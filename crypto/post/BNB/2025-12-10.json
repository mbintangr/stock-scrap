Meanwhile, trader 0x8A70 paid just 0.794 BNB ($709) in gas, bought 28.8M DOYR for 239 BNB ($213,820), and sold for 282.5 BNB ($252K) — a $38K profit (≈15%).  The irony? 0xa7b5 paid almost 10× more, yet still bought one second slower than 0x8A70.

A confirmed breakout above this resistance would signal that bearish momentum is fading and buyers are regaining control. If bulls manage to push and sustain price above the channel, the next upside targets sit at $960, $1,020, $1,100, 1,180, and $1,310.   This structure is important because descending channels typically lead to strong trend shifts once price breaks out, especially when volume supports the move. As always, confirmation is crucial before assuming continuation.","gravity_id":"371813849","id":17687,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T17:30:17.090Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T17:50:16.447Z"}]
