You pivot, you fail, you improve and you keep going. The market decides the true winners over time.\nOn bringing culture onchain, CZ said IP can thrive on blockchain, but simply uploading content is not enough.\n\nNew models like micropayments, interactivity and global monetisation will unlock real adoption.\n\nBNB Chain welcomes this experimentation. \nPrivacy came up as a major theme with CZ calling it a basic human right.\n\nHe noted that blockchain today is often too transparent and that users should have the option to transact and trade privately, while still meeting compliance requirements. \nOn decentralisation, CZ explained that it is not a binary concept, it exists on a spectrum.\n\nNode count, team control, governance and performance trade-offs all play a role.\n\nThe goal is continual improvement over time. \nHe also spoke about AI’s role in trading and future onchain activity.\n\nAI agents will handle millions of small transactions. This will require extremely fast blockchains that can support high throughput at low cost.\n\nBNB Chain’s performance roadmap is aimed squarely at this future.\nRWAs show long-term promise, especially stablecoins, but assets like buildings and equities still face liquidity and regulatory hurdles.\n\nBNB Chain already supports one of the most active stablecoin environments, with almost $2B in total asset value*, giving the ecosystem an advantage as the category matures.\n\n*Source: @DefiLlama\nSectors with the most potential on BNB Chain include AI, stablecoins, derivatives and prediction markets.\n\nBreakout categories tend to emerge from strong teams, not hype cycles.\n\nBNB Chain can also become the home for AI-driven applications. That progress depends on direct input from developers, which is why community feedback shapes so much of the chain’s roadmap.\nCZ closed by saying crypto gives builders opportunities that traditional finance never could. Small teams can build meaningful products.\n\nBNB Chain will continue supporting the developers who choose to build for the long term.

Real discovery cannot grow on fragile infrastructure.\n\nThe ecosystem also supports builders beyond the protocol:\n\n🔸 BNB Hacks help early teams test ideas and meet users, while BNB Trenches keeps them moving after the event\n🔸  When teams begin raising, the $1B Builder Fund from @yzilabs helps refine the product and prepare a real go-to-market plan\n🔸 Once projects are ready for users, BNB Chain’s BD & marketing teams help them reach the right communities\n\nDiscovery requires visibility, and the ecosystem helps direct it to builders who are ready.\nThe roadmap pushes discovery further:\n\nBNB Chain is:\n🔸 Working toward sub-second finality\n🔸 Targeting 20,000 TPS for advanced DeFi\n🔸 Rolling out plug-and-play developer libraries\n🔸 Improving the UX to match Web2 simplicity with Web3 transparency\n\nThe goal is a simple user experience with transparent onchain activity underneath.\nBNB Chain is where discovery can scale because liquidity, users, infrastructure and builder support all exist in one place, and anyone can take part.\n\n🔸 Liquidity providers can explore opportunities in the ecosystem.\n🔸 Users can try BNB Chain projects and attend demo days.\n🔸 Builders can join BNB Hacks or apply to upcoming programs.\n\nThe ecosystem is ready for people who want to build.","gravity_id":"371842606","id":19552,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T12:10:16.610Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T13:50:18.303Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-11T12:31:13.111Z","text_content":"$BNB taking a breather at ~$866 after that wild run-up.
