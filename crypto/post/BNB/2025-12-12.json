On the other hand, repeated rejections around the current range open the path for a continuation lower, with the 750 to 700 region acting as the next meaningful downside target.

This type of behavior typically signals that the market is storing energy before its next major expansion. The daily structure highlights two critical boundaries: the lower support near the 780 zone and the upper resistance cluster toward 1100.    A decisive break from this range will determine the next trend phase. If buyers regain control and drive price above 900 with conviction, $BNB  opens a path toward inefficiencies left behind during the previous decline, particularly the 1100 to 1150 area.   Conversely, continued hesitation at the midpoint increases the probability of a downside leg toward 750.
