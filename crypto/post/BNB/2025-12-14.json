Here’s a clear bit of perspective on why onchain meme coins and NFTs actually matter.\n\nIf you look at Solana, BNB, Ethereum and others, every major run to all time highs was backed by massive onchain activity. NFTs in 2021 and 2023. Meme coins driving volume. That activity forces people to buy the native asset, move it onchain, and use it. That’s what creates demand, liquidity, and real price discovery.\n\nMeme coins aren’t everyone’s taste, but history is very clear: they are one of the most powerful onboarding and volume engines crypto has ever had.\n\nNow look at the XRPL side of things.\n\nThe XRPL meme ecosystem is still very new. The largest meme coin ever peaked around ~$100M. Today, the biggest projects sit under ~$10M. Daily meme coin volume across the ledger is roughly ~$5M. Compare that to Solana or BNB doing tens of billions per day even today during bearish times. \n\nThat gap alone shows how early this is. We’re talking a potential 1,000x expansion in onchain activity, not speculation pulled out of thin air.\n\nXRP is a top three crypto by market cap, with a ~$200B valuation, yet its largest memes are still tiny by comparison. Even chains like AVAX, ADA, and others already have meme coins valued in the hundreds of millions or billions. It’s unrealistic to think XRP won’t follow the same path as adoption and liquidity increase.\n\nMeme coins help:\n> Lock XRP on-chain\n> Drive volume and fees\n> Accelerate price discovery\n> Onboard new users fast\n\nLearning how the XRPL meme economy works isn’t just about upside. It’s about supporting the ecosystem while positioning yourself to potentially compound more XRP along the way.\n\nEarly doesn’t last forever.\n\nFollow us to learn more.","gravity_id":"371916470","id":24683,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T19:30:02.453Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T23:50:20.004Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-13T19:36:38.095Z","text_content":"$BNB\nExpecting BNB to go up in the coming days","gravity_id":"371913995","id":24716,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T19:40:18.060Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T23:50:19.855Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-13T20:22:26.481Z","text_content":"The chart told the whole story.
