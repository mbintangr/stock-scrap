The aggressive bearish candle indicates panic selling, but the immediate bounce from the demand zone around 840–845 suggests buyers are still active at discounted levels. As long as price holds above this support base, a short-term long opportunity remains valid, with upside potential toward 880–888 where previous imbalance and resistance are placed. This move would be considered a corrective rebound rather than a full trend reversal unless price reclaims higher structure.\n\n\nOn the flip side, if $BNB fails to sustain above the 848–850 support zone and shows weakness again, the bounce could turn into a short continuation setup. A rejection from the 865–870 area would confirm that sellers are still in control, opening the door for another move toward 835 and potentially deeper levels. Until buyers show strong follow-through above resistance, rallies should be treated cautiously and managed as short-term trades.\n\n\nVolatility remains high; holding above support favors a relief bounce, while rejection near resistance will likely lead to another bearish continuation.","gravity_id":"371974756","id":28951,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T19:20:20.425Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T00:30:20.978Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-15T20:19:45.098Z","text_content":"🚀 According to the data from CoinGecko, Solana maintains blockchain dominance with 26.79% interest share in 2025 as Sui and BNB Chain surge into top five after doubling market presence.\n\n#Solana #Base #Ethereum\nhttps://cryptonews.com/news/solana-dominates-crypto-attention-for-second-straight-year-analysis/?feed_id=24636&_unique_id=6940620c1e302","gravity_id":"371976450","id":29060,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T20:20:19.764Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T01:00:21.316Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-15T21:05:13.657Z","text_content":"Why we’re confident about CA going forward  Cronos Army is no longer limited to a single chain or a single feature set.
