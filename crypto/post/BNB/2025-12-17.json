The breakdown below the 868–870 support confirms bearish continuation, and any minor pullback toward the broken support zone is likely to face rejection.\n\n\nTrade Setup 📉\n\t•\tEntry Point: 865 – 868\n\t•\tStop Loss: 875\n\t•\tTake Profit:\n\t•\tTP1: 855\n\t•\tTP2: 848\n\t•\tTP3: 840\n\t•\tMargin: 2–3% of wallet\n\t•\tLeverage: 10x\n\n\nOverall structure remains bearish, with lower highs and lower lows in play. As long as price stays below the 872–875 resistance zone, further downside continuation is expected toward the lower support levels.","gravity_id":"372021541","id":31933,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T04:10:22.988Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T06:00:28.422Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-17T04:32:16.246Z","text_content":"Another gem spotted early,  $IR, a DeFi infrastructure token built on  $BNB Chain, is set to go live in less than 8 hours.\n\nInfrared serves as core infrastructure for Berachain’s Proof-of-Liquidity ecosystem, providing liquid staking, validator infrastructure, and automated PoL vaults that support yield and governance.\n\nThe #IR/USDT listing on #BingX is currently in countdown mode, with trading opening soon and a limited zero-fee period at launch.\n\nI’ll be watching the market open and how price structure develops.\n\nAre you planning to trade the open or observe first?\n#BNBChain#","gravity_id":"372021883","id":31964,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T04:40:22.274Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T06:20:23.719Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-17T04:46:45.188Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\npredict.$FUN has been launched, conducting an airdrop of initial points to prediction market participants and $BNB Chain transaction users\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372024023","id":31976,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T04:50:07.652Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T07:10:23.427Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-17T04:46:45.171Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\npredict.$FUN has been launched, initiating an airdrop of initial tokens to prediction market participants and $BNB Chain transaction users.\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372024021","id":31978,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T04:50:08.262Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T06:50:24.857Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-17T04:56:49.445Z","text_content":"$BNB  The community rooms for #W1W , DeBox, and OG Foundation are now live in the Destiny Arena!
