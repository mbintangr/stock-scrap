The recent move from 818 is a relief bounce, not a confirmed trend reversal. Price has now reached a strong supply zone around 850–855, where sellers have already shown interest.

As long as $BNB  fails to break and hold above 865, downside risk remains higher than upside.  From a market perspective, sentiment across large caps remains cautious, and BNB is moving in sync with broader market weakness. This favors fade trades at resistance instead of chasing upside.
