As real-world asset tokenization expands across equities, bonds, and funds, demand for efficient infrastructure could increase, supporting long-term BNB utility.\n\n Regulatory clarity remains a key variable for sustained institutional adoption.\nTechnical Structure\nBNB recently rebounded from the $840 uptrend support and is now capped near $928, a level acting as structural resistance. A confirmed breakout above this zone could open upside toward the $1,060–$1,080 range, while rejection risks a move back toward $840 and potentially $790.
