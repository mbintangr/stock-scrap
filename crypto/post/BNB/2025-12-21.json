That extended stay below a key long-term level highlights ongoing weakness and keeps the broader structure fragile.  On the fundamental side, there was a notable ecosystem move where BNB rallied to $858 on a 7.7% jump, driven by institutional demand and rising on-chain activity. This suggests that despite the technical pullback, underlying participation and network strength remain intact and could support buyers if structure turns back up.  From a technical perspective, BNB needs to reclaim and hold above the 200-day SMA to ease bearish pressure. Until then, price action  leans toward consolidation or mild bearishness, even as fundamentals show areas of demand. ﻿Follow to stay updated  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #BNBChain#","gravity_id":"372143298","id":40095,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T18:10:24.810Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T23:10:24.332Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-20T18:00:00.246Z","text_content":"🔻 $BNB  stalls after failing to extend the rebound  Price pushed higher within a rising intraday channel but is now showing hesitation right below a layered resistance zone.  📉 Technical View: • Pattern: Rising corrective channel pressing into supply • Bias: Bearish while price remains constrained beneath the upper boundary • Key Level: Upper channel resistance and the nearby horizontal supply band  ✅Full analytics in telegram->  bit.ly/cryptolingrid \r \r  ⚠️ The downside expectation would lose traction if price decisively clears the channel top and stabilizes above the highlighted resistance, suggesting sellers are no longer defending the zone.  #BNB  #BNBChain  #BNB Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372142326","id":40096,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T18:10:25.028Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T23:00:24.875Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-20T18:41:10.626Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $BNB","gravity_id":"372142597","id":40149,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T18:50:24.897Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T20:00:26.205Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-20T18:41:06.603Z","text_content":"I’m bearish on $BNB","gravity_id":"372142596","id":40150,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T18:50:25.123Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T20:00:26.429Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-20T19:05:24.519Z","text_content":"Is #POLY  Coming Soon? 👀\r \r One thing is for sure: Polymarket is leading prediction markets with major $SOL  and $BNB  deposits on the platform.\r \r The launch of a native token is also nearing, with speculations around how airdrops are executed.\r \r For all I know, this is where trades will be rewarded\r \r #Polymarket","gravity_id":"372144185","id":40178,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T19:10:23.880Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-21T02:50:24.569Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-20T19:01:45.047Z","text_content":"\nWhat Stability World AI offers:\n🟢 Stake & earn BNB with APR up to 130%\n🟢AI tools for image generation, video creation, face swap, art style transfer & NFT creation\n🟢AI Agents that generate shapes and complete fixed-target tasks\n🟢 Web3 AI APIs for developers\n🟢 SW Nodes to scale AI & Web3 projects efficiently\nEcosystem growth so far:\n✅ Listed on MEXC, PancakeSwap, Gate Alpha & CoinGecko\n✅ 72,000+ active users\n✅ 100,000+ community members across social platforms & Galxe\n✅ 400,000+ AI artworks created\n✅ AI APIs integrated into multiple Web3 projects\n✅ AMAs with 10,000+ listeners consistently\nWhy Stability World AI matters\nWe’re not just building a platform we’re creating a space where AI is accessible, rewarding, and community-driven.\nWhether you’re a creator, developer, investor, or Web3 enthusiast, Stability World AI empowers you to create, earn, and grow.","gravity_id":"372143643","id":40179,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T19:10:24.097Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-21T02:30:26.108Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-20T19:15:00.069Z","text_content":"Binance New Listing Announcement 2026: Bitcoin Tags $90K Before Slipping as Rumors of Potential DeepSnitch AI  Listing on the World’s #1 Crypto Exchange Spread  #Binance   $BNB    Sponsored   https://captainaltcoin.com/binance-new-listing-announcement-2026-bitcoin-tags-90k-before-slipping-as-rumors-of-potential-deepsnitch-ai-listing-on-the-worlds-1-crypto-exchange-spread/","gravity_id":"372141857","id":40196,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T19:20:24.270Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-21T06:10:27.466Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-20T19:30:23.324Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $BNB","gravity_id":"372141934","id":40217,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T19:30:25.390Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T20:00:24.886Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-20T19:30:20.383Z","text_content":"I’m bearish on $BNB","gravity_id":"372142896","id":40218,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T19:30:25.609Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T20:00:25.103Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-20T19:24:50.703Z","text_content":"Asia woke up on $BNB  in 2017… now it’s $DOOD ’s turn 🚀  $BNB  proved rails alone can build empires.
