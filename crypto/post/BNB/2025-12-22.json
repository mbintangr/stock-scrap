But this one? It should.   🔥 XRP and BNB are locked in a neck-and-neck race for the top-three non-stablecoin spot — with just ~ $1.35B separating their market caps.  As of now, $BNB  sits around $117.7B, and XRP trails at $116.36B. One decent daily move could flip the leaderboard. What’s wild is the divergence in activity: XRP is being traded harder — $2.41B vs BNB’s $1.4B in 24h volume — yet BNB holds a higher market cap and year-to-date performance (+31% vs. -12%).  👉 To me, this is a narrative fight. BNB leans on infrastructure: burns, BNB Chain, exchange flows.   XRP depends on external wins: payment adoption, legal clarity, and institutional buzz.  👀 Who takes the edge?

Maple packaged private credit into a yield-bearing stablecoin. \n3/ Tokenized public-market RWA value tripled to $17b YTD, marking the strongest expansion the sector has seen since inception.\n\nBlackRock’s BUIDL emerged as the reserve asset underpinning a new class of onchain cash products, including Ethena’s USDtb and Ondo’s OUSG. \n4/ Perp DEX to CEX volume ratio tripled to 19% YTD, reflecting major improvements in execution speed, liquidity depth, and overall UX.\n\nHyperliquid remained the incumbent, but well-funded entrants like Lighter and Aster used incentives to challenge its lead. \n5/ Prediction market volume reached ATH in Q4 after experiencing a slowdown post-US election.\n\nBoth Polymarket and Kalshi raised 9-figure funding rounds in 2025, signalling growing institutional conviction in event contracts as an emerging derivatives category. \n6/ Spot DEX volume stagnated.\n\nSolana’s memecoin-driven activity collapsed, while BNB Chain absorbed a larger share of retail speculation.\n\nSpot DEX to CEX volume ratio hovered below 20%, indicating that the structural efficiency gap in spot trading remains largely unchanged. \nSum/ Taken together, 2025 showed DeFi progressing toward a more durable equilibrium, with maturing primitives and expanding institutional alignment laying the groundwork for broader growth ahead.\nfin/ For a full breakdown of the development and trends of DeFi and other crypto sectors, check out 2026 Digital Assets Outlook Report by @TheBlock__ 👇\n\nAnd a big thank you to @GK8_Security for sponsoring the report!\nhttps://www.theblock.co/post/383020/2026-digital-assets-outlook-report","gravity_id":"372203181","id":43840,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T17:20:04.894Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-22T17:50:26.316Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-22T17:11:35.504Z","text_content":"$BNB is showing recovery signs on the chart, trading above MA7 and MA25 with increased volume.
