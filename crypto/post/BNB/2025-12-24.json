A breakdown below the 50-week SMA near 775 could strengthen bearish momentum, potentially pushing price toward the key support zone around 500. Bulls are expected to defend the broader 400–500 range.  Historically, sharp declines are often followed by extended consolidation phases. If a similar pattern plays out, $BNB   could remain range-bound between 500 and 930 for some time.  On the upside, a weekly close above the 20-week EMA would signal improving bullish control, opening the door for a move toward 1,182 and eventually a retest of the all-time high near 1,375.
