DEXs (incl perps) keep on-chain volumes sticky.\n\n2/7\n⚡ Exchange-Grade Throughput\n\nFermi is slated for mainnet on Jan 14, 2026, bringing 0.75s → 0.45s blocks, fast-finality stability, plus EVM “Super Instructions.” With gas limits targeting higher throughput, 2026 could feel more like a CEX, on-chain.\n\n3/7\n🔄 opBNB Becomes Default\n\nopBNB’s Volta cut block time to 500ms, and Fourier goes mainnet on Jan 7, 2026 to 250ms. Expect games/social/micro-tx to default to opBNB, while higher-value DeFi settles back to BSC when needed.\n\n4/7 \n🕵️ Privacy, But Usable\n\nThe roadmap flags protocol-level privacy for transfers + contract calls, pitched as “compliance-friendly” confidentiality. If delivered, it will unlock private payroll, stealth execution, and enterprise flows that can’t be fully public.\n\n5/7\n💰 Can BNB Reclaim $1,000?\n\nNot a forecast: BNB is ~$838 today. If 2026 ships the roadmap + keeps DEX demand strong, $1K becomes a level to watch.
