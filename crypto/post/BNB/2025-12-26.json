The gains outpaced the broader cryptocurrency market, which remained largely flat during the same period.  DTCC revealed Dec. 17 that it would tokenize a portion of U.S. Treasuries held at its Depository Trust Company subsidiary using the #CantonNetwork  infrastructure. The organization operates post-trade infrastructure for U.S. securities markets, with subsidiaries processing about $3.7 quadrillion in securities transactions last year.  Frank La Salla, DTCC CEO, stated the collaboration establishes a roadmap for bringing real-world, high-value #tokenization  use cases to market. The initiative will begin with U.S. Treasury securities before expanding to a broader range of DTC-eligible assets, he said.  Canton Network operates as a permissioned blockchain designed for regulated financial institutions to issue and settle tokenized real-world assets. Canton Coin serves as the network's native token, supporting transactions and core network operations.  The token's performance contrasted sharply with major cryptocurrencies during the week. Bitcoin and Ethereum both declined approximately 0.5%, while $BNB  fell 0.9%, and Solana dropped around 3.3%, reports Cointelegraph.  Tokenization of #real-world  assets has emerged as a significant development in 2025, with total distributed value more than tripling from roughly $5.6 billion at the end of 2024 to approximately $19 billion currently, RWA.xyz data shows. U.S. Treasury products account for a substantial portion of that #expansion .  Around $9 billion in Treasury debt has been tokenized, up from approximately $3.9 billion at the start of the year.","gravity_id":"372289904","id":49719,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T02:40:16.901Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T05:30:51.901Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-26T02:48:37.008Z","text_content":"🔥 Despite a volatile year, a few altcoins stayed green: $BNB  (+19%), $TRX  (+9%), BCH (+23%), and HYPE (+0,32%). ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372290796","id":49734,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T02:50:16.589Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T05:40:18.547Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-26T03:00:00.132Z","text_content":"$BNB  Already Scaled as #BlockchainFX ’s Trading Platform Goes Live Soon, and a Limited Bonus Window Remains   Sponsored   https://captainaltcoin.com/bnb-already-scaled-as-blockchainfxs-trading-platform-goes-live-soon-and-a-limited-bonus-window-remains/","gravity_id":"372291300","id":49748,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T03:00:21.595Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T06:00:22.230Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-26T03:01:45.061Z","text_content":"BODA NFTs Are Packed With Real Benefits!\n\n💎 0% BodaSwap Fees When Holding NFT\n💎 BodaSwap VIP Access\n💎 Airdrops for NFT Holders\n💎 Whitelist for Token Presales\n💎 Play to Earn Game Access\n💎 Staking Bonuses\n💎 And Much More!\n\nBoda NFTs are available for BNB Chain, Ethereum, Base, and Polygon!

By announcing an official partnership with Kryptos and enforcing it in line with the 31 January deadline, Binance has clearly demonstrated that, under regulatory pressure, it prioritizes its own survival over user privacy and user interests.\n\n\nThis is not merely a “technical” or “tax-related” partnership. It represents a direct transfer of risk, oversight, and legal consequences from the exchange to the user. The message is unmistakable: in critical moments, users are the first to be sacrificed.\n\n\nHowever, if real unity and solidarity emerge among traders and users, it becomes possible to make a collective, informed decision to leave such platforms and turn this into a powerful lesson for other exchanges. A lesson that makes it clear users are not powerless—and that trust is not something to be traded away. Ignoring this warning today may lead to serious and irreversible consequences tomorrow.","gravity_id":"372300425","id":50626,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T13:30:17.291Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T16:10:17.961Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2025-12-26T13:55:45.042Z","text_content":"Markets slowed into the evening prices stayed calm, but eyes stayed open.\n\nLow volatility, steady charts, and that familiar feeling… something’s loading.\n\n26 Dec Evening Snapshot:\n\n BTC: $88,899 (+1.31%) – steady climb, buyers in control\n\n ETH: $2,968 (+0.85%) – quietly strong, no panic moves\n\n BNB: $840 (-0.35%) – minor dip, structure intact\n\nHeadlines kept the undertone bullish:\n\n• Ethereum’s 2026 Glamsterdam upgrade targets higher gas limits, blob expansion & MEV fixes\n\n• 2026 shaping up as the year Ethereum scales aggressively with ZK tech\n\n• Cardano’s Hoskinson calls “Midnight” the Manhattan Project of privacy\n\nWhile majors stayed disciplined, microcaps stole the spotlight:\n\n FELIS +2999% | DOGO +1999% | BOME +525%\nLine of the evening:\n\n Calm charts.
