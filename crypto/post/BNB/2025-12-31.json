The recent sell-off into the highlighted support was aggressively bought, confirming strong buy-side interest at discounted levels. Market structure is shifting as BNB reclaims key intraday levels and pushes back into the range equilibrium.    This setup suggests a classic accumulation-to-expansion phase, where liquidity has already been collected below the lows. If price holds above the reclaimed mid-range and breaks local resistance, continuation toward the marked upside target becomes highly probable.    However, failure to sustain above current levels could trigger a deeper pullback toward the demand zone for another liquidity sweep.
