While volatility remains controlled, BNB continues to trade in line with real ecosystem usage rather than hype-driven spikes.

As capital rotates between major Layer-1s, ETH’s moves may increasingly mirror this “usage-first” trend.

That big red candle on the hourly is a bit of a reality check after that nice climb.\nRight now, we are sitting at 906.78 and it feels like we're back in that familiar chop zone. There's some decent support around the 900 to 903 area, but if that doesn't hold, we might be looking at a trip back down to 890.\nVolume is looking a bit thin on this bounce attempt.
