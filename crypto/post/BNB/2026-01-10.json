That tells us this move is not random — it’s controlled and confident.\n\nRight now, BNB is building strength again after the last push. As long as price holds above the key support area, the bullish structure stays valid and the next leg higher remains likely.\n\nIf momentum continues to build, the next upside expansion can target the $1,200–$1,350 range first.
