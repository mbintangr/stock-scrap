This development carries significant weight for $ASTER  and various other tokens on the BNB Chain.  Should $BNB  manage to break and close decisively above $930, anticipate a substantial rally across the entire BNB Chain ecosystem.Beyond that, such a move would further reinforce the case for a broader Supercycle in crypto.   Currently, BNB is trading around $900–$910 based on live market data, sitting just below that key $930 level—making this threshold a critical watch point right now. #BNB Chain#","gravity_id":"372813211","id":83808,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T16:10:28.319Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T17:10:30.740Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-13T16:16:41.817Z","text_content":"What percentage of your net worth is in crypto? $BNB  $PENGU \r \r 🤖 Free AI signals → finorabot.com","gravity_id":"372813273","id":83833,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T16:20:29.786Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T17:20:31.832Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-13T16:16:03.878Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $BNB","gravity_id":"372813269","id":83834,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T16:20:30.053Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T17:20:32.097Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-13T16:27:07.055Z","text_content":"4 hours watching charts: $0 made 45 seconds with Finora AI: Setup identified Your AI Trade Buddy works while you live ⏱️ $ETH  $BNB  👉 Start now: finorabot.com","gravity_id":"372813335","id":83837,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T16:30:02.637Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T17:20:31.296Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-13T16:25:45.037Z","text_content":"BASE Mini-apps season is here\n\nanyone can build and launch mini-apps on Base in hours or just a few days, then it comes to driving adoption and usage of the apps. \n\nnow we have @Bappfun entering to allow anyone to fundraise for their apps, you can sign up and apply to create a token and raise funds for development. \n\nif BASE is going to compete with BNB and the main chains, then they need to onboard millions of retail users to their app ecosystem.","gravity_id":"372812986","id":83856,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T16:30:30.223Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T17:20:31.562Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-13T16:39:16.427Z","text_content":"$BNB new ATH soon?","gravity_id":"372815110","id":83883,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T16:40:31.008Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T17:20:31.031Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-13T16:55:45.100Z","text_content":"YZi Labs backs Genius to build a private, high-speed on-chain trading terminal, targeting CEX-like execution across $ETH, $BNB, $SOL, and more in 2026 ","gravity_id":"372813508","id":83902,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T17:00:04.662Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T17:40:30.711Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-13T16:59:44.270Z","text_content":"After Bitget launched Tradfi with over 80 assets, including $XAUt  , events were bound to follow, and in no time, the Tradfi Gold Trading Competition Phase 1 followed.
