The upcoming Intelligent Privacy Pool developed with @0xbowio, will utilize \"Association Sets\" and ZK attestation to confirm that user funds are clean before transacting privately, a crucial step for institutional onchain adoption.\n\nThe benefits extend beyond private money transfers, enabling:\n🔸 Fair prediction markets: Algorithms can be verified as fair without disclosing proprietary logic.\n🔸 SocialFi verification: Real users can be verified without exposing their net worth.\n🔸 Verifiable AI: Models can be safely trained using private data.\n\nWe believe privacy is no longer just a simple toggle switch but a programmable layer.
