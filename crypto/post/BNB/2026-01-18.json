My thesis is valid mainly for Bitcoin and I extend this analysis to some other major projects, such as BNB, but this doesn't have to be the case. It can happen that Binance Coin behaves differently to Bitcoin... Well, who knows, but we need to stay open to all scenarios. First, let's focus on the short-term.\n\nBinance Coin has been closing four consecutive weeks green. The previous two weeks, those that closed red, were sideways, and before these two, two additional green weeks.\n\nSo the low happened the 17-November 2025 week, 21-Nov., and the action is always happening above support—blue space on the chart coupled with the 0.618 fib. retracement level. Notice how BNB is now full green, the biggest candle since the start of this recovery, while moving above EMA21 (yellow line).\n\nThe move above EMA21 is happening for the first time since the correction. Last time it was late June 2025 and this signaled a major, major advance ending in a new all-time high.\n\nMarket conditions are absolutely awesome here and this further supports bullish action on Bitcoin, Cardano, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Avalanche, XRP and all those projects that move with this same group.\n\nAs usual: When in doubt, look around. We are headed up next. While the big projects consolidate their small recovery, the smaller altcoins are breaking up with force. Just a few days of rest on the bigger projects produces a major advance on the smaller altcoins.\n\nSoon, we will have FOMO all across the market; everything grows. Not everything, but the majority of the projects. Some will grow many times more than others. Those that I am sharing on a daily basis and the PREMIUM channels have preference.

Over the past 24 hours, BNB price increased by 0.9% to $938.2, with a market cap of $127.9 billion.\n\nConsidering its latest move, BNB now moves closer to hitting the $1,000 mark. BNB closed higher after breaking above the $920 key resistance.\n\nIf the move continues, analysts have predicted that the BNB price may head toward the next resistance zone between $1050 and $1080.\n\nThe potential launch of a BNB ETF is one key factor that could fuel the move towards $1,000. Just a few hours after Grayscale announced the filing of its incoming spot BNB ETF, the BNB price posted 2% gains.\n\nFermi Hardfork Live on Mainnet\nMeanwhile, the Fermi hard fork upgrade is now live on BNB Smart Chain. Developers activated the upgrade on mainnet on Jan. 14, 2026, at 02:30 UTC, supported by the v1.6.4 client release.\n\nFollowing the Fermi mainnet activation, block time dropped from 0.75 seconds to 0.45 seconds, improving transaction speed and dApp responsiveness.\n\nFermi also adds more parameter updates, improvements, and bug fixes to the BNB network.\n\nAdditionally, Fermi introduces updated voting rules for fast finality through BEP-590 to support frequent block production.\n\nEssentially, Fermi makes the network faster without compromising reliability.
