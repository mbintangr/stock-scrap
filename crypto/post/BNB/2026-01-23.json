Arch Joins Bitcoin News and 21 Rates as Launch Partner for \"The Daily Stack\"\r \r NEW YORK, January 19, 2026 — Arch, the institutional-grade platform for crypto-backed lending, has joined as an official launch partner for \"The Daily Stack,\" a daily Bitcoin broadcast co-produced by Bitcoin News and 21 Rates.\r \r The show launches as the Bitcoin economy continues its shift from early adoption into mainstream finance. \"The Daily Stack\" is designed to move beyond traditional headlines, serving as a daily intelligence hub for Bitcoin investors and builders.\r \r The show will focus on three areas: daily market briefings covering developments across the Bitcoin ecosystem, in-depth profiles of the builders and capital allocators shaping the next phase of growth, and live integration of 21 Rates' interest rate data alongside institutional lending insights from Arch.\r \r The teams behind Bitcoin News and 21 Rates have previously hosted conversations with Michael Saylor, Eric Trump, Grant Cardone, and Adam Back.\r \r \"Infrastructure is only as powerful as the education that surrounds it,\" said Dhruv Patel, CEO of Arch. \"At Arch, we provide the secure, non-rehypothecated lending rails that the market needs, and 'The Daily Stack' provides the context. Partnering with a team that has already interviewed the world's most influential voices allows us to help bridge the gap between institutional sophistication and the broader Bitcoin community.\"\r \r The partnership follows Arch's recent close of a $75M tokenized CLO, a first-of-its-kind transaction bringing private credit on-chain. As a launch partner, Arch will contribute institutional perspectives to the show, helping viewers understand the mechanics of credit and liquidity in a maturing market.\r \r $BTC  #binance  $BNB","gravity_id":"373132533","id":102907,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T11:30:28.045Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T13:40:29.381Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-23T11:57:23.302Z","text_content":"$BNB These tokens were created anonymously and they made millions of dollars, you keep seeing news tokens everyday and they're making alot of money, it's time for you to create yours with our step by step guide.","gravity_id":"373131794","id":102954,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T12:00:27.252Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T13:50:30.254Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-23T11:51:15.163Z","text_content":"$BNB Price rejected hard from the 950–960 supply zone and saw strong bearish continuation.\nCurrently consolidating around 888, after a sharp sell-off.\n\n\nBelow supply = bearish bias\nKey demand near 860–870\nReclaim above 920 needed for any bullish shift\n\n\nPatience here — let price show its hand\n\n\n#BNb","gravity_id":"373131755","id":102955,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T12:00:27.499Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T13:50:30.490Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-23T12:25:50.997Z","text_content":"📊 Base outpaces ETH and BNB in DEX volume  Base tops Ethereum and BNB Chain in decentralized exchange trading volume.  #Base  #DEX  #Ethereum  #BNBChain  $BNB  $ETH    https://crypto-economy.com/dex-shock-base-overtakes-ethereum-and-bnb-chain-in-volume/","gravity_id":"373133066","id":103009,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T12:30:03.209Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T14:10:30.462Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-23T12:28:45.080Z","text_content":"We’re excited to announce our integration with @SPACEID!\n\nConnect to WheelX using 20+ Web3 Names (.bnb, .arb, .ip & more) powered by SPACE ID, and enjoy seamless digital identity access.\n\nTry it now 👉 https://wheelx.fi/ ","gravity_id":"373135002","id":103025,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T12:30:26.845Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T14:10:30.233Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-23T12:38:55.870Z","text_content":"How to Compare Crypto Exchange Trading Fees in 2026  Introduction Trading fees may look small, but they add up over time, especially for active traders. In 2026, crypto exchanges still use different fee models for spot trades, futures, and withdrawals. Knowing where fees apply helps users avoid surprises and choose better-value platforms.  🔹What trading fees do crypto exchanges charge? Most platforms use maker and taker fees. Maker fees apply when adding liquidity, while taker fees apply when removing it. Other costs may include withdrawal fees, funding fees for leverage, and spreads on instant buys. Fee discounts often depend on trading volume.  🔹How do major exchanges compare on fees? Binance ($BNB ) – Low futures fees, strong volume discounts Bitget – Competitive spot and futures pricing Kraken – Moderate fees, high transparency Coinbase – Higher spot fees, simpler experience No exchange is cheapest for every trader.  🔹Is the lowest-fee exchange always best? Not always. Liquidity, execution quality, and platform stability can matter just as much as fees.  Conclusion Comparing trading fees in 2026 means looking beyond headline rates. The best exchange is the one whose full fee structure fits how often and how actively a user trades.  FAQs 1. Why do trading fees matter? They directly reduce profits. 2. Do fees change over time? Yes, based on volume and market conditions.

Let's break down each of them?  🔸 1. Tokenization & RWA: BNBChain is playing the growth game. Its tokenized asset growth is nearly 2x faster than Ethereum's over the last 30 days. How? CZ is personally engaging with governments to bring real-world assets on-chain.  🔸 2. AI agents: we are moving toward a \"machine-to-machine\" economy. CZ highlights the rise of autonomous AI wallets using crypto for payments without human intervention. BNBChain is positioned to be the high-speed rails for these agents.  🔸 3. Scalable payments: The network's stress test - handling $14B in withdrawals in a single week - proves it has the \"Battle-Tested\" scale needed for global payment systems.  📈 In 2025, BNBChain's stablecoin inflows jumped 94%, outperforming Ethereum’s relative growth rate (46%). We're now seeing Binance's native network shifting from a retail DeFi hub to a fundamentals-led infrastructure for RWAs and AI.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #BNBChain#","gravity_id":"373139480","id":103508,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T16:30:26.835Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T17:40:29.331Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-23T16:24:39.293Z","text_content":"🚨 Silver just hit $100 for the first time in history. $BNB","gravity_id":"373138469","id":103509,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T16:30:27.068Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T17:40:29.562Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-23T16:22:18.396Z","text_content":"BREAKING: Grayscale has filed an S-1 registration for a $BNB   ETF. #BNBChain#","gravity_id":"373138455","id":103510,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T16:30:27.303Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T17:30:28.821Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-23T16:21:29.163Z","text_content":"🚨 A year in review highlights how $BNB  Chain focused on production ready upgrades through 2025, prioritizing reliability, lower fees and predictable performance as usage scaled.
