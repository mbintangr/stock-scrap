Tokenization & RWA:\nBNB Chain is playing the long-term growth game. Its tokenized asset growth is nearly 2× faster than Ethereum’s over the last 30 days. How? CZ is personally engaging with governments to bring real-world assets on-chain.\n2. AI Agents:\nWe are moving toward a machine-to-machine economy. CZ highlights the rise of autonomous AI wallets using crypto for payments without human intervention. BNB Chain is positioned to be the high-speed rails for these agents.\n3. Scalable Payments:\nThe network’s stress test — handling $14B in withdrawals in a single week — proves it has the battle-tested scale needed for global payment systems.\nIn 2025, BNB Chain’s stablecoin inflows jumped 94%, outperforming Ethereum’s relative growth rate (46%). We’re now seeing Binance’s native network shifting from a retail DeFi hub to a fundamentals-led infrastructure for RWAs and AI.","gravity_id":"373151711","id":104385,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T05:10:26.984Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T08:40:27.859Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-24T06:03:02.716Z","text_content":"$BNB   Grayscale files S-1 for BNB ETF.","gravity_id":"373152762","id":104432,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T06:10:26.110Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T08:50:28.316Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-24T07:22:53.040Z","text_content":"$BNB  ,\r Reports surfaced that Grayscale filed an S-1 with the SEC for a #binancecoin  ETF; thе report lacks primary-sourсe confirmаtion.\r \r As of Jan 24, 2026, no matching EDGAR filign or official Grayscale statement has been locatеd - treat the news as unconfirmed pending SEC or issuer disclosure.\r \r #Macro Insights#  #Grayscale    https://transscreen.ru/en/CMK_news29441","gravity_id":"373154382","id":104520,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T07:30:26.156Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T09:00:28.127Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-24T07:40:45.110Z","text_content":"Markets moved sideways today as majors stayed range-bound, sentiment remained calm and balanced. 📊\n\nNo pumps, no panic.

Grayscale’s BNB ETF Filing Is a Big Deal for Crypto\n\nGrayscale filing for a $BNB ETF is a strong signal of how far crypto has come, especially beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. \n\nThe proposed ETF would give traditional investors regulated exposure to BNB, one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap and the core asset of the Binance ecosystem. \n\nInstead of holding the token directly, investors could access BNB through a familiar structure on public markets, which lowers technical barriers and expands participation from institutions that can’t hold crypto outright.\n\nGrayscale already manages multiple crypto investment products, and its decision to pursue a BNB ETF suggests regulators and infrastructure are becoming mature enough to support more diversified crypto exposure. \n\nIf approved, this could open the door for increased liquidity, broader adoption and more ETF filings tied to large Layer-1 and exchange-based tokens, pushing crypto further into mainstream finance.\n\n#Macro Insights# #BNBChain#

While momentum cooled after last week’s bearish trend, BNB has avoided deeper downside, suggesting sellers are losing control. This comes as Bitcoin hovers near $89K and Ethereum attempts to stabilize, hinting at a broader market reset rather than renewed weakness.  The key development is Grayscale filing an S-1 with the U.S. SEC for a spot BNB ETF. If approved, this would be a major milestone for Binance Coin, pushing it further into regulated institutional markets. The proposed Grayscale BNB ETF would trade on Nasdaq under the ticker GBNB, with Coinbase acting as prime broker and custodian. The structure includes in-kind creation and redemption, along with staking, allowing investors to earn yield while holding exposure.  This filing puts Grayscale among the first movers in the BNB ETF race, following VanEck, and would make BNB the seventh crypto asset supported by Grayscale’s ETF lineup. While details like fees and seed capital are still undisclosed, the intent is clear. Grayscale is expanding beyond the usual majors and positioning BNB as an institution-ready asset.  From a price perspective, BNB is consolidating just below the $900 resistance. RSI around 44 reflects neutral sentiment, neither overheated nor deeply oversold. MACD remains positive, signaling underlying bullish pressure, though momentum is not yet strong enough to force a clean breakout. Buyers appear patient, not aggressive.  If BNB can reclaim and hold above $900, a move toward the $1,000 region becomes increasingly plausible as sentiment shifts. On the downside, a loss of $850 would weaken the structure and reopen the $800 support zone.  BNB is trading on anticipation rather than hype. As long as price holds its current base, the Grayscale ETF filing adds a quiet but meaningful tailwind to the longer-term outlook.","gravity_id":"373167078","id":105407,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T16:20:25.749Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T17:50:28.202Z"},{"crypto_id":"1839","crypto_name":"BNB","post_time":"2026-01-24T16:29:58.761Z","text_content":"🚀 $BNB  hints at a potential rebound after a sharp pullback.
