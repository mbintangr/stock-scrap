I would look for a potential sweep below the most recent swing low (883.10) to see if liquidity is grabbed, followed by a reversal signal to go long back towards 893.40 or 904.99. - Example long setup: Wait for price to dip below 883.10, then close back above 883.10 on a strong 1h bullish candle or a reversal such as a pin bar. Enter long on confirmation, aiming for 893.40 as the first target and 904.99 as a stretch target. Stop-loss should be placed just below the swing low that formed after the liquidity sweep. - Example short setup: If price pushes up into 893.40-904.99 and shows a clear rejection — for example, a bearish engulfing candle or a reversal pattern on the 15m or 1h — then enter short with a target at 883.10, and if momentum continues, trail towards 875.10 or 864.54.
