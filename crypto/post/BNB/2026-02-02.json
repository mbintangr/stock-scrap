We needed an MMA onchain version, but not just any version of it.   The Fight Foundation team introduced a decentralized MMA ecosystem with an official partnership with the UFC.   So this isn’t just for fans and traders.   It’s for real, professional fighters too.   Many of them struggle with the current win/bonus payment system.   That’s changing, as FIGHT introduces ongoing engagement opportunities that support fighters between events.  Until now, fans had limited access beyond watching live fights. FIGHT changes that by creating direct engagement between fans, fighters, and official partners.   And maybe the most hyped thing to look forward to?   Donald Trump has long been talking about hosting a UFC event at the White House.
