Why it matters for $BTC  and macro traders: these platforms increasingly influence sentiment around elections, rate decisions, and crypto regulation - data that often precedes market moves. 📊 Polymarket leads slightly in liquidity; Kalshi attracts institutional flow.

Therefore, $100,000 will be a decisive moment for BTC.","gravity_id":"371605053","id":3281,"createdAt":"2025-12-04T02:10:04.528Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-04T02:10:04.528Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-04T02:01:49.786Z","text_content":"🚨 🇺🇸Trump Family Linked ABTC Buys $30M Worth Of #Bitcoin  Increasing Total Holdings To 4,367 BTC. $30,000,000 WORTH #BITCOIN DIP BUY 🧡🙌 Powered byBTC#  crypto  $BTC","gravity_id":"371604922","id":3282,"createdAt":"2025-12-04T02:10:04.622Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-04T02:10:04.622Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-04T02:01:11.986Z","text_content":"$BTC  I don't have to look inside of the Black Box and the source code to know what it is doing, right.

We are monitoring the situation for signs of liquidity stabilizing and turning upward at this point.  If this occurs, it would confirm that the bottom is in, remaining above $80,500.

It might even try for 99K, but that area is still strong resistance and hard to break.\n\nThe main level to watch is 88K.

However, analysis of lower timeframes reveals a concerning lack of conviction behind the move, characterized by declining volume and stalling momentum indicators. This creates a mixed environment where the bullish trend is intact but vulnerable, guiding a highly selective approach to seeking trades in other assets.\r \r  Details\r \r Daily: \r Price Action: Bitcoin formed a small bullish candle, decisively closing above the key prior high of $93,959. This shifts the immediate market structure to bullish. The next significant resistance is the EMA50 around $98,493.\r Key Level: The $95,000 area is noted as important psychological and technical resistance.\r Momentum: The Daily MACD continues its bullish expansion with rising histograms, supporting the trend.\r Volume & Context: Volume was slightly higher than the previous large bullish day. It is critical to note that the weekly trend remains technically bearish, providing an important counter-trend context.\r \r  4H: \r Price Action: The rally extended in early trading but is now showing signs of slowing as price approaches the 4H EMA200.\r Momentum Divergence: A key observation is that while price made a higher high, the 4H MACD shows its lines converging and its histogram sequence declining. This is a classic bearish divergence setup, indicating that buying momentum is waning even as price rises.\r Volume: The breakout and follow-up lacked significant volume expansion, questioning the strength of buyer commitment.\r \r  1H: \r Trend Structure: Moving averages maintain a bullish alignment, with price above the EMA9.\r Market State: Price action has entered a phase of low-volatility, high-level consolidation. Volume is flat, and no strong directional impulse is present.","gravity_id":"371606570","id":3413,"createdAt":"2025-12-04T03:50:03.841Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-04T04:00:04.814Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-04T03:42:00.077Z","text_content":"🔥 NOW: Grayscale’s latest research challenges the usual four-year cycle theory they’re expecting $BTC  to break out to new all-time highs in 2026, rather than following past patterns.\r \r \r A fresh perspective as the market matures and dynamics shift.\r \r ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"371605647","id":3414,"createdAt":"2025-12-04T03:50:03.894Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-04T03:50:03.894Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-04T03:40:10.450Z","text_content":"$BTC massive resistance at 94K hope we can restest","gravity_id":"371606532","id":3415,"createdAt":"2025-12-04T03:50:03.945Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-04T03:50:03.945Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-04T04:00:00.106Z","text_content":"$BTC You don't hold Bitcoin to get rich.

This unusual divergence signals a different kind of rally.  🔹 Why It Matters: Normally, $BTC   price surges come with higher leverage as traders take aggressive longs. But this time, leverage is declining, meaning risky positions are being reduced. This limits sudden liquidation risks and creates a more stable price move.  🔹 Stronger Support Around $90K: With traders shifting to safer, more balanced futures positions, the market becomes less fragile and less dependent on borrowed capital. This builds stronger support near $90K, making the current uptrend more resilient and healthier compared to leverage driven rallies. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"371608589","id":3608,"createdAt":"2025-12-04T05:50:05.182Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-04T05:50:05.182Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-04T05:48:49.216Z","text_content":"$BTC  Get your bags filled.

An irresistible curiosity in whatever they do.\n\nThis curiosity asks questions, pushes them into new experiences, and also rewards them with unexpected opportunities.\n\nThe opposite of that is betting with your life on a set path that was handed to you by others.\n\nBe born, do what others say, study hard, graduate, marry, have children, work from 9 to 5, retire, travel, die.\n\nHumans are inherently social and peer pressure is a real thing. It forces many to comply with whatever system they are born into so they can fit in. However, that path makes you invisible.\n\nIf you follow a set path, one that was handed to you by others, you may emerge later in life with a deep sense of frustration, or worst, a feeling of being disempowered and expecting others to rescue you (like say the government).\n\nA curious person pursuing their interests will inevitably set their life on a different trajectory, one that will certainly not make them invisible, at least not to the people that share their interests.\n\nThis point is critical.\n\nYou need to stand out in some form to break away from the \"being invisible\" barrier.\n\nYou can do that in countless ways, but not many choose the unexpected, the unplanned, the uncertain.\n\nYet, that uncertainty is what provides the opportunity to become visible.\n\nWhen I first bought Bitcoin at $700 I was acting on a curiosity. There was no certainty of outcome, but it definitely put me in a very tiny minority. \n\nThat has changed today, but anyone acting on that impulse a decade ago has definitely changed the original path that was already set for them.\n\nEven today, holding any amount of Bitcoin places you in a very exclusive and privileged group. You are definitely not invisible in that sense. You are quite unique among 8 billion people.\n\nThis uniqueness makes your path in life stand out from the average. That also brings opportunities that would not have otherwise been available to you.\n\nBecause of this curiosity, your path in life is no longer set by others, but by yourself and your actions. This is incredibly stimulating and meaningful.\n\nYou no longer wait for others to rescue you, rather you’ve rescued yourself already. This attitude compounds very quickly, similar to how a portfolio compounds faster and faster after 10 years.\n\nNow, the same principle applies to everything in life, including in the choice of a partner or spouse. Are they curious about any particular thing? Do they ask questions?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with an invisible life following a set path handed down by others. However, there is nothing unique or interesting about that.\n\nThe reason Bitcoin hit 126k this year is because it is unique and scarce/rare. By contrast, the price of oil has been in the same range for the past 50 years. Nothing unique or scarce about that.\n\nWhatever the purpose of life may be, one thing is certain. New experiences lead to new data. That allows the creation of a more fulfilling life.\n\nThink of it in AI terms. \n\nAI development needs more and more data, but this data is meaningless if it is the same information duplicated 100 times. If it’s not unique in some form, after a point, it’s useless to further advance an AI.\n\nYou cannot break the invisibility barrier if your daily dose of new experiences is zero. You need a trigger to break the routine or that set path. If you’re at that point in life where you need a trigger, embrace it, don’t avoid it.\n\nIf you don’t do it yourself, life has a way of doing it for you, but in those cases, the experiences that follow may not be the ones you wanted.\n\nStill, even if they are unwanted or unpleasant, embrace those experiences. Because they enable new data critical to your success later.\n\nThis is why some of the most successful people we know failed many times, but every time that happened, they picked themselves up and tried again. \n\nIn fact, they were just acquiring new data/experience until they became successful and… unique.\n\nNo path is the same. \n\nJust dare to walk your path and follow your curiosity, wherever it may lead. Life will take care of the rest.\n\nThat’s how a meaningful life is created. \n\nFor you, not for others. \n\nRemember, you are the one experiencing it, hence be very careful when you accept the opinions of others about how you should live your life. They don’t know your path!\n\nI’ll end with one question. What tingles your curiosity?\n\nIn my case, Bitcoin started a journey spanning over a decade that also spilled into the creation of this X account. I am very grateful for everything I have experienced which enabled my current life.\n\nHit a follow @duonine and share this post if you enjoyed reading this.

That’s real utility life-changing value.”\n\nPeter: “But Bitcoin has no industrial use.”\n\nCZ: “Community, adoption, real-world usage you can’t copy that.

Latest drivers? Spot ETFs saw $58.5M inflows yesterday (5th straight day), signaling renewed institutional appetite despite Nov's 3.5B outflows. BlackRock's Larry Fink just dropped a bombshell: sovereign wealth funds are \"buying more\" BTC, viewing it as a volatility hedge in a leveraged market. On-chain: Miner flows to exchanges up 3.7% (potential selling pressure), but whales & HODLers are distributing – classic consolidation post-rally. Technicals: MACD flipped positive (+787), reclaiming 7-day SMA at $90K. Fear & Greed at 26 (extreme fear) screams oversold bounce. Broader macro: Fed's Dec pivot to cuts could ignite risk-on flows, echoing 2021's \"Christmas rally.\" But liquidity's thin (market depth down to $569M from Oct peak), & Strategy slashed buys to just 135 BTC this month – prepping for bears? My take: Healthy reset in a bull cycle; post-halving momentum intact. Tomorrow (Dec 5): Expect volatility as NFP data looms. Bull case: ETF momentum + Fed hopes push above $93K resistance for $95K test. Bear trap: If miners dump, retest $90K support. Prediction: 60% shot at $94,500 (modest grind up on inflows). 40% downside to $91,000 if data disappoints. Tomorrow's BTC close: $94,500 rally or $91,000 pullback?
