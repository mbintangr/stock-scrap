While selling volume was not extreme, the subsequent bounce lacks any significant buying pressure, trapping price in a weak consolidation range. Momentum indicators across lower timeframes have turned negative, confirming the shift from a rebound attempt back to a cautious, range-bound market posture.\r \r  Details\r \r Daily: \r Price Action: A bearish daily candle erased nearly all gains from the prior two-day rebound, closing below the EMA9. Volume on the down day was lower than on the preceding up days.\r Key Levels: Immediate support is being tested near $88,000, with resistance now at the $90,000-$91,000 zone.\r Momentum: The Daily MACD, while still bullish, shows a critical development: its histogram has declined for the first time in the recent sequence, and the lines have marginally converged. This is the first clear signal of waning daily upside momentum.\r \r \r  4H: \r Price Action: A sustained decline found a low at $88,040 before a feeble bounce. The EMA9 has crossed below the EMA21 and is converging with the EMA50, threatening further bearish alignment.\r Momentum: The 4H MACD lines are bearish and diverging, with the fast line now below zero. The histogram shows rising red bars, confirming selling momentum. Rallies occur on progressively declining volume.\r \r \r  1H: \r Price Action: A sharp, higher-volume sell-off was followed by a low-volume, low-volatility bounce that is struggling near the EMA9.\r Structure: The EMA9 and EMA21 have both crossed below the EMA200, forming a bearish “death cross” pattern on this timeframe.\r Momentum Paradox: The 1H MACD has formed a bullish cross, but it is characterized by small lines and weak histogram growth, perfectly reflecting the anemic, unconvincing nature of the price bounce.","gravity_id":"371681228","id":7559,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T05:20:04.581Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T05:20:04.581Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-06T05:11:14.817Z","text_content":"$BTC  We may see a MASSIVE transfer of wealth in the not so distant future from the current holders to the most patient hands in the market.   #BTC Correction Incoming?#","gravity_id":"371682132","id":7560,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T05:20:04.744Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T05:20:04.744Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-06T05:30:00.121Z","text_content":"$BTC Fiat punishes questions.

Unlike a standard support zone, a CSR is defined by context, behaviour, and higher-timeframe significance.\n\n\nA CSR typically forms when:\n\n\n1️⃣ Price reaches the deepest point of a downtrend and sellers show exhaustion\n– Volume fades\n– Momentum weakens\n– Candles lose follow-through\n\n\n2️⃣ Buyers create the first meaningful counter-move of the trend\nA CSR is confirmed only when structure breaks—such as a higher low, higher high, or strong bullish impulse.\n\n\n3️⃣ The zone aligns with HTF confluences\nThese often include demand clusters, wedge-support intersections, HTF fib levels, previous accumulation ranges, or liquidity pivots.\n\n\n⸻\n\n\nWhy CSRs Matter\n\n\nA CSR is the point where the market effectively says:\n“Sellers are losing control; buyers are stepping in.”\n\n\nCSRs offer:\n\n\n✔ High-probability accumulation zones\n✔ Early signals of macro reversals\n✔ Strong entries for swing setups\n✔ Clear invalidation if the zone fails\n\n\nA successful CSR often transitions price from controlled descent into accelerated expansion.
