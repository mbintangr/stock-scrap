CZ just tore apart Peter Schiff’s whole stance in less than half a minute. No fluff, just straight logic. It’s a great example of why digital assets keep dominating the conversation.  What really hit me was the way CZ cut right to the heart of things. Gold fans always talk about its “historic value,” but they skip over the stuff that matters now, speed, how easy it is to move, break up, and use anywhere. Bitcoin isn’t here to erase the past. It’s building what’s next. Markets don’t care about nostalgia; they care about what works.  Here’s the real takeaway: You don’t have to love crypto, but you can’t ignore where things are headed. Every new wave moves faster, gets adopted sooner, and wipes out old ideas that can’t keep up.  If you still think this whole thing is about ideology, you’re missing the point. It’s about numbers, incentives, tech, and how value actually moves in today’s world.  $BTC  #BTC  #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"371696619","id":8832,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T19:10:04.183Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T19:10:04.183Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-06T19:09:35.207Z","text_content":"Whale Alert: #Hyperliquid  Whale (0x1369)  Long  BTC with 10x leverage, entry price $89428.3, position value $2.52M.

If it stumbles, the stock market collapses like a house of cards. Massive ETF outflows will trigger forced asset sales, a liquidity crisis, and a domino effect of defaults. S&P 500 could crash 30–40% in a month, while crypto—always more volatile—will plunge even harder. Bitcoin? $20K or lower.  Oracle is a ticking time bomb in tech. With $100B in debt, soaring CDS spreads, and heavy AI exposure, it’s vulnerable. If Oracle defaults:  Nasdaq tanks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Google—all AI-linked—will collapse). Corporate bonds implode (yields spike, prices crash, defaults surge). Banks crumble (Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs hold Oracle’s debt). Result? Nasdaq drops 40–50%, Bitcoin plunges to $15–18K, and altcoins get wiped out (80–90% losses).  AI Bubble Bursts—Everything Collapses Both firms bet big on AI:  BlackRock poured billions into AI startups. Oracle burns cash on cloud/AI infrastructure—but where’s the profit? When investors realize AI isn’t the goldmine they hoped for, mass exodus from tech begins. Impact:  Stocks: -50% or worse. Crypto: Bitcoin at $15–18K, alts -80–90%. Liquidity crisis: The Fed prints again—but it won’t help.  What to Do?  Close long positions in BlackRock, Oracle, and tech stocks. Buy puts on Nasdaq & S&P 500. Hedge into stablecoins or gold—when panic hits, the dollar may spike briefly, but not for long. Prepare for defaults—corporate bonds turn toxic. BlackRock and Oracle aren’t just companies—they’re systemic risks. Their collapse destroys stocks AND crypto.

Proposed penalties may include fines based on annual revenue, raising the stakes for compliance and security.

Except for 2013, 2017 & 2020 it's pretty slow overall.  Funnily enough, the extra day from the leap years generally sees a good return, never noticed that before.  All in all I wouldn't expect any major moves to occur until the new year. Generally the end and start of the year are pretty choppy. Especially around Christmas when liquidity and volumes are just very low overall.","gravity_id":"371716044","id":9828,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T10:20:04.850Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T10:20:04.850Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-07T10:28:23.439Z","text_content":"$BTC  Weekly Chart\r \r #BTC   #ETH","gravity_id":"371715128","id":9834,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T10:30:04.137Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T10:30:04.137Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-07T10:26:00.141Z","text_content":"$BTC every fiat bailout is proof that bitcoin was right again","gravity_id":"371715117","id":9835,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T10:30:04.272Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T10:30:04.272Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-07T10:25:45.248Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nParadigm Co-founder: This is Cryptocurrency's \"Netscape Moment\" or \"iPhone Moment\"\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"371716117","id":9836,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T10:30:04.409Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T10:30:04.409Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-07T10:25:45.117Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nAnalyst: #Bitcoin 'Activity' Metric Rising, Signaling Bull Market Extension\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"371715113","id":9837,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T10:30:04.545Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T10:30:04.545Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-07T10:25:45.103Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nPolymarket predicts a 33% chance of \"#Bitcoin Reaching $100,000 Again This Year.\"\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"371712763","id":9838,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T10:30:04.691Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T10:30:04.691Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-07T10:25:45.099Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nParadigm Co-founder: We Are Currently Experiencing the Cryptocurrency Industry's 'Netscape or iPhone Moment'\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"371716112","id":9839,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T10:30:04.795Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T10:30:04.795Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-07T10:24:09.992Z","text_content":"$BTC 100k WE COMING","gravity_id":"371716107","id":9841,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T10:30:04.960Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T10:30:04.960Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-07T10:22:41.987Z","text_content":"Whale Alert: #Hyperliquid  Whale (0x699a)  Short  BTC with 28x leverage, entry price $89145.8, position value $3.49M.

However, this signal occurs amidst critically low volume and across a backdrop of weakening momentum and bearish alignments on lower timeframes. The market remains in a fragile state, and any bullish reversal requires strong confirmation.  Details Daily:  Price Action: Within this pullback, the daily candle formed with a long lower shadow and a small real body near the high, giving it a hammer-like appearance. This suggests buying interest emerged at a specific support level during the session. Key Interpretation: However, within a corrective phase, this pattern does not carry the same strong reversal implication it would at the end of a prolonged downtrend. Its primary significance is that it marks a level where sellers paused and buyers responded, forming a potential support zone that must now be defended. Confirmation: The subsequent price action is critical. A close above this candle's high would strengthen the support case, while a break below its low would invalidate it and suggest a deeper correction.  4H:  Trend Structure: Price continues to trade below the EMA9. A bearish death cross has formed (EMA9 and EMA21 below EMA200), though the moving averages are flat and close together, indicating a lack of strong directional momentum. Momentum: MACD remains below zero with lines diverging bearishly. The declining red histogram indicates that the pace of the downtrend is slowing, but the trend itself is still down.  1H:  Price Action: A minor bounce from lows is characterized by extremely low volume and low volatility, showing no conviction from buyers. Momentum: MACD has made a bullish cross and is approaching the zero line, but the lines are nearly parallel and lack strong separation. The histogram is choppy.

Analyst Darkfost points out that November’s spot trading volume has dropped to $246B, far below the $333B peak in March 2024 and even lower than last October’s $198B. Each cycle peak is declining — a clear sign that spot demand is fading while conviction weakens at a critical stage. On top of that, the spot-to-futures ratio has plunged to 0.23, meaning over 75% of all $BTC  activity is now driven by short-term futures speculation.  With Bitcoin hovering around $89,300, the market is active but enthusiasm is shifting in the wrong direction. Reduced spot participation typically signals caution and can suppress strong upside momentum until real buyers step back in. The next big move will depend on when — and if — spot demand returns.

While the market remains active, traders are leaning heavily toward speculation rather than real buying  a sign of uncertainty and short-term volatility dominating the current cycle. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371719933","id":10517,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T16:50:04.034Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T17:00:05.417Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-07T16:48:41.615Z","text_content":"🚨 Attention Altcoin Holders: The DCA Window Is Opening  Altcoins have struggled this cycle, making selective exposure more important than ever.
