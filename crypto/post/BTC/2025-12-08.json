In a turn of events that has left economists baffled and slightly irritated, it appears the recent inexplicable rise in market prices is entirely due to a coordinated effort by the entire population of Somalia.  Sources on Wall Street claim the sudden market dip was a meticulously planned \"Somali Fire Sale,\" specifically designed to allow them to \"buy low\" before a massive upswing. “It’s brilliant, really,” said a fictional market analyst. “They’re leveraging global political uncertainty to corner the avocado market and invest heavily in companies that produce comfortable sandals.”  The rumour mill suggests that following a certain ambiguous statement made by a semi-prominent political figure—let's call him 'Mr. Grump'—the entire nation decided to voluntarily deregister themselves from their home country and emigrate en masse, using their newly acquired stock profits to secure first-class tickets.  This sudden influx of market power has not only stabilized the economy but caused a massive demand for winter coats in tropical regions.

While the daily chart shows a loss of downward momentum near support, the higher-timeframe weekly trend remains firmly bearish. This contradiction has resulted in chaotic, low-conviction intraday price swings, characterized by sharp reversals and a lack of sustained volume. The market is in a consolidation phase that favors neither bulls nor bears until a clear breakout occurs.\r \r  Weekly: \r The overarching trend is bearish, confirmed by a recent death cross (EMA9 < EMA50). This week's long-legged bearish candle (or doji) found support but failed to rally, indicating selling pressure persists at higher levels. The weekly MACD remains in a bearish configuration, adding to the downward bias.\r \r  Daily: \r Price Action: The daily candle is a doji with a prominent lower shadow, closing below the EMA9. This indicates a temporary balance between buyers and sellers after a dip, but not a reversal signal.\r Key Levels: Immediate resistance is the EMA21 (~$91,479), while the EMA9 (~$90,188) acts as nearby resistance-turned-support. A sustained break above $91.5k is needed to shift the short-term bias.\r Momentum: The Daily MACD presents a concerning bearish divergence: while the lines are still separated, the histogram is sequentially declining, indicating waning upward momentum despite the sideways price action.\r \r  4H & 1H: \r Price Action: Both the 4-hour and 1-hour charts exhibited sharp, high-volatility moves that were completely retraced within a few candles. The 1-hour chart, in particular, showed a complex pattern of breaking below a range, rallying above it, and then collapsing back into it—a sign of a market trapped in a low-liquidity, high-noise environment.","gravity_id":"371731057","id":11238,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T00:00:04.382Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T00:00:04.382Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-07T23:58:45.123Z","text_content":"Individuals still own almost 66% of the total $BTC supply!

Can It Be Truly Profitable?  Creating a cryptocurrency requires investment, and if the project succeeds early on, the owner expects returns. But how does a typical crypto creator behave behind the scenes?  It usually begins with generating FOMO—the fear of missing out. The owner pushes the price upward, creating hype and attracting investors. Once the price reaches the peak, the owner locks in the liquidity, trapping investors who bought at the top.  With investors stuck, the owner begins creating new liquidity points during the downtrend, because these zones are essential for the owner to continue selling. Eventually, the owner establishes the bottom, since they need to accumulate at the lowest price possible.  After accumulating, the owner orchestrates a rally from the bottom back to the main liquidity resistance. This ensures that no investor “misses” the upward movement. When buyers rush into these liquidity levels, the owner sells again.  If the chart breaks upward, whales and large investors replace the trapped earlier holders. Some of them exit at breakeven; others leave with small profits.  Then comes the silent phase: while investors try to predict the next top, the owners discreetly sell without raising suspicion. They push the price slowly down toward the next liquidity support zone below. Fear takes over, causing small investors to panic-sell at low prices, which creates new liquidity for the owner.  After that, the chart collapses again, trapping both the buyers at the top and those who bought into liquidity zones. The owner eventually returns to the accumulation area at the bottom—the same zone they defined from the start............If you want to see part 2 of this story, it will be in the comment below, remembering that this is a story.","gravity_id":"371733797","id":11656,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T05:30:05.972Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T05:30:05.972Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T05:40:00.125Z","text_content":"$BTC fiat disguises weakness as flexibility. bitcoin disguises nothing","gravity_id":"371734847","id":11665,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T05:40:04.160Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T05:40:04.160Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T05:39:15.528Z","text_content":"🚨 Google searches for “dollar debasement” just hit an all-time high this quarter showing a growing public concern around currency value and inflation.

And it’s only just starting.   ﻿$COMMON  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371738750","id":12015,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T09:00:08.730Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T09:00:08.730Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T08:57:38.932Z","text_content":"$BTC  we follow data, and even if the data stay uptrend until 140K we will keep uptrend, no hope 100% data","gravity_id":"371738745","id":12016,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T09:00:08.819Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T09:00:08.819Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T08:57:22.446Z","text_content":"🤣 BITCOIN JUST RESPECTED THE 52-WEEK LOW LIKE IT OWES IT RENT Every.

That drop wasn’t just market movement — it reflected real capital outflow from the ETF.  Looking at November’s pattern, the picture becomes clearer:  The largest daily outflow was smaller than the extreme spikes in Q1 2025  But the frequency and density of redemptions were more intense  And the overall scale of November outflows was even heavier  At the same time, trading volume in the ETF surged. High volume + consistent outflows = strong downward momentum that added pressure to Bitcoin during the correction.  👉 In short: IBIT wasn’t just reacting to the market — it was accelerating the sell pressure.  And this is exactly why many traders moved back to BingX, where they could: ✔️ Track ETF flow data in real time ✔️ React faster than legacy platforms ✔️ Long/short BTC with flexible leverage ✔️ Catch volatility instead of being trapped by it  When big ETFs move slow, smart money moves on BingX. If this outflow trend continues, December could be even more volatile — and volatility is opportunity for those prepared.

Despite the arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs, these shares remain a significant tool for investors seeking crypto access without directly holding BTC.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"371740936","id":12282,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T11:10:06.521Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T11:10:06.521Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T11:06:50.403Z","text_content":"$BTC Bitcoin just broke $92,000 🚀","gravity_id":"371741035","id":12283,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T11:10:06.716Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T11:10:06.716Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T11:06:30.085Z","text_content":"$BTC    Please Brother 1 bitcoin gift me I Am From Bangladesh  My Trust wallet Bitcoin  Address :  bc1qe79kr88zn7ph6tarptmy458qt03f8gg642tx8e","gravity_id":"371741032","id":12284,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T11:10:06.818Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T11:10:06.818Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T11:05:07.284Z","text_content":"Bitcoin just broke $92,000 🚀 $BTC","gravity_id":"371744364","id":12285,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T11:10:07.007Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T11:10:07.007Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T11:04:45.065Z","text_content":"Peter Schiff and CZ Clash In High-Profile Gold vs Bitcoin Showdown $BTC https://zycrypto.com/peter-schiff-and-cz-clash-in-high-profile-gold-vs-bitcoin-showdown/ via @ZyCrypto","gravity_id":"371743367","id":12286,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T11:10:07.349Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T11:10:07.349Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T11:04:45.061Z","text_content":"Tom Lee Predicts A New Bitcoin High Before The End Of January 2026 $BTC https://zycrypto.com/tom-lee-predicts-a-new-bitcoin-high-before-the-end-of-january-2026/ via @ZyCrypto","gravity_id":"371740923","id":12288,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T11:10:07.629Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T11:10:07.629Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T11:16:45.077Z","text_content":"Introducing our final CryptoIQ contestant 🔥\n\nFrom earning bitcoin in 2014 through Coinbase ref-links, to creating the first @AxieInfinity scholarship program, @0xak_ has been around the block 🧠\n\nHis plan for the prize?\n\nStraight into @HyperliquidX & max long BTC 🤑 ","gravity_id":"371743435","id":12299,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T11:20:04.596Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T11:20:04.596Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T11:16:45.069Z","text_content":"Bitcoin traders are on high alert this week as several major market forces converge.

After weeks of indecision, this resurgence in activity indicates rising conviction - but Bitcoin’s chart shows the market is entering a high-risk, high-reward zone rather than confirming a trend shift.  BTC is stabilizing near $92,000 after rebounding from the $83,000 lower Bollinger Band. The price is now testing the 20-day MA and the middle band - both converging as resistance. Momentum is improving, with RSI recovering toward 50, but buyers haven’t secured control. A clean break above $94,000–$95,000 could trigger upside toward $100,600, and potentially $110,000–$123,000 if follow-through demand persists.  However, volume alone doesn’t guarantee direction. Previous spikes near resistance were driven by short-term leverage and quickly unwound. A failure to maintain levels above $92,000 raises the risk of a retracement toward $86,800, with the $82,900–$83,000 zone acting as final structural support.  The next move matters: if volume remains elevated and BTC holds above resistance, momentum can flip decisively bullish. If not, the market may be preparing for another volatility-driven shakeout. In the current environment, precision and patience are strategic advantages. 📊💡  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"371743660","id":12392,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T12:00:04.815Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T12:00:04.815Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T11:57:40.162Z","text_content":"$BTC went up to $92k today, and now it's at $91k, from here it could go both ways, either up or down..\n\nThat triggers me to ask, why won't you trade stocks, knowing you specifically could trade tokenized Stocks on Bitget with 0% fees.. \n\nI've ran a comparison, on all US stock trading platforms, & Bitget charges no fees for trading & selling onchain stocks..\n\nEver since my investment on  $ZEC took an unexpected turn downhill, I've been trading stocks, and now I'm excited to see Zec begining to rise from the ashes..\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #BTC #ZEC #CMC","gravity_id":"371744653","id":12393,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T12:00:04.972Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T12:00:04.972Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T11:56:44.606Z","text_content":"BREAKING 💥: $BTC has surged backed to $92,000.","gravity_id":"371741309","id":12394,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T12:00:05.133Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T12:00:05.133Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T11:56:25.235Z","text_content":"$BTC  is trading around $91.3K after bouncing from its $88K low, showing cautious confidence despite sharp volatility and uncertainty.

This move, when highlighted by #Bitcoin  Magazine and Reuters, triggered market speculation about whether the company might eventually sell a portion of its substantial $BTC   holdings if financial conditions tighten.  Adding to the discussion, the company’s CEO has publicly acknowledged that there are scenarios in which selling BTC becomes a rational option. As reported by Investopedia, if Strategy’s market-to-net-asset-value (mNAV) were to fall below 1 and the company found itself without access to alternative capital, a partial liquidation of its Bitcoin reserves could be justified as a strategic response.  However, despite these theoretical scenarios, Investopedia also reports that Strategy has not sold a single Bitcoin since it started accumulating BTC back in 2020. This long-standing commitment reinforces the company’s image as one of the strongest corporate advocates for Bitcoin.  For now, all public data indicate that Strategy remains in accumulation mode, not liquidation mode. The company’s actions continue to align with its long-term pro-Bitcoin strategy, even as it prepares financially for multiple potential market outcomes.","gravity_id":"371741426","id":12438,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T12:20:04.737Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T12:30:04.636Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T12:13:45.117Z","text_content":"Harvard Triples Its Bitcoin Investment, Now Allocating 2:1 BTC Over Gold #Bitcoin #BitcoinETF #BTC #Harvard \nhttps://www.crypto-news-flash.com/harvard-triples-its-bitcoin-investment/?fsp_sid=3139 ","gravity_id":"371743751","id":12439,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T12:20:04.883Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T12:30:04.781Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T12:13:45.117Z","text_content":"Michael Saylor Bitcoin Outreach Reaches Middle East Funds \n-   https://coinfomania.com/michael-saylor-bitcoin-outreach-reaches-middle-east-funds/ ","gravity_id":"371742309","id":12440,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T12:20:05.038Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T12:30:04.896Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T12:13:45.116Z","text_content":"A Former Bitcoin Supporter Sold His BTC and Invested All His Money in This Altcoin!

The Fed is no longer reducing its balance sheet.\n\n- Starting now, all maturing agency MBS principal (~$15–25B/month recently) will be reinvested into Treasury securities (mostly T-bills).\n\n- Maturing Treasuries will be fully rolled over instead of capped at $5B/month.\n\n- Combined, this implies ~$20–30B/month of gross Treasury additions in the near term — not new QE, just replacing runoff and offsetting growth in currency + other liabilities.\n\n- Fed officials have explicitly said they may buy additional T-bills if reserves fall below “ample” levels (current target zone appears \n\n~8–11% of GDP). No fixed $45B/month figure has been announced or confirmed by the Fed.\nRate Path\n- Markets are pricing an 85%+ chance of a 25 bps cut at the December 9–10 FOMC meeting (taking fed funds to 3.75–4.00%).\n- Powell & Co. continue to emphasize the dual mandate: maximum employment + 2% inflation.\n\nCrypto Takeaway\nBitcoin is trading ~$91,300 today. The combination of:\n\n- No more QT drain\n- Likely December rate cut\n- Stabilizing/gradually rising reserves\n\n…is unambiguously positive for risk assets and liquidity-sensitive markets like crypto.\n\nThis isn’t 2020-style “unlimited QE,” but it does remove a major headwind and adds a mild tailwind — exactly the kind of environment that has historically fueled the next leg up in BTC and alts.\n\n\nDo you think this marks the start of the next big crypto leg higher?  \nYES or NO? 🚀\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#\n\n$BTC","gravity_id":"371742353","id":12450,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T12:30:03.984Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T12:40:04.743Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T12:19:45.096Z","text_content":"Ruya Bank CEO: Bitcoin Is Now Shari’ah Compliant — A New Chapter for Islamic Digital Finance https://www.unlock-bc.com/153015/bitcoin-shariah-compliant-ruya-bank-uae/ via @unlockbc @myruyabank #islamicFinance #isBitcoinHalal #Shariah_compliant #Bitcoin #adoption #BitcoinNews #UAE","gravity_id":"371744787","id":12451,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T12:30:04.076Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T12:40:04.867Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T12:19:45.055Z","text_content":"LATEST: 🪙 Two physical Casascius coins holding 1,000 Bitcoin each were activated after being dormant for over 13 years, moving a combined $180 million worth of BTC that was minted when it traded between $3.88 and $11.69.

The Numbers: Strategy purchased #BTC  at an average price of $90,615, bringing total holdings to 660,624 BTC with a cost basis of $74,696.

And PCIDSS V4.0.1 to make sure every fiat and card transaction is handled under strict protocols.\n\nWhen you’re holding assets like BTC, this level of security actually matters.\nA lot of platforms talk but BingX is one of the few putting real structure behind their words.\n\nThis is the kind of foundation that makes trading feel safe, not risky. #Bitcoin #BTC #BingXMilestone","gravity_id":"371748886","id":12860,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T16:00:10.491Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T16:00:10.491Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T15:58:57.689Z","text_content":"$BTC BEARISH ALL THE WAY","gravity_id":"371748885","id":12861,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T16:00:11.796Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T16:00:11.796Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T15:57:38.408Z","text_content":"🪙 Altcoin Season Breathes Lightly As Canton, Ethena And Ondo Rise In A Cautious Market    #Altcoin  season shows slight #improvement  as Canton, Ethena and Ondo rise while fear eases and #Bitcoin  stabilizes above $90,000.
