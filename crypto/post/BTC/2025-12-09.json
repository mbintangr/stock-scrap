During U.S. debt-ceiling fights, the Treasury spends from the TGA - and that fresh money usually lifts markets, including Bitcoin.  In 2025, liquidity tightened and pushed $BTC  down toward $80K. But Hayes thinks that phase is over: • QT has stopped • Treasury stress is easing • the TGA is nearly refilled • banks are lending again  His view: liquidity has bottomed - and that’s when Bitcoin tends to turn up.  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"371756044","id":13260,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T19:30:48.669Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T19:30:48.669Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T19:21:00.057Z","text_content":"$TURBO  memecoin momentum - sustainable?

Japan’s bond yields just hit 2.94% - the highest since 1998 - and that’s a problem for $BTC . When yields spike, Japanese money tends to move back home, and that can pressure U.S. bonds, Tether, and crypto.  Japan holds over $1.1T in U.S. Treasuries, and rising local yields make them less attractive. If investors start shifting capital back to Japan, global liquidity tightens and risky assets usually feel it.  We’ve seen this before - BOJ policy shifts have triggered sharp Bitcoin drops in the past. If yields stay near 2.9%, analysts warn BTC could slide toward $87K, though ETF inflows may soften the hit.  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"371754685","id":13324,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T20:10:08.781Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T20:10:08.781Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T20:03:13.072Z","text_content":"$BTC   Top 6 whale in the BTC world + Tether adding DCA amounts BTC since NOV until now, what means a signal for new cycle enterin","gravity_id":"371756258","id":13325,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T20:10:08.888Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T20:10:08.888Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T20:01:45.052Z","text_content":"Bitcoin Liquidity Signal: What It Means for the Market\nhttps://bpaynews.com/bitcoin-liquidity-signal-what-it-means-for-the-market/","gravity_id":"371753688","id":13326,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T20:10:09.061Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T20:10:09.061Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T20:20:00.139Z","text_content":"$BTC bitcoin is the only market where truth can't be faked","gravity_id":"371753767","id":13337,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T20:20:07.765Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T20:30:06.866Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T20:16:28.702Z","text_content":"Harvard isn’t playing small anymore  they just made a statement loud enough for Wall Street to hear.

This ratio is one of the most crucial macro tools for understanding the true value of Bitcoin versus Gold.\n\n1. Price Action and Cyclical Peaks (BTC/GOLD)\nThe chart clearly shows that Bitcoin's value relative to Gold has formed three major cyclical peaks:\n * 1st Cycle Peak (2013-2014):\n   * The first ATH (All-Time High) peak was observed.\n   * Peak value: \\text{BTC/Gold} \\approx 1. This means that one Bitcoin was roughly equal to one ounce of gold at that time. This is the historical record of the moment Bitcoin first achieved parity with Gold.\n * 2nd Cycle Peak (2017-2018):\n   * The second ATH peak.\n   * Peak value: \\text{BTC/Gold} \\approx 15. Bitcoin increased its value by 15 times against Gold in this cycle.\n * 3rd Cycle Peak (2021-2022):\n   * The third ATH peak.\n   * Peak value: \\text{BTC/Gold} \\approx 40. This signifies that Bitcoin's value against Gold increased to 40 times. This ratio is tangible proof of how quickly Bitcoin surpassed Gold as a store of value on a macro level.\n\n2. Projected Cycle and Channel Structure\nThe price action in the chart forms a significant triangle and rising channel structure:\n * Ascending Lows/Bases: The low points following the correction after each cycle peak are consistently higher. This indicates that Bitcoin's minimum value against Gold is increasing even during bear markets.\n * Upper Boundary (Channel/Band): The price typically touches the upper boundary of the 20-period Moving Average Band to form peaks. This band (light blue area) indicates Bitcoin's relative momentum against Gold. As long as the price remains above this band, the relative strength continues.\n\n3. Lower Indicator: RSI (Relative Strength Index)\nThe indicator at the bottom is the RSI (Relative Strength Index) oscillator. In the 2-week timeframe, the RSI shows overbought (70 and above) and oversold (30 and below) zones.\n * Peak Confirmation: During the previous major \\text{ATH} peaks (2014, 2018, 2021), we see that the RSI generally entered overbought conditions by climbing above the 75level. This indicates the psychological euphoria required for a peak formation.\n\n * Current Situation (End of 2025): Currently, the RSI is neither in the overbought nor oversold zone, hovering around the center (approximately 50-60 levels). This may mean that the asset is re-accumulating energy against Gold and preparing for the next cyclical rally. Historically, falling below the 30.00 level has offered a long-term accumulation/buying opportunity \n\nConclusion and Future Projection\nThis macro chart clearly shows that the increase in Bitcoin's value against Gold follows an exponential growth model:\n * Cyclical Multiplication: The rate of increase between the peaks (1 \\to 15 \\to 40) shows that the power against Gold is multiplying with each new cycle.\n\n * 4th Cycle Target: If this exponential growth and technical structure continue, the next major bull cycle has the potential to easily push the \\text{BTC/Gold} ratio towards the 100 level. The move from 40 to 100 represents a proportional growth (approximately 2.5 times) similar to the previous cycle's increase.\n\n * Macro Retracement: The price has undergone a healthy retracement after the 2021 peak, but it has still managed to stay well above the 2018 peak levels (around 15). This is the strongest macro evidence that old resistance has become new support.","gravity_id":"371754790","id":13354,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T20:30:05.760Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T20:40:09.633Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T20:25:32.861Z","text_content":"$BTC\nThis market is just about as cooked as ZEC","gravity_id":"371756356","id":13355,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T20:30:05.944Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T20:40:09.843Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T20:25:21.824Z","text_content":"📈 Last week, seven public companies increased their Bitcoin holdings, collectively adding 11,260.51 BTC (1.02B)   \r \r \r #BTCD  #BTC  #Bitcoin2025  $BTC","gravity_id":"371756354","id":13356,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T20:30:06.128Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T20:30:06.128Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T20:25:19.431Z","text_content":"$BTC is in a decision zone bulls need to reclaim 91K and flip it into support no excuses.

That, to him, flipped the script - turning 2024 into a year of “political repricing,” not a true bull market.  And 2025?

The situation erupted when traders noticed a sudden surge of aggressive $BTC  -long positions on Polymarket shortly before rumors of a large institutional purchase began circulating. While no direct evidence of insider access has been confirmed, the timing has sparked heated discussion across X and broader web3 circles.  Top analysts argue this could represent a structural flaw in prediction markets. Some DeFi researchers warn that if participants can leverage private institutional flows before they’re public, Polymarket could become a tool for amplifying insider advantages rather than leveling the playing field. Others, including prominent quant traders, counter that prediction markets simply reward speed, intelligence, and superior data not insider information and that markets have always priced in signals before retail catches on. Ethereum thought leaders frame this as an “oracle design issue,” suggesting that Polymarket may need better guardrails around sources and timing of sensitive information.  Meanwhile, $BTC   maximalists view the incident as proof that markets now respond instantly to major buy signals, reinforcing BTC’s position as the world’s most reflexive macro asset. Retail traders, however, are calling it “another example of whales eating early,” arguing that prediction markets risk losing legitimacy if high-stakes participants can exploit opaque institutional flows.  Whether this was genuine insight or unfair edge remains unresolved but the debate has already pushed prediction-market integrity to the forefront of the crypto narrative.","gravity_id":"371755666","id":13415,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T21:10:05.027Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T21:10:05.027Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T21:08:29.077Z","text_content":"$BTC  All the data predict that metaplanet can come any time out - even next 24H with the new orders BTC.

Right now Bitcoin is trading around $91,000, and the short term battle is all about whether buyers can keep price above this zone. As long as BTC stays above $90,300, the bullish structure remains stable and we can still look for another leg up.  If momentum returns, the upside path opens toward $94,000, then $97,000, and eventually the $105,000 to $106,000 region. But if BTC loses $90,300 again, we could revisit deeper levels quickly and the door toward $80,000 and eventually the major demand at $74,000 to $78,500 comes back into play.

This is even more true on prediction markets - the market is smaller, blockchain-based, and relatively anonymous, which gives insiders free rein.  When a platform leaks signals that a $1B $BTC  buy is coming and traders jump in early, it’s hard not to wonder if some people are playing with information the rest of the market never gets. Watching the charts, the reaction looked way too clean: quick spike, aggressive long positioning, and no hesitation. That’s not retail behavior; that’s coordinated confidence. And whenever you see that, you have to question whether the edge came from skill… or from knowing something before everyone else.  But calling it “insider trading” in crypto is tricky, because we’re still operating in a space with loose rules and weak guardrails. This might just expose a flaw in how prediction markets handle sensitive flows. If traders can infer major orders from open liquidity or internal data patterns, that’s a structural weakness not a coincidence.   Either way, it’s a wake-up call: in a market this young, information is still the strongest weapon, and the people with the earliest signals will always shape the chart before the rest of us even refresh the page.  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"371758212","id":13505,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T22:00:16.557Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T22:00:16.557Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T21:55:54.166Z","text_content":"I'm bearish on $BTC","gravity_id":"371756782","id":13506,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T22:00:16.735Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T22:00:16.735Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T21:53:38.454Z","text_content":"Within #SocialMining  circles where community analysts examine sentiment reactions to structural shifts, $BTC  continues to be monitored closely as @Bitcoin_CMC   trades inside a congested mid-range zone following a broader corrective phase. Participants emphasize that this region, shaped by repeated liquidity interactions over the past weeks, often determines whether short-term bias leans toward recovery or deeper retracement. The chart shows Bitcoin once again attempting to consolidate above the 90,000 level after multiple failures to reclaim momentum beyond the 103,000–107,400 resistance cluster. This upper region has acted as a decisive distribution block, with sellers repeatedly absorbing attempts to break higher. Until BTC secures a daily close above these levels, upside continuation remains structurally limited. On the downside, the 86,000 band has served as a notable reaction zone. Should Bitcoin lose this support, liquidity pockets extend down toward 80,000 and 75,000, areas highlighted on the chart as deeper demand layers where previous trend shifts occurred. A clean break below these thresholds could accelerate the corrective cycle, especially during periods of elevated macro uncertainty. Conversely, sustained stability above 90,000 may give $BTC  room to reattempt a move toward the 95,000–100,000 region, ultimately retesting structural pressure points near 103,000. Traders are watching for volume expansion and shifts in market participation to determine whether buyers can regain control of momentum. As sentiment across Social Mining communities reflects increased caution, the focus remains on tracking liquidity behavior, volatility compression, and how news flow influences directional bias. While long-term structure remains intact, the immediate outlook hinges on whether Bitcoin can hold its current floor or be forced into lower-range exploration.","gravity_id":"371756773","id":13507,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T22:00:16.924Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T22:00:16.924Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T21:53:00.190Z","text_content":"$BTC bitcoin doesn't punish disbelief. it teaches patience","gravity_id":"371756768","id":13508,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T22:00:17.122Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T22:00:17.122Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T22:02:31.654Z","text_content":"💥 JUST IN: 🇺🇸 The CFTC launches a pilot program for tokenized collateral in derivatives markets, allowing $BTC , $ETH , and #USDC  to be used as margin  The move aims to provides greater regulatory clarity for the use of digital assets in tradfi markets 📈  #CFTC  #BTC  #ETH  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371756822","id":13519,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T22:10:03.224Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T22:10:06.012Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T22:09:23.688Z","text_content":"$BTC\nOOOOH AGAIN 91K.

I’m locked in and ready to climb the leaderboard again.  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season# ﻿ #Bitcoin  $BTC","gravity_id":"371759329","id":13595,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T22:50:12.235Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T22:50:12.235Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T23:00:00.167Z","text_content":"$BTC bitcoin doesn't fight inflation. it forbids it by design","gravity_id":"371760354","id":13607,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T23:00:14.824Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T23:10:05.862Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T22:53:00.168Z","text_content":"$BTC bitcoin doesn't require rescue. it rescues reliability","gravity_id":"371760293","id":13609,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T23:00:15.565Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T23:00:15.565Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T22:52:45.039Z","text_content":"Insane Black Friday Deal For Ledger Wallets\n\nSecure your coins now and get FREE BITCOIN!\n\n$80 BTC Voucher with Ledger Stax™\n$70 BTC Voucher with Ledger Flex™\n50% OFF all Ledger Nano X™ colors\n\nGrab your Ledger wallet here!👇\n\nhttps://shop.ledger.com/r/lark-davis?r=6877 ","gravity_id":"371760286","id":13610,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T23:00:15.714Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T23:00:15.714Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T23:07:45.244Z","text_content":"🗞️ Big signal from Bitcoin Mena: A UAE wealth manager is launching a fund with a 5% #Bitcoin allocation, matching its gold exposure. \n\n🎙️ @_dsencil x @graminitha1 break down how traditional multi-asset products in the region are starting to treat $BTC as a core position. 🔽 ","gravity_id":"371759534","id":13618,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T23:10:04.952Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T23:20:09.455Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T23:07:07.274Z","text_content":"$BTC \r \r My Ideal scenario.\r \r Optimism kicks in, everyone starts calling for 100K again, then price accepts back into range an breaks below 90K.\r \r If we got this scenario, I will be triggering into swing shorts down to 74K.","gravity_id":"371760406","id":13619,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T23:10:05.196Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T23:10:05.196Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T23:06:00.184Z","text_content":"$BTC they can ban apps, not ideas","gravity_id":"371760397","id":13620,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T23:10:05.384Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T23:10:05.384Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T23:05:39.155Z","text_content":"Have you redeemed your daily diamonds ?\n$BTC #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"371759519","id":13621,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T23:10:05.562Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T23:10:05.562Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T23:01:45.052Z","text_content":"If you think Bitcoin dropping below $80k is risky, just wait until you realize your coffee’s still overpriced! ☕💸  \n\nStay unpredictable!   \n\n👉 https://bitcoininfonews.com/p/bitcoin-drop-below-80000-threat.webm  \n\n#Bitcoin #Crypto #InvestSmart #HODL #MarketTrends ","gravity_id":"371760369","id":13622,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T23:10:05.740Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T23:10:05.740Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T23:20:00.166Z","text_content":"$BTC bitcoin doesn't need permission to exist. it just keeps running","gravity_id":"371759638","id":13626,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T23:20:07.857Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T23:30:17.029Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T23:15:00.078Z","text_content":"\"Next time I'll use stop loss.\" - You, after every loss.

While this indicates some buying interest, the long wick highlights immediate and strong selling pressure at higher levels. The bounce lacks conviction across all timeframes, characterized by low-volume advances and sharp rejections. The overall structure suggests this is a corrective bounce within the context of a persisting weekly downtrend, rather than a trend reversal.  Daily:  Price Action: The daily candle is a small bullish candle with a very long upper shadow, closing below the EMA9. The higher volume compared to the preceding down days is a minor positive, but the price rejection dominates the narrative. Key Levels: Immediate resistance is the EMA9, which price briefly tested and failed to hold. The next significant hurdle is the EMA21. Support lies at the recent swing lows. Momentum: The daily MACD lines continue to run parallel and upward. However, the critical observation is the histogram behavior: it has halted its sequential decline but has not yet begun a new sequence of growth. This signifies a pause in bearish momentum, not a resurgence of bullish momentum.  4H & 1H:  Price Action Pattern: Both intraday timeframes exhibit inefficient, whipsaw price action. Rallies (like yesterday's) are met with sharp, higher-volume sell-offs (\"buy the rumor, sell the news\"), preventing sustained progress. The moving averages (EMA9, 21, 50) are converged and tangled, reflecting a complete lack of short-term trend. Momentum: Momentum oscillators are noisy and inconclusive. The 4H MACD is flipping bearish after a brief uptick, while the 1H MACD is caught around the zero line. This reflects the market's indecision. Volume: Advances continue to lack significant volume, while sell-offs see relative spikes. This volume profile confirms the weak nature of the bounce.","gravity_id":"371760615","id":13660,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T23:40:11.000Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T23:40:11.000Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T23:33:00.144Z","text_content":"$BTC i'm not a degen, i'm a scientist studying hope under stress","gravity_id":"371760587","id":13661,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T23:40:11.367Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T23:40:11.367Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-08T23:30:00.090Z","text_content":"$PUMP  living up to the name?

He described holding cash as like holding a \"melting ice cube.\"\n * Superior Store of Value (\"Digital Gold\"): He views Bitcoin as \"digital gold\"—scarce, secure, and designed to outlast fiat currencies. Its fixed supply of 21 million Bitcoins is seen as protection from inflationary pressures.\n * Maximizing Shareholder Value: The strategy aimed to shift treasury assets from cash to Bitcoin to maximize long-term shareholder value, viewing Bitcoin as a strategic investment with significant growth potential, not just a defensive hedge.\n * Technological Belief: Saylor sees Bitcoin as \"digital energy\" and a fundamentally different type of asset—an \"invisible, indestructible, immortal, and teleportable\" digital building. He believes it is \"the truth in money.\"\nMicroStrategy made its initial purchase of 21,454 Bitcoin for $250 million in August 2020, marking the start of its Bitcoin-as-reserve strategy.","gravity_id":"371765139","id":13915,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T03:10:20.947Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T03:10:20.947Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T03:07:45.101Z","text_content":"Bitcoin Bear Signal Flashes Red 75% Crash Ahead \nhttps://coincryptonewz.com/bitcoin-bear-signal-flashes-red-75-crash-ahead/\n#bitcoin #news #coincryptonewz #crypto","gravity_id":"371766007","id":13916,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T03:10:21.178Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T03:10:21.178Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T03:07:33.815Z","text_content":"🇺🇸 Senator Cynthia Predicts #Bitcoin  Will Hit $10M per $BTC    Senator Cynthia Lummis predicts Bitcoin’s market cap could hit $200 trillion.

Some of these “Yes” positions were so big that the total money at risk on the “Yes” side reached almost $1 billion in notional value.\n\nIn a prediction market like Polymarket, every “Yes” share that someone buys must have a matching “No” share on the other side. When there aren’t enough people naturally betting “No”, the platform’s automated system creates those “No” shares and offers them to the market so trading can continue smoothly. Those automatic “No” shares are what people are now calling the “$1B strategy”.\n\nSo it looks like Polymarket itself is betting $1 billion against Bitcoin hitting the target, but that’s not true. Polymarket isn’t taking a side or using secret information. It’s just balancing the book the same way a stock exchange or betting site matches buyers and sellers. The platform makes its money from small trading fees, not from winning or losing the bets.\n\nEverything is 100% public. Anyone could see these giant “Yes” positions sitting on Polymarket for weeks. There was no front-running and no hidden edge. A few traders and newsletters just saw the huge open “No” side, bought those cheap “No” shares (betting against the whale), and now they’re making money because Bitcoin didn’t hit the exact target in time.\n\nBottom line: it’s just a normal (but very big) prediction market trade that got hyped up with a scary title. Nothing shady, no insider magic, just loud marketing.  \r\n#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"371767078","id":14092,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T05:30:12.532Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T05:30:12.532Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T05:20:41.050Z","text_content":"$BTC non stop dumping we have CME gap at 51,800 lets go down there and fill out already LMAO","gravity_id":"371766943","id":14093,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T05:30:12.646Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T05:30:12.646Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T05:20:34.573Z","text_content":"$BTC Is Death","gravity_id":"371767067","id":14094,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T05:30:12.821Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T05:30:12.821Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T05:40:00.106Z","text_content":"$BTC bitcoin doesn't inflate the world. it deflates the lie","gravity_id":"371767277","id":14102,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T05:40:21.328Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T05:40:21.328Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T05:38:08.219Z","text_content":"$BTC ponzi scheme","gravity_id":"371768136","id":14103,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T05:40:21.525Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T05:40:21.525Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T05:35:45.306Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $BTC  The trend update:  Bitcoin is still into uptrend and no reason for selling BTC now","gravity_id":"371768111","id":14104,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T05:40:21.936Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T05:40:21.936Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T05:34:45.058Z","text_content":"Rolex Raffle Snapshot is live.\n\nEach $1,000 of PnL = 1 raffle ticket.\n\nTotal tickets across the Top 10: 659.\n\nTomorrow’s winner will be selected using a provably fair method based on Bitcoin block #927,155, which has not been mined yet. \nTickets are assigned sequentially based on the number each trader earned. \n\nThis keeps the system transparent and easy to verify. \n\nLarger PnL = more tickets = a wider range.\n\nHere are the ticket counts and their exact ranges:\n• marcellous — 276 tickets (1–276)\n\n• liqudated — 140 tickets (277–416)\n\n• youngplatitude549 — 54 tickets (417–470)\n\n• 9000 — 47 tickets (471–517)\n• glhf — 38 tickets (518–555)\n\n• rldska1010 — 34 tickets (556–589)\n\n• tdf1 — 28 tickets (590–617)\n\n• BaronTrumpReal69 — 18 tickets (618–635)\n\n• god — 14 tickets (636–649)\n\n• JADAWGS — 10 tickets (650–659)\nThe winner will be computed using the hash from Bitcoin block #927,155. \n\nBecause this block hasn’t been mined yet, nobody knows the hash and nobody can influence it.\n\nThis makes the draw fully transparent and provably fair.\nThe exact formula we’ll use:\n\nwinning_ticket = (block_hash_as_integer % 659) + 1\n\nWe will publish the block hash, the script output, and the winning ticket so anyone can verify the result.\n\nWinner announced tomorrow at 9am EST.","gravity_id":"371768102","id":14105,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T05:40:22.403Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T05:40:22.403Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T05:33:00.091Z","text_content":"$BTC bitcoin doesn't follow markets. markets follow bitcoin's morality","gravity_id":"371768070","id":14106,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T05:40:22.620Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T05:40:22.620Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T05:32:15.976Z","text_content":"People calling this the “Polymarket $1B front-run strategy” are really just falling for hype.

Prediction markets have to match every “Yes” with a “No,” and when there aren’t enough natural “No” bettors, the system automatically creates them so trading doesn’t freeze.

Here we go again, Spotters - $BTC  jumps, the internet panics, and Strategy quietly scoops up another 10,624 BTC like it’s a Costco bulk purchase. 😂  Between Dec 1–7, Strategy dropped $963M on BTC, pushing their total stash to 660,624 BTC - more than 3% of max supply and nearly $60B at current prices. Oh, and they funded it by selling stock faster than traders rage-close losing positions.  So why the Polymarket buzz? Users spotted prediction markets pricing in Strategy’s mega-purchase before the filing went public… sparking debates about whether the crowd is getting smarter - or if the system is getting leakier. 👀  📌 Key points:  • Strategy created a $1.44B cash reserve, giving them breathing room before ever needing to dump BTC. • JPMorgan analysts say Strategy’s continued buying can literally “influence market direction.” • Over 190 companies are trying to copy this treasury strategy - but many are bleeding as their token holdings rise while their stock drops.  So… insider edge or market flaw? Prediction markets have a habit of sniffing out truth early. The real question is whether this transparency is a feature of crypto markets - or a symptom of information escaping before filings hit the public.  Either way, Strategy keeps buying.

Now the government is reversing course, aiming to restore confidence and bring investors back.  Key Takeaways  🔹 Crypto profits will be taxed at a flat 20%, not 55%. 🔹 $BTC   and major assets are now classified as financial instruments - same as stocks/bonds. 🔹 Exchanges must maintain investor protection reserves for hacks or operational failures. 🔹 22% of former investors quit due to tax complexity, a major barrier now removed.  Why This Matters  Japan’s crypto market has been stuck in a confidence slump. Surveys show: • 60% cite tax complexity as a top challenge • 61.4% cite volatility • Reporting requirements have been a massive administrative burden  The new regime cuts friction, boosts transparency, and opens the door for institutional participation.  Bigger Picture  More than 105 approved assets will fall under stricter FIEA rules, requiring issuers to disclose tech details, risks, and operational structures. Exchanges must hold liability reserves, a move that strengthens trust but raises compliance costs for smaller players.  Market Outlook  Japan plans to finalize and implement the reforms in fiscal year 2026. Analysts already call this a structural bullish shift that aligns digital assets with traditional finance.  With 62.7% of Japanese investors targeting long-term wealth accumulation, a simpler and fairer tax system may finally unlock steady inflows.  💡 Crypto in Japan is no longer an outlier - it's becoming part of the financial mainstream. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#  #BTC","gravity_id":"371778045","id":14587,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T10:10:04.251Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T10:10:04.251Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T10:07:52.791Z","text_content":"#Bitcoin  has been steady despite recent market swings, but what’s really standing out is how traders are expanding beyond crypto.

That brings their total stash to 660,624 BTC, worth over $49B - with an average entry of $74,696.  With $BTC  now at $94K (+3% in 24h), it’s clear: Saylor’s “buy and buy more” strategy isn’t slowing down anytime soon.  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"371773444","id":14610,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T10:20:05.622Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T10:20:05.622Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T10:14:35.174Z","text_content":"$BTC  is starting to look like that quiet giant gearing up for its next move… and honestly, this is exactly where Get Agent AI copy trading shines.

The key pressure point: spot BTC ETF inflows have slowed sharply, removing one of the strongest demand engines of the last quarter. With short-term support holding at $88,000, the market is paused rather than panicked - but direction now hinges almost entirely on the upcoming FOMC decision.  Demand has softened, not collapsed. ETF inflows that previously added hundreds of millions per day have cooled, reducing buy-side depth at higher levels. At the same time, profit-taking near all-time highs continues to cap upside. Macro uncertainty keeps liquidity sidelined until policy clarity emerges.  FOMC Scenarios That Matter 📊 • Dovish or neutral signal: Risk appetite could rebound, reopening ETF inflows and helping BTC retest $94K with potential extension higher. • Hawkish tone: No immediate breakdown expected, but consolidation likely extends, with price drifting back toward support levels.  Bitcoin’s hesitation is structural, not bearish. The next decisive move will come from macro conditions - not intraday volatility. Until policy turns supportive and inflows strengthen, BTC is likely to orbit the $90K level.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"371773793","id":14723,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T11:20:05.521Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T11:20:05.521Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T11:16:45.057Z","text_content":"When Bitcoin dips, it's not a crisis—it's a clearance sale! 🛒💰\n\nBuy, hold, and laugh while others panic.

Bitcoin’s early-week momentum evaporated as $BTC   fell toward $90K again, mirroring last week’s failed breakout. With traders now laser-focused on Wednesday’s Fed rate cut, the market is entering a high-risk, low-clarity zone. ⚠️  A 25 bps cut is already priced in - which means the real danger isn’t the decision itself, but the lack of new bullish catalysts. If nothing fresh appears, risk assets may sell the news.  Key takeaways: 🔹 BTC trades near $90,150, down from $92,350 🔹 Altcoins hit cycle lows - HYPE, STRK, QNT, KAS drop 6–9% 🔹 CMC’s altcoin-season index: 18/100, extreme risk-off 🔹 Over 50% of top-100 tokens fell 40%+ in 90 days 🔹 Yet ZEC, DASH, BCH and BNB hold unusually stable  Derivatives signal caution, not panic: 📉 Implied volatility for BTC/ETH stays steady - no pre-Fed fear spike 📊 Puts remain pricier than calls → traders hedge downside 📉 Open interest drops across majors, except ZEC, which hits near-record levels  Market narrative right now: Bitcoin is down 20% in 90 days, but altcoins are experiencing a full capitulation cycle. Liquidity is thin, appetite for speculative assets collapsed, and macro uncertainty is dictating micro-structure behavior.  BTC has one job: stay above the danger zone long enough for the macro picture to shift.  💡 Takeaway: With the rate cut already “priced in,” volatility around the Fed announcement could become a trap. Traders should expect sharp moves in both directions - but until new catalysts appear, the market remains defensively positioned. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#  #BTC","gravity_id":"371776026","id":14836,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T12:20:06.154Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T12:20:06.154Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T12:13:36.296Z","text_content":"$WOO  TA RATIONALE: ✔ MSS confirmed → bullish shift ✔ Trading near premium-discount zone → optimal entry ✔ Liquidity above $0.0383–$0.0400 → strong upside magnet ✔ Previous month low swept → internal liquidity fueling reversal  Entry: $0.0287 | SL: $0.0232 | Targets: $0.0383/$0.0400  Strategy: Hold above MSS & enter on clean retest  #WOO  #Altcoins  $BTC","gravity_id":"371776013","id":14837,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T12:20:06.318Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T12:20:06.318Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T12:27:22.397Z","text_content":"Bitcoin just recorded one of its weakest Novembers since 2018.\n\nData from Presto Research points to a clear driver:\n\nEuropean trading hours led the sell-off, while Asia and the U.S. remained mostly neutral.\n\n  $BTC and ETH dropped between -20% and -25% over the month.\n\nEurope triggered the pressure now the question is: who takes over in December?\n\n#Bitcoin #BTC","gravity_id":"371776093","id":14844,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T12:30:04.540Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T12:30:04.540Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T12:27:09.634Z","text_content":"$BTC is over ?","gravity_id":"371776091","id":14845,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T12:30:04.715Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T12:30:04.715Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T12:26:43.481Z","text_content":"⚠️ 230,000 $BTC  has been pulled from exchanges over the past year, with balances dropping from 3.16M to 2.93M.

It’s impressive to see how much the platform has evolved in just a few months. From leading the copy-trading space to now making major strides in stock futures with over $10B in cumulative volume in just three months that kind of growth doesn't happen by chance. The effort behind the scene is clearly paying off  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371777786","id":14851,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T12:30:05.887Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T12:30:05.887Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T12:40:00.144Z","text_content":"$BTC when trust disappears, bitcoin appears","gravity_id":"371777912","id":14862,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T12:40:04.848Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T12:50:05.907Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T12:37:45.072Z","text_content":"Bitcoin Entering a Supply Shock?

With the asset sitting at a $1.6T market cap, this kind of leverage access is a different level of mainstream integration.\n\nWhy this matters:\n• BTC becomes usable financial collateral, not just a speculative asset\n• Sell pressure drops when clients can borrow instead of liquidating\n• Banks that once dismissed crypto are now building around it\n• JPMorgan is reportedly preparing to accept Bitcoin directly by late 2025\n\nMy take:\n\nOne of the most obvious indicators of Bitcoin's maturity is this.  It's more about infrastructure than hype when big banks begin to support collateralised Bitcoin lending.  Businesses that previously had their doubts are now discreetly getting ready for a future in which Bitcoin is used in regular financial transactions.\n\nDo you see this accelerating broader institutional adoption?\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371776925","id":15100,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T14:50:11.255Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T14:50:11.255Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T15:00:00.150Z","text_content":"$BTC they print debt. we stack truth","gravity_id":"371782016","id":15108,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T15:00:04.367Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T15:00:04.367Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T14:59:09.836Z","text_content":"$BTC crypto are dead people start go away since only lost money","gravity_id":"371779750","id":15109,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T15:00:04.550Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T15:00:04.550Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T14:58:45.037Z","text_content":"Coinbase has enabled direct Bitcoin trading for PNC Bank’s private banking clients, making it the first major U.S. bank to offer such access.
