However, this move occurs on the cusp of a high-impact macroeconomic event: the December 10th Federal Reserve interest rate decision and press conference. The recent rally from lows has been closely correlated with a dramatic shift in market expectations, with the probability of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut soaring. This underscores that the current bullish momentum is intrinsically linked to anticipations of improved macro liquidity. Consequently, the short-term trajectory is highly contingent on the Fed's communicated policy path, making today a critical inflection point that overrides pure technical analysis.\r \r  Macroeconomic Overlay: The Primary Driver\r \r Catalyst: The FOMC Monetary Policy Decision.\r \r The market is in a \"structural repair\" phase, heavily driven by the \"turn in macro liquidity expectations\". \r \r  Implication for BTC: Bitcoin's behavior is increasingly aligned with traditional risk assets. \r A dovish outcome (rate cut with guidance for future easing) could validate the rally and propel prices toward the $95,000-$100,000 range. \r A hawkish surprise (no cut or restrictive guidance) risks triggering a \"fragile rally\" reversal, potentially leading to a retest of supports in the $85,000-$88,000 zone.\r \r  Technical Picture\r Daily: \r Price Action: A large bullish candle broke and closed above the EMA21 (~$91,698), confirming near-term strength. The rally extended to $94,600, briefly testing the 4-hour EMA200.\r Momentum: The Daily MACD lines continue their parallel ascent, with the histogram shifting to a new sequence of growth, confirming recovering bullish momentum. This aligns with aggregated technical views signaling strength.\r Volume & Concern: Volume increased but not conclusively. The overarching weekly trend remains bearish, capping the bullish thesis.","gravity_id":"371793429","id":16092,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T23:50:04.512Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T23:50:04.512Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T23:46:00.127Z","text_content":"$BTC each candle reminds me how fragile my confidence is","gravity_id":"371793420","id":16093,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T23:50:04.683Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T23:50:04.683Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T23:44:53.007Z","text_content":"$BTC  The data shows that this process is normal, and the timeframe further confirms that this is a legitimate volume so far","gravity_id":"371793417","id":16094,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T23:50:04.857Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T23:50:04.857Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T23:42:32.360Z","text_content":"$BTCits obviously trap 🤣","gravity_id":"371793397","id":16096,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T23:50:05.197Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T23:50:05.197Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T23:42:00.114Z","text_content":"$BTC  after the trend gets all panic sellers out PNL takers, it will keep moving to 96k+","gravity_id":"371793394","id":16097,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T23:50:05.424Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T23:50:05.424Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-10T00:00:00.129Z","text_content":"$BTC fiat counts inflation as income. bitcoin counts scarcity as wealth","gravity_id":"371793536","id":16102,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T00:00:04.870Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T00:10:04.863Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T23:59:01.936Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $BTC","gravity_id":"371793529","id":16103,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T00:00:05.081Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T00:10:05.033Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-09T23:58:45.070Z","text_content":"After a rough patch for much of 2025, Bitcoin treasuries are starting to show strength.

The system runs on Coinbase’s Crypto-as-a-Service stack, which handles trading and custody under one infrastructure.\n\n- This is the first phase of a broader partnership announced in July.\n\n- PNC is the eighth-largest commercial bank in the country. Per reports, banks that once avoided direct exposure now want in, as clients ask for simple and safe access to Bitcoin.\n\nA Growing Market of Wealthy Crypto Holders\n\n- Interest in Bitcoin has grown among high- and ultra-high-net-worth clients. These groups want exposure without leaving the regulated banking system. PNC’s move meets that demand.\n\n- Other large banks are moving too, but with different strategies. Bank of America will soon let wealth clients access four Bitcoin ETFs. JPMorgan now accepts crypto ETFs as loan collateral and factors digital assets into net-worth reviews.\n\n- Most banks stop at custody or investment products. PNC went further and opened direct trading.\n\nWhat Comes Next\n\n- PNC plans to expand access to more client groups and add more features as the service matures.\n\n- The move also pressures other US banks to speed up their digital-asset plans, especially as clients shift wealth toward Bitcoin during market volatility.","gravity_id":"371799415","id":16422,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T04:50:06.825Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T04:50:06.825Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-10T04:43:15.364Z","text_content":"$BTC  Everyone is now making AI chips, the AI bubble is bursting.
