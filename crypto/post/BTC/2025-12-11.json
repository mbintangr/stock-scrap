The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday to a target range of 3.5% to 3.75%. However, mixed comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will likely quell a Bitcoin price rally until the rate cutting cycle resumes in 2026, analysts say.  “In the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside, a challenging situation. There is no risk free path for policy,” Powell said at Wednesday’s Federal Reserve Open Committee (FOMC) meeting. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371831038","id":18223,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T22:30:05.739Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T22:30:05.739Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-10T22:26:32.083Z","text_content":"$BTC 😂😂😂that lasted for about a half hour","gravity_id":"371831034","id":18224,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T22:30:05.882Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T22:30:05.882Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-10T22:26:09.411Z","text_content":"$4 .46 trillion NVIDIA CEO: “ $BTC   is taking excess energy, storing it into a new form — it's called currency.”  “And you take that currency wherever you like.

PaxGold is nice, but it’s still tied to gold stored in a vault, whereas Bitcoin is freely tradable on exchanges and accessible to everyone.\n\nMy advice: don’t panic and sell Bitcoin during uncertainty. Hold it, and consider combining it with gold. You can do a 50-50 split, but I personally go for a 70-30 strategy—70% Bitcoin, 30% gold—because Bitcoin is ultimately a stronger growth asset.

The failure to sustain a breakout above $94,500, coupled with shrinking volume and neutralized momentum indicators, indicates that the pre-FED bullish expectation has been exhausted. The market is now digesting the event within a defined range, awaiting the next directional catalyst.\r \r  🔥Macro Context: “Buy the Rumor, Sell the News” in Action  \r \r The pre-meeting rally from ~$88k to ~$94.5k was fueled by aggressive market pricing of a dovish Fed pivot.\r The actual meeting delivered largely as-expected guidance (holding rates, projecting cuts in 2024), providing no fresh positive surprise to fuel further buying.\r Consequently, the event acted as a catalyst for profit-taking rather than a launchpad, leading to the observed \"high wick\" rejection and reversion to a mean.\r \r  💪Technical Picture\r \r  Daily: \r Pattern: The small bearish candle with a pronounced upper shadow is a clear sign of seller dominance at higher prices. Closing above the EMA21 offers minor support but does not negate the rejection.\r Momentum: The daily MACD's lines are parallel, but the choppy, directionless histogram confirms a complete loss of bullish momentum acceleration.\r \r  👀4H & 1H: \r Structure: Price is oscillating between clear boundaries: Resistance ~$94,400-$94,500 (confluence with 4H EMA200) and Support ~$92,000-$92,500 (prior breakout zone & EMAs).\r Market State: Progressively declining volume and compressing volatility (as you noted on the 1H) are hallmarks of a market in equilibrium, storing energy for its next directional move.\r Momentum: Oscillators (MACD, RSI) are neutral and weaving around their midlines, providing no actionable signals.","gravity_id":"371831595","id":18340,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T23:50:04.972Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T23:50:04.972Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-10T23:46:45.057Z","text_content":"When sovereign wealth funds buy Bitcoin during a dip, it’s not just savvy—it's like buying flood insurance while it’s raining! 🌧️💰\n\nWonder what's cooking at BlackRock?

October’s data showed job openings rising slightly to 7.67M, but hiring falling sharply by 218,000 — a combination that signals cooling momentum.\n\nWhat’s raising eyebrows is that inflation data is now delayed until January after Trump postponed its release for the first time in over a decade. That left policymakers making a major rate decision without current CPI numbers, something several Fed members and economists openly worried about.\n\nMarkets reacted instantly:\n• Dow +230 points\n• S&P 500 and Russell also moved higher\n• Fed’s new 2025 Summary of Economic Projections points to one rate cut in 2026, unchanged from September’s outlook\n\nNotably, three Fed officials dissented, including Stephen Miran — favored by Trump — who argued for a sharper 50bps cut.\n\n\nThis cut signals a Fed leaning more toward protecting the labor market than fighting inflation right now. But with incomplete data and political pressure in the background, the path ahead feels less predictable than usual. Markets like it in the short term — but clarity on inflation will decide how durable this move is.\n\nDo you think the Fed is acting early… or acting blind without updated inflation numbers?\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights# #Altcoin Season# \n $BTC","gravity_id":"371832777","id":18642,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T03:00:05.291Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T03:00:05.291Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T02:50:25.178Z","text_content":"NEWS: A restaurant in El Salvador has become the first to announce a corporate $BTC   treasury, signaling growing #Bitcoin  adoption among businesses worldwide.","gravity_id":"371832765","id":18643,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T03:00:05.432Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T03:00:05.432Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T02:49:45.066Z","text_content":"When banks become crypto intermediaries, does that mean my piggy bank is the next Bitcoin? 🐷💰  \n\nWelcome to the future! 🚀  \n\n$BTC $ETH $ADA  \n\n#CryptoNews #BankingRevolution #HODL  \n\n👉 https://theccpress.com/p/occ-banks-crypto-intermediary-regulation.webm ","gravity_id":"371833123","id":18644,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T03:00:05.554Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T03:00:05.554Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T03:08:59.199Z","text_content":"$BTC fuck","gravity_id":"371833265","id":18653,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T03:10:05.319Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T03:10:05.319Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T03:08:58.219Z","text_content":"🚀  $BTC Spiked But Caution Hits Hard\n\nBTC jumped on small news and fresh money but the Daily candle shows a rejection wick right at resistance This can turn into a trap for early bulls If It becomes a clean close above the zone then momentum is real until then patience is key\n\n\n\n#BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"371832902","id":18654,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T03:10:05.457Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T03:10:05.457Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T03:08:54.093Z","text_content":"Bitcoin Struggles at Value Area High as Bears Target Lower Liquidity Zones\r \r \r \r   Bitcoin continues to show weakness after multiple failed attempts to reclaim the value area high beneath the $95,559 resistance.

This was the third rate cut of the year, but traders were clearly hoping for a deeper 50bps slash. When Powell confirmed just one more cut expected in 2026, it sealed the choppy reaction we’re seeing now. And honestly, most of this move was already priced in, Polymarket had the odds of a cut sitting at 99% hours before the press conference.  From the chart, BTC is trying to hold the breakout zone, but there’s no strong follow-through yet. That tells me buyers are waiting for real liquidity expansion, not just a symbolic trim. If ETF inflows recover and dip demand shows up, BTC can stabilize and grind higher. But if volume fades and risk appetite cools like we’ve seen many times after an FOMC spike, BTC could easily retrace to retest key supports. Right now, it’s a battle between expectation vs. reality, and the next 24–48 hours will show whether bulls step in or step aside.  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"371833887","id":18788,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T04:40:05.038Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T04:40:05.038Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T04:37:51.510Z","text_content":"EARLIER: SpaceX moves 1,021 BTC (~$94M) to two addresses amid potential 2026 IPO reports #BTC #Bitcoin $BTC #SpaceX","gravity_id":"371833884","id":18789,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T04:40:05.238Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T04:40:05.238Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T04:37:45.899Z","text_content":"$BTC  is showing solid strength, and I can feel traders rushing in as the charts heat up, with volumes topping $30K during Bitget’s Crazy 48H event.

For #Bitcoin  , that creates a tricky setup. Personally, I think $BTC  can hold its gains, but only if the market reads this cut as the start of a cycle, not a one-off gesture.  Here’s why I’m leaning cautiously bullish:  When the Fed cuts during weakness rather than panic, risk assets usually get a slow, steady tailwind. BTC thrives in that environment, especially with #ETFs   acting as a constant absorption engine. But there’s also a real chance of a pullback. Markets tend to “sell the confirmation,” especially after pricing in the cut for weeks. If macro fear rises again; recession whispers, weak jobs data, dollar strength, BTC could dip back to key support before pushing higher.

Price is currently forming a textbook bear flag, characterized by: - A strong impulsive move down (flagpole) - A controlled, low volume corrective grind upward (flag) - Gradually weakening momentum as we approach resistance  The grey zone on the chart is my preferred area to scale into shorts. As long as price remains within this rising wedge and fails to reclaim the upper boundary with conviction, the structural bias continues to favor downside.  Base scenario: - A breakdown from the flag triggers continuation - Liquidity is targeted in the $80k–$82k region, which aligns with prior demand and untested inefficiency - From that zone, I expect a healthier foundation for the next higher timeframe impulse  Until the structure is invalidated, every slow push upward is treated as a corrective move rather than a trend reversal. My outlook remains unchanged: a controlled retest of the $80k region before any meaningful upside expansion.","gravity_id":"371835929","id":19018,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T06:50:04.837Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T07:00:05.586Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T06:47:15.343Z","text_content":"$BTC\n HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nAND AGAIN 🤣😂😹 \n94K AND AGAIN 88K \nHHAHAHAHAAHA\nITS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE 🤭","gravity_id":"371836552","id":19019,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T06:50:05.039Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T07:00:05.706Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T06:46:45.284Z","text_content":"🔸 According to @cryptoquant_com, declining selling pressure may create room for a potential relief rally in Bitcoin \n\n🔸 The analysis suggests $BTC could advance toward $99K, aligning with the lower band of the Trader Realized Price — a critical resistance zone \n\n🔸 The next crucial levels are at $102K and $112K \n\nIf BTC gains momentum, which level do you think it smashes first? 👀\n\n#Bitcoin #BTC #BTCPrice #Crypto #MarketAnalysis","gravity_id":"371835915","id":19020,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T06:50:05.245Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T07:00:05.827Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T06:46:00.108Z","text_content":"$BTC every rebound tricks me into believing again","gravity_id":"371835909","id":19021,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T06:50:05.526Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T06:50:05.526Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T06:42:20.231Z","text_content":"$BTC  The convergence is happening at the perfect moment:  💥 Crypto = programmable money, self-sovereign identity, trust-minimized coordination 🤖 AI = intelligence, autonomy, decision-making 💠 RWAs = bridge physical and digital worlds","gravity_id":"371835890","id":19022,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T06:50:05.960Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T06:50:05.960Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T06:42:00.611Z","text_content":"I wanted to double-check whether AI listings really perform well on launch day, so I asked GetAgent for November’s list and reviewed them myself.

The rate cut widely anticipated and largely priced in injected brief optimism into markets, but crypto traders remain cautious. Risk assets historically benefit from easier monetary policy, and several analysts argue that lower yields could push sidelined liquidity back into Bitcoin. With traditional assets offering weaker returns, $BTC   may reclaim its position as a preferred high-beta play for institutions and macro-focused investors.  Others, however, point to the mixed macro backdrop. According to derivatives traders and fund analysts, Bitcoin’s muted follow-through signals that the market may be treating the rate decision as “old news.” Many warn of a potential “sell-the-news” effect, especially if ETF flows remain soft or whales begin derisking into strength. Some macro commentators also note that the Fed’s tone remains cautious, conditions that could cap risk-on appetite in the near term.  Market watchers are now laser-focused on three key variables: institutional inflows, Fed guidance in upcoming sessions, and on-chain demand stability. Without renewed demand from large holders or clearer macro momentum, the probability of a BTC pullback remains elevated.  For now, Bitcoin sits at a crossroads supported by a friendlier rate environment, yet constrained by fragile sentiment. Whether BTC holds or retraces from here will depend less on the cut itself and more on how the next wave of capital responds to it.","gravity_id":"371837179","id":19064,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T07:20:04.769Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T07:20:04.769Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T07:19:27.654Z","text_content":"OvenAdd: Why XRP Might Outperform Bitcoin ( $BTC  ) by 2030 What do you think?","gravity_id":"371836811","id":19065,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T07:20:04.972Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T07:20:04.972Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T07:13:47.186Z","text_content":"Red November, Red December?  \r \r \r $BTC  usually follows November’s trend, but this time it’s different.  \r \r \r December is -0.64% so far.

Redirecting Launchpool rewards into CandyBomb during new token launches has become my go-to strategy. #Macro Insights#   #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"371837264","id":19078,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T07:30:05.121Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T07:30:05.121Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T07:27:46.460Z","text_content":"📊 #Crypto Fear and Greed Index \n\n🧭 Index Value : 29\n😱 Sentiment : Fear\n💰 BTC Price : $91987\n\n#Meme Alpha# #BNBChain# #BTC Price Analysis#  $BTC","gravity_id":"371837251","id":19079,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T07:30:05.282Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T07:30:05.282Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T07:26:53.534Z","text_content":"$BTC bull run ❌bull shit ✅","gravity_id":"371836872","id":19080,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T07:30:05.486Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T07:30:05.486Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T07:26:00.091Z","text_content":"$BTC every generation thinks they discovered bitcoin. in truth, bitcoin discovered them","gravity_id":"371837230","id":19081,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T07:30:05.693Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T07:30:05.693Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T07:24:17.251Z","text_content":"Every dump has a short opportunity.

The question now is whether $BTC  can maintain this momentum or if another pullback is likely.  Lower rates generally support liquidity, and early trading shows increased inflows into both spot markets and crypto funds. Order books on major exchanges are showing healthier bid support compared to last week’s volatility, suggesting that buyers are more willing to step in at current levels.  Still, some traders remain cautious. BTC has struggled to sustain rallies in recent weeks, often giving back gains as leveraged positions unwind. With open interest rising again, the possibility of short-term profit-taking remains high.  If spot demand continues as liquidity conditions improve, Bitcoin could stabilise above its recent breakout zone. If not, the market may revisit support levels as traders wait for clearer confirmation that the rate cut marks the start of a more accommodative policy cycle.

WHAT'S THE 5 YEARS MARKET PREDICTION?\n\nThe United States currently holds about 198000 in   $BTC Reserves. This is called the \"Bitcoin Strategic Reserves\", Michael Saylor the formal CEO of microStrategy in December 2024, advised the U.S to dump all gold reserves and start buying Bitcoin. \n\nIn March 2025, the United States Government acted on this advice, but strategically. The White House + Treasury set the reserve using seized crypto, and officials (Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent) have explicitly said the government isn’t going to be buying more BTC outright, it’s keeping seized assets and exploring “budget-neutral” options instead. Buying billions on the open market with taxpayer money is politically explosive. \n\nOther factors that stops the US opening buying crypto might include, Central bank independence & monetary policy risk, Financial-stability concerns, etc. If the White house have a plan then it has to be carried out quietly and strategically.\n\nmicroStrategy currently holds about 661,000  $BTC, their recent purchase of 10,624  $BTC was early December 2025. This is approximately 3.3% of 19.96Million of Bitcoin circulating supply. This also implies today, December 11 2025, with Bitcoins MC at $1.89 trillion and Bitcoin price roughly $92,000, microStrategy shares 60.6B of this MC. \n\nJust like what United states did with Nvidia to dominate the AI market, they can hold strategic shares of microStrategy as well, giving them the leverage of the 661k  $BTC holdings of MSTR. \n\nThis sounds speculative, but U.S is signalling that it recognizes digital assets or atleast BTC, as potentially strategic. In a short time, this will influence how other nations treat digital assets. Infact this is beginning to blur the line between traditional asset reserves ( such as gold, foreign currencies etc) and decentralized digital assets.

Traders are puzzled: bullish macro factors aren’t translating into price strength, hinting at deeper liquidity and sentiment shifts.  Why BTC Pulled Back:  Fed cuts aren’t fueling risk appetite: Investors are de-risking, treating rate cuts as a safety net, not a bullish signal. ETF inflows slowing: Structural support remains, but inflows have cooled sharply, offsetting passive selling. Liquidity drying up: Stablecoin inflows flattening mean even moderate selling pressures push BTC lower.  Technically, BTC remains below $92,000–$93,000 resistance, under the 20-day SMA and mid-Bollinger Band. A break above $93,000 could target $98,000–$100,600, while losing trendline support risks $88,800–$86,800.

A break below this support could see a move towards $80,643.41.  📊 WhiteBIT Chart: BTC/USDT (1D)  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"371842767","id":19575,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T12:40:04.758Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T12:40:04.758Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T12:35:00.101Z","text_content":"⚡Flash News\n\n🔗 Revolut and Trust Wallet launch zero-fee crypto buys\n\nRevolut partners with Trust Wallet to offer instant Bitcoin and crypto purchases in the EU with a self-custody model.\n\n#Revolut #TrustWallet #Bitcoin #EU  $TWT  $BTC","gravity_id":"371845896","id":19576,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T12:40:04.884Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T12:40:04.884Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T12:33:00.109Z","text_content":"$BTC i didn't learn from mistakes, i refined them","gravity_id":"371843124","id":19577,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T12:40:05.038Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T12:40:05.038Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T12:32:48.721Z","text_content":"$BTC  Weekly Chart\r \r #BTC   #ETH","gravity_id":"371844851","id":19578,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T12:40:05.249Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T12:40:05.249Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T12:32:27.996Z","text_content":"$BTC  22 December will be the day of beginning","gravity_id":"371842756","id":19579,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T12:40:05.451Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T12:40:05.451Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T12:49:59.083Z","text_content":"$BTC Saturday 13 big big cypber attack coming","gravity_id":"371844955","id":19585,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T12:50:04.216Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T12:50:04.216Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T12:47:22.750Z","text_content":"You check the price 50 times a day hoping something changed.

Seriously, guys…\n\nKraken was long seen as a safe and professional crypto platform, popular among major investors. But fees are unnecessarily high: high withdrawal costs and wide spreads. Competitors like Crypto, Finst, and Mexc show how it’s done: low transaction fees, attractive bundles, and no endless forms or hassles.\n\nAt Kraken, users sometimes face ridiculous rules. Get rejected from a bundle? Then you’re barred from investing for 180 days. But before those 180 days are up, you suddenly get an email to retake the test. One wrong answer – for example, your income – and you’re rejected again. Then you get a PDF saying you’re rejected, with no explanation why. Absolutely ridiculous.\n\nKraken may look professional, but these procedures make them look foolish and cost them customers. Seriously consider alternatives like Crypto, Finst, or Mexc for hassle-free investing.\n\n\n---\n\nStrategy for These Uncertain Times\n\nListen up: these are uncertain times, but we stay positive. Here’s my approach:\n\n50% in the Top 10 crypto bundle on Crypto – prevents impulsive positions and offers stable growth, around 4.5% yield.\n\n50% on Finst – keeps flexibility; you can quickly sell part of your holdings if needed, plus staking rewards of about 1% on the bundle. This combines stable growth with flexibility.\n\n10–15% of your total portfolio in gold for stability.\n\nSpeculative positions: a few small trades, max 5–10% of your total crypto portfolio.\n\n\nIgnore the noise. Stay calm, build your portfolio, and stick to your long-term strategy. This way, you combine stability, flexibility, and growth opportunities without getting frustrated by platforms that make investing unnecessarily complicated.","gravity_id":"371847094","id":19647,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T13:20:05.275Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T13:20:05.275Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T13:14:04.102Z","text_content":"🇬🇧 UK Makes Stablecoins and Crypto $BTC  2026 Priority  The UK is doubling down on digital finance!

Markets front-ran it hard, with Bitcoin pushing toward $94k-$95k in the days before on hopes of easier money boosting risk assets like crypto.  But today, we're seeing a classic \"sell the news\" reaction. $BTC  is down around 2-2.5%, trading near $90k-$92k, and ETH is off over 3-4%. The cut was fully priced in (over 90% odds), so no big surprise there. What spooked traders was Powell's press conference, he sounded pretty cautious. Inflation is still sticky above 2%, the job market is softening but not crashing, and the new dot plot shows only one more cut projected for all of 2026 (down from earlier hopes of more). Some Fed members even dissented, wanting to pause already.  Short term, this hawkish vibe is weighing on stocks and crypto alike. Risk appetite is cooling, with tech dragging and AI worries adding pressure. We could see BTC retrace further to $88k or even low $80ks if sentiment stays weak, similar quick 5-10% dips happened right after the September and October cuts.  Longer term, the picture is still positive. Lower rates overall make holding cash less attractive, and with no hikes on the horizon, liquidity should support crypto over time. Institutional ETF flows remain steady, and dips like this have been bought aggressively in past cycles, leading to higher grinds (think post-cut rallies earlier this year). Many analysts still eye $100k by year-end if we stabilize.  If you're holding, expect some chop and maybe tighten stops around $88k-$90k. If waiting on the sidelines, these pullbacks could be good entry spots for the bigger upside. FOMC reactions are always volatile, don't FOMO chase the top or panic sell the dip.

A $BTC  and crypto trading prop firm is a company that provides BTC and crypto traders with trading capital they can use.

With HyroTrader, a crypto prop firm, the profit target is up to 15%.  2/ Once you pass the challenge by achieving the profit target, you become a funded trader.  3/ Once funded, you trade the funded account the prop firm provides you and keep a percentage of the profits you make on it. With HyroTrader, traders keep up to 90% of the profits earned.  4/ If you are consistently profitable, the crypto prop firm you are trading with gives you more capital; this is called scaling.  #Bitcoin  #BTC","gravity_id":"371847798","id":19866,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T15:10:06.208Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T15:10:06.208Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T15:07:15.324Z","text_content":"You're bullish because you're stuck.

As part of the #SocialMining initiative with the @DAOLabs, I’ve seen how XPoll embodies Terranova’s vision of structured innovation built from unformed ideas.\n\nTerranova’s worldview is grounded in ambiguity, systems thinking, and the freedom to explore concepts before they become products. His work at Canvas Labs demonstrates a philosophy that treats early ideas as open systems rather than fixed propositions, laying the foundation for XPoll.\n\nCanvas Labs functions as a space for ideas that lack structure but contain potential. Terranova works with sparks instead of polished roadmaps, giving experimentation room to unfold before direction solidifies. His multidisciplinary background in law, business, agriculture, engineering, and blockchain allows him to view problems as interconnected systems rather than isolated challenges.\n\nXPoll reflects several principles drawn directly from this approach:\n\n➣ Exploration before definition\n➣ Systems thinking instead of linear planning\n➣ Comfort with ambiguity\n➣ Cross-disciplinary problem solving\n➣ Structural freedom for early ideas\n\nThese principles shape XPoll as a civic intelligence marketplace. The platform organizes abundant, unstructured public insight into structured intelligence with cryptographic verification. Using #Web3 infrastructure and behavioral data models, XPoll turns raw input into actionable knowledge. As Canvas Labs converts sparks into systems, XPoll translates collective sentiment into a reliable, interpretable resource for analysts and communities.","gravity_id":"371852750","id":20165,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T17:40:04.845Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T17:40:04.845Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T17:37:52.148Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $BTC","gravity_id":"371852745","id":20166,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T17:40:05.055Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T17:40:05.055Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T17:37:45.141Z","text_content":"📊 Bitcoin ETFs surge with $223.5M net inflows, marking the strongest performance since Nov. 21, following the Fed’s 25bps interest rate cut announcement.
