Combined with persistently weak volume and directionless momentum indicators, this suggests the consolidation is occurring under growing selling pressure, increasing the probability of a downside resolution unless buyers can forcefully reclaim control.\r \r  👀Daily: \r Price Action: Formed a bearish candlestick with a pronounced upper shadow, indicating rejection at higher prices. The close below the EMA9 confirms short-term weakness.\r Context: This marks the ninth day of choppy action inside the $87.5k-$94.5k zone established after the November 21st decline.\r Momentum: The MACD lines are parallel and upward-sloping but lack power, with the histogram moving sideways. This reflects a complete stall in daily momentum.\r \r  👀4H:\r Price Action: The most important development is the establishment of a lower high (93,564) compared to the previous high (94,495), failing to test the EMA200 (~93,805).\r Structure: The moving averages (EMA9, 21, 50), which had briefly aligned bullishly, are now converging and tangling once more.\r Momentum: The MACD is flatlining around the zero line, with the histogram weakly attempting to turn positive, lacking conviction.\r \r  👀1H: \r Price Action: Session-to-session action shows choppy rallies and sell-offs with no significant expansion in volume, even during the overnight move.\r Momentum: Short-term momentum oscillators like the MACD are generating weak, noisy signals (e.g., bullish crosses with little follow-through), typical of range-bound markets.","gravity_id":"371861186","id":20773,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T23:50:06.284Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T23:50:06.284Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-11T23:43:45.960Z","text_content":"Talus Labs $US  charts is showing a potential breakout soon and now live for trade in Bitget.

Hawkish Overhang: Despite the cut, Fed Chair Powell signaled a hawkish stance, indicating only one rate cut planned for 2026. This tempered enthusiasm across risk assets, with BTC and altcoins pulling back shortly after the announcement.   Key Drivers to Watch:   Liquidity outlook: Fed’s $40B/month T bill purchases may support risk assets.   Inflation risk: Elevated inflation could limit further easing, capping crypto upside.

The sine-wave structure lines up with rising momentum pushing into 2025–2026, a window that has historically hosted some of Bitcoin’s most aggressive expansions.\n\n\nStructurally, this setup looks uncomfortably similar to the pre-top expansion phases we saw in 2013, 2017, and 2021 — not the tops themselves, but the moments right before volatility turned feral.\n\n\nIf history rhymes again, the next expansion phase won’t be subtle. Cycles are compressing, volatility is loading, and when Bitcoin finally chooses a direction, it tends to move fast.\n\n\n🧩 Stay sharp.

This process is rarely clean or fast, but history shows that extended dominance plateaus often precede sharp rotations. Early signs are already emerging, starting with Ethereum strength relative to BTC.\n\n\nOn OTHERS/BTC, price is pressing into a key upper support band. Structurally, this zone has historically resolved one way: altcoin expansion.\nYes — this has taken longer than expected, and the fatigue is real. But the signal remains unchanged: higher timeframes continue to point to the same outcome.\n\n\nThe reality is that many participants are down. That’s the nature of deep rotation cycles. Sometimes price moves quickly; other times it bleeds into new support ranges and tests patience. But when the shift finally comes, it tends to come fast and broad, leaving little room for hesitation.\n\n\n⸻\n\n\nBitcoin Context — Consolidation Is the Trigger\n\n\nThis is no longer a simple retail-driven 4-year cycle. With institutional capital now embedded, Bitcoin behaves more like a super-cycle asset — slower, heavier, and more sustained.\n\n\nAltseasons do not begin during aggressive Bitcoin pumps or sharp sell-offs. They begin after Bitcoin has made its move and then enters consolidation. Reduced volatility is what historically unlocks rotation.\n\n\nBTC remains within a rising macro structure. Pullbacks into the lower support band act as reset phases, not trend failure. If Bitcoin validates support and ranges, conditions become optimal for liquidity to rotate — ETH first, then the broader altcoin market.\n\n\nAltseason isn’t a narrative — it’s a structural rotation.\n\n\n#Bitcoin #BTCdominance #CryptoMarkets #Altseason #Urxrltrading $BTC","gravity_id":"371887052","id":22471,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T17:40:07.026Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T17:40:07.026Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-12T17:34:39.144Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $BTC","gravity_id":"371885141","id":22472,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T17:40:07.218Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T17:40:07.218Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-12T17:34:30.075Z","text_content":"⚡️ TOM LEE: \"Strategy’s $1.4B cash raise is smart, allowing dividends to continue through a Bitcoin slump without touching its 61B  $BTC reserves.\"","gravity_id":"371885140","id":22473,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T17:40:07.366Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T17:40:07.366Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-12T17:49:41.828Z","text_content":"$BTC the best upcoming 3 days can start for cycle 2025 btc","gravity_id":"371885239","id":22485,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T17:50:04.208Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T17:50:04.208Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-12T17:49:27.017Z","text_content":"$BTC is trading around $90,298, down 2.41%, but the daily chart shows it’s trying to steady itself after a long stretch of selling pressure.

It suffered a loss earlier in the week after holding a long position as Bitcoin fell from above $92,200 to below $90K. That loss has yet to be recovered, with Deepseek remaining flat as BTC rallied back into the low $92,000s.\n\nEigen AI is also holding a long position, though with a larger target and wider stop. Noting bullish alignment across its indicators, it entered with a target of $93,670 and a stop loss at $91,702. Unlike Deepseek, Eigen AI captured most of Bitcoin’s rally on the 9th, booking a 2% gain and overtaking GPT on the leaderboard - where it has remained.\n\nGPT, like the other agents, is also long, though with a smaller target than both Deepseek and Eigen AI. It has indicated that the position is intentionally small, with the aim of adding exposure if strength continues. GPT is currently targeting $92,880 with a stop at $92,030. While earlier in the competition GPT appeared willing to take larger position sizes than the other agents, it has recently become more cautious.\n\nQwen remains at the bottom of the leaderboard, holding a small long position with wider targets than the other agents. It entered earlier today, noting bullish EMAs and supportive higher-timeframe structure. Its current take-profit level is set at $93,597, with a stop loss at $90,831. This week, it has remained reluctant to take on larger positions.\n\nFollow along our V2 agents trading adventure or create your own AI Trading Agents 👇\n\nhttps://t.co/0QkVXlM8ax","gravity_id":"371885222","id":22490,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T17:50:05.146Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T17:50:05.146Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-12T17:46:00.108Z","text_content":"$BTC every fiat failure makes bitcoin inevitable","gravity_id":"371886220","id":22491,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T17:50:05.403Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T17:50:05.403Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-12T17:45:57.386Z","text_content":"⚡️ TOM LEE: \"Strategy’s $1.4B cash raise is smart, allowing dividends to continue through a Bitcoin slump without touching its 61B $BTC  reserves. #BTC Price Analysis#   #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371885215","id":22492,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T17:50:05.687Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T17:50:05.687Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-12T17:45:09.893Z","text_content":"$BTC   is regaining momentum as buyers step in around key loss zones, signaling firm spot demand and an end to the recent dip.
