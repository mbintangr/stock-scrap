Spot support exists, but short-term conditions remain unstable.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nMarket Summary\n ・BTC remains unstable in the low $90K range. A roughly $2,000 drop occurred in a short time window, triggering a spike in long liquidations.\n ・The so-called “U.S. market open liquidity hunt” resurfaced, with leverage positions targeted rather than a fundamental repricing.\n ・BOJ rate-hike expectations (around Dec 19) continue to act as a convenient risk-off catalyst.\n ・At the same time, strong accumulation is observed around the $91K level, suggesting dips are being absorbed by conviction buyers.\n ・Clear regional flow divergence: selling led by Binance/OKX versus net buying on Coinbase, where U.S. whales continue to accumulate.\n ・ETH faces stronger short-term selling pressure, making upside attempts vulnerable to pullbacks.\n ・On the structural side, U.S. crypto firms are steadily moving into the regulated banking framework, signaling a shift from “peripheral” to “core” financial infrastructure.\n ・Year-end short-term Treasury purchases continue, providing a liquidity backstop for risk assets.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOn-Chain & Technical Trends\n ・BTC: Elevated open interest combined with sharp drops creates a liquidation-driven environment, prone to fast moves in both directions.\n ・BTC: The $90K level is a key psychological and liquidity pivot—losing it accelerates downside, holding it invites short covering.\n ・BTC: Accumulation near $91K suggests base building; sharp sell-offs tend to be absorbed, though rebounds remain volatile.\n ・Order book conditions: Thin liquidity during off-hours increases the likelihood of stop-hunts.\n ・ETH: A surge in taker sell volume raises short-term downside risk.\n ・ETH: Continued exchange outflows could reduce selling pressure, but persistence needs confirmation.\n ・Strategy implication: Favor spot exposure, reduce leverage. Staggered limit buys and partial profit-taking are more effective than chasing price.\n ・Key watchpoints: Pace of OI reduction and whether spot buying absorbs the next sell-off.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nSentiment\n ・Fatigue is building around “news-driven” liquidation moves, causing short-term traders to step back.\n ・BOJ tightening expectations revive memories of past drawdowns, encouraging preemptive de-risking.\n ・Conversely, institutional integration and infrastructure progress support medium- to long-term sentiment.\n ・U.S. equities remain strong while BTC lags, reinforcing a temporary split in capital allocation.\n ・The mood is less fear than “cautious distrust.” Upside chasing is weak, but dip-buying interest remains.\n ・Conclusion: Defense first. Avoid forcing trades until volatility compresses.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nTraditional U.S. Markets\n ・Ongoing year-end Treasury bill purchases help stabilize dollar liquidity conditions.\n ・Regulatory progress continues as crypto firms integrate into the U.S. financial system across custody, payments, and stablecoins.\n ・Equities remain risk-on, while crypto experiences liquidation-driven, asset-specific shocks.\n ・BOJ-related rate dynamics can spill into global risk assets, especially via yen carry trade sensitivities.\n ・Conclusion: Liquidity is a medium-term tailwind, but short-term price action remains hostage to events and positioning.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOverall Assessment\nIn the short term, the combination of thin liquidity, deliberate leverage hunts, and BOJ rate-hike expectations keeps conditions fragile, justifying a score of 38 (mild downtrend).\nAt the same time, strong spot accumulation around $91K, continued institutional integration in the U.S., and year-end liquidity support provide a constructive medium-term foundation.\nKey focus today: the $90K BTC battle, the pace of open-interest cleanup, and whether sell-offs continue to be absorbed by spot buyers.","gravity_id":"371891232","id":22917,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T21:30:05.751Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T21:30:05.751Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-12T21:22:45.051Z","text_content":"Cross-chain always felt like a hack.

Each time, it preceded a drastic move that didn’t just continue the trend — it accelerated it.    Based on where price and structure sit today, my best estimate is that it will take another three to five weeks for this pattern to fully mature. The fact that it’s already visible gives us something rare in this market: time to prepare instead of react.    In today’s $BTC  analysis, I’ll walk you through what this pattern is, why it matters for the macro trend, how it has played out historically, and what I’m doing now to position ahead of it. I’ll also cover what would invalidate it and outline realistic targets in both directions so you can plan accordingly.    There's a ton of alpha in this one.

We can clearly see heavy liquidation zones forming below $86,600 and above $98,425.   These areas are critical because they represent regions where a large number of leveraged positions could be forced to close, potentially triggering sharp volatility. Price often gravitates toward such liquidity pools before showing a reaction  either a bounce due to aggressive buying/selling or a continuation if liquidity is fully absorbed.   In short, $86,600 and $98,425 are key reaction zones, and how BTC behaves around them will likely define the next directional move.  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"371899668","id":23538,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T07:00:06.148Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T07:00:06.148Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-13T06:55:12.406Z","text_content":"$BTC Looking bullish $hoot...

On-chain, exchange reserves are at multi-year lows, signaling supply tightness, but demand remains muted, volatility expansion looks imminent. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371911942","id":24466,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T17:10:06.848Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T17:10:06.848Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-13T17:03:19.175Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $BTC","gravity_id":"371913134","id":24467,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T17:10:07.103Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T17:10:07.103Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-13T17:20:00.160Z","text_content":"$BTC my strategy: cope until proven profitable","gravity_id":"371913259","id":24477,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T17:20:06.083Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T17:20:06.083Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-13T17:19:22.760Z","text_content":"$BTC  orderbook is stacked with strong bids around the $88,000-$90,000 level.

The $BTC  MVRV Z-Score is sitting around 0.6, historically a transition zone — not a cycle top. In past cycles, major bull runs began when the Z-Score rebounded from these low-to-neutral levels, as volatility shook out weak hands while smart money accumulated quietly.  This is not euphoric territory. Historical tops occurred above Z-Score levels of 7+, and we are far from that zone. What we’re seeing instead is mid-cycle compression before expansion.

The curve tilts toward a single settlement date, Dec. 26, 2025, and the strikes with the heaviest traffic form a shelf around $100,000, with call exposure stepping higher in neat increments above that round number.  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  $PI","gravity_id":"371913461","id":24549,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T18:00:05.457Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T18:00:05.457Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-13T17:53:00.098Z","text_content":"$BTC fiat creates dependencies. bitcoin creates independence","gravity_id":"371914439","id":24550,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T18:00:05.710Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T18:00:05.710Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-13T17:52:45.051Z","text_content":"Bitcoin Mining Profitability Check: At BTC $90,126, you're earning $0.0382/day per TH/s.\n\nThis is a marginal dip from last week's $0.0391.\n\nMarket dynamics shift; optimizing your hashpower strategy is key to maximizing returns.\n\nStay agile.","gravity_id":"371914437","id":24551,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T18:00:06.016Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T18:00:06.016Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-13T17:52:38.563Z","text_content":"You sold the bottom.

It's painful but I think patience remains the move here.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Meme Alpha#","gravity_id":"371913451","id":24553,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T18:00:06.442Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T18:00:06.442Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-13T17:51:53.318Z","text_content":"$BTC digital labubu","gravity_id":"371915249","id":24554,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T18:00:06.704Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T18:00:06.704Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-13T17:51:27.752Z","text_content":"$BTC   $55 billion options market is now obsessing over one specific date that forces a $100k showdown The options curve is loaded for Dec. 26—and the unwind after.  ﻿$ZEC  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371915245","id":24555,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T18:00:07.659Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T18:00:07.659Z"}]
