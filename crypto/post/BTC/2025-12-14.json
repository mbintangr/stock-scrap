Historically, price surged first, retail FOMO followed, and on-chain congestion peaked near cycle tops. This time, congestion and fee pressure appeared at the very start of the cycle — aligned with the launch of BlackRock’s IBIT spot ETF.  KEY DIFFERENCE:  - Early demand came from institutions via ETFs, not retail on-chain speculation  - Institutions front-loaded exposure, instead of chasing late-cycle momentum  - On-chain congestion peaked early, reflecting structural positioning, not euphoria  - Price expansion followed with muted retail participation  - The ETF era didn’t end the cycle — it started it.  This isn’t a late-stage retail bubble. It’s early institutional positioning marking Bitcoin’s maturation phase.","gravity_id":"371914453","id":24548,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T18:00:05.207Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T18:00:05.207Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-13T17:54:03.882Z","text_content":"$BTC   options market is large, liquid, and (at the moment) unusually concentrated.

If BTC can stabilize above $90,000 within the next 24 hours, the bullish structure stays alive and we can look for a continuation toward $97,000 and then $100,000.  If BTC fails to hold $90,000, the door opens for a deeper decline and the first downside target becomes the $78,000 demand zone. This is the point where the next major direction gets decided. https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/GojJub2b-BTC-USDT-Hold-90K-or-Prepare-for-a-Heavy-Flush-Let-s-See/   If you need capital for trades but don’t want to sell your crypto, CoinRabbit is worth a look.

Yet  Bitcoin is now tradable through spot ETFs at Vanguard - but that hasn’t changed how the firm views $BTC .

In his words, it lacks the three things Vanguard looks for: income, cash flow, and long-term compounding.  That contrast is telling. Vanguard offers access, but not conviction.

Here’s why BTC may still have room to rewrite its ATH:  ▪️ This cycle hasn’t shown the usual parabolic blow-off yet. ▪️ The market structure has changed - most capital now flows through ETFs and corporate treasuries, not retail hype. ▪️ The macro backdrop for crypto looks more supportive than in past cycles.

Key Takeaways:  Stablecoins dominate crypto spending, with USDC, USDT, and EURI leading the way, while $BTC  is less commonly used for purchases.  WhiteBIT Nova, a crypto debit card, processed over €50 million in transactions, with users spending between €500 to €1000 per month.  81% of users prefer virtual cards over physical ones, reflecting the increasing trend of mobile-first financial behavior.  Europe’s embrace of digital financial tools is growing, especially in countries like Spain, Italy, Ireland, Poland, and Netherlands, where crypto payments are becoming routine. Stablecoins are preferred for daily spending, while cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are primarily used for long-term holdings.

A pullback to the 50 EMA is possible, and if it happens, I’ll add more shorts.\n\nAs you can see, the yellow line has been BTC’s biggest resistance since 2018.

What followed? Another accumulation phase that lasted more than 1.5 years before the next expansion.\n\nNow look at the present. BTC has once again hit the same resistance trendline and is getting rejected. History is repeating, not rhyming.\n\nIn my view, 75–72K is the last major support.

Talus Network and BeatSwap launched Dec. 11! Alpha market cap hits $15.001B! Fear & Greed Index stuck at 29 as Bitcoin dominance holds 58.9%!\n\nLet's examine this week's Alpha developments.🧵\n\n1/7\n📈 Market Overview\n\nBinance Alpha market cap stands at $15.001B with $8.422B in trading volume. Alpha maintains listing pace with two Dec. 11 launches despite broader market weakness. Total crypto market cap fell 0.51% to $3.15T as Bitcoin dominance held at 58.9%, pulling liquidity from altcoins while creating lower entry opportunities for Alpha participants.\n\n2/7\n🏆 Top Performers\n\n7-Day Gainers:\n🔹 DOYR: +5,891.47% to $0.004715, $4.7M market cap, $21.5M volume\n🔹 @mindnetwork_xyz Mind Network: +191.84% to $0.04551, $15.97M market cap, $14.4M volume\n🔹 @PowerPrtcl Power Protocol: +172.38% to $0.2205, $46.3M market cap, $32.1M volume\n🔹 SentismAI (SENTIS): +90.66% to $0.1804, $35.36M market cap, $119.3M volume\n🔹 pippin (PIPPIN): +78.62% to $0.3297, $329.7M market cap, $64.7M volume\n\n3/7\n💼 How to Participate in Binance Alpha\n\n🔹 Earn Alpha Points through holding/trading eligible tokens (15-day rolling window)\n🔹 Check requirements when projects launch. Recent benchmarks range from 140 points (Infinity Ground) to 241 points (BeatSwap).\n🔹 Redeem points on the Alpha Events page once trading begins\n🔹 Confirm claims within announced timeframes or forfeit eligibility\n\n4/7\n⚠️ Extended Fear Territory\n\nThe CMC Fear & Greed Index sits at 29/100, down one point in 24 hours but up two from last week's 27, extending the multi-week fear streak. Three factors drove the sell-off: Bitcoin's rejection below $103,000 triggered $164.19M in liquidations over 24 hours, open interest climbed 4.77% to $841.1B while funding rates spiked 15.48%, and social sentiment scored 4.9/10 as institutional adoption narratives clashed with exchange security concerns.\n\n5/7\n⚡ Two Dec. 11 Listings Launch\n\n🔹 @Talus_Labs Talus Network (US) launched as first platform listing with 236 Alpha Points required for airdrop\n🔹 @BeatXswap BeatSwap (BTX) debuted as first global listing with 241 Alpha Points required\n🔹 Both launches maintain Alpha's aggressive distribution pace despite market weakness\n\n6/7\n💡 Key Takeaways\n\n🔹 Track your rolling 15-day point balance as inactivity directly reduces participation eligibility\n🔹 Monitor post-listing price action for DOYR and Mind Network as 100%+ weekly gainers often face profit-taking pressure\n🔹 Watch for Fear & Greed Index movement toward 50+ neutral territory as potential rally catalyst\n\nStay informed, stay ahead:\nhttps://t.co/kiGWxvisNt\n\n7/7","gravity_id":"371925685","id":25367,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T06:10:07.410Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T06:10:07.410Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T06:01:43.573Z","text_content":"The market made a new high.

A strong reaction there could spark a relief bounce, while failure to hold may extend the pullback. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"371927413","id":25489,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T07:50:05.669Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T08:00:08.062Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T07:48:18.736Z","text_content":"$BTC  90K was the reason 2025 the increase in just 6 days to 109.5K+","gravity_id":"371927409","id":25490,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T07:50:05.930Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T08:00:08.319Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T07:46:45.044Z","text_content":"CME just hiked #silver margins 10% into a spike, and there are built-in price limits that can halt trading when silver moves ‘too far, too fast.’ On paper it’s called ‘risk management,’ but in practice it slows and caps upside in a key monetary asset right when it starts exposing fiat stress.\n\nNotice how the system works:\n– When silver rips up, they hike margins and halt trading.\n– When silver dumps, there’s no ‘too far, too fast’ protection.\n\nThat’s not neutral risk management.

The most notable development is the across-the-board loss of upward momentum, evidenced by sequentially shrinking MACD histograms on daily, 4-hour, and 1-hour charts. This consolidation is characterized by weak volume and price action trapped below short-term moving averages, suggesting it is occurring under distribution rather than accumulation, increasing the probability of a downward resolution.  Daily:  Price Action & Structure: Closed with a minimal bullish doji on contracting volume, failing to overcome the resistance posed by the previous day's long upper shadow. The price remains confined below the EMA9. Moving Averages: The EMA9 and EMA21 are running nearly parallel with a narrow gap, offering no clear directional bias but defining immediate resistance. Momentum: While the fast and slow lines remain above zero and pointed upwards, they are moving parallel without divergence. Critically, the bullish histogram bars are sequentially decreasing, signaling a clear loss of bullish momentum.  4H: Price Action: Trading in a tight, low-volatility range consistently suppressed by the EMA9. The EMA21 and EMA50 are intertwined above, forming a confluence of resistance. Momentum: The indicator is located below the zero line. Its lines are pointing downwards in a near-parallel manner but show early signs of convergence. The bearish histogram bars are sequentially decreasing, indicating the selling momentum is also decelerating within the downtrend.  1H:  Price Action: Continued narrow consolidation below the EMA9. All key EMAs (9, 21, 50) are compressed together in a bearish alignment, reflecting a complete lack of short-term trend.","gravity_id":"371928160","id":25506,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T08:00:07.572Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T08:00:07.572Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T08:09:40.317Z","text_content":"$BTCFVG Loading 🤏📈📈🔥","gravity_id":"371928337","id":25517,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T08:10:05.360Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T08:10:05.360Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T08:08:06.670Z","text_content":"$BTC  check-in Two weeks into December and Bitcoin is basically flat.

The firm cites strong structural demand and sticky institutional buying, suggesting an “elongated bull cycle”   that departs from the traditional four-year pattern.  Other bullish voices include: • Mike Alfred: BTC $315K in 2026 • Tom Lee (Fundstrat): BTC $250K in the coming months  Technical analysts caution that Bitcoin’s price has broken key long-term parallel channels, signaling a potential new bear phase. Critical support zones are now near $70.5K, and failure to reclaim them could deepen selling pressure.

If you’re already active in crypto, this feels like something worth checking out.\n\nAre you planning to explore this listing or just watch how it plays out?","gravity_id":"371935731","id":25919,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T12:00:09.954Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T12:00:09.954Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T12:08:06.711Z","text_content":"SPOT Signal Hit\n#Cvx / Usdt Perfect Hit \nAlhamdulillah Hit First targets 😍😍😍😍\nTP1 HIT ✅✅✅✅✅✅\ntapa tap tapa tap profit 1 Day 6 Hours ⏰ 😍\nABSOLUTELY KILLING IT!!!! 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑\nEnjoy My Guys Profit ENjoy Karo😍😍😍😍\nNew signal coming soon\nProfit From This Signal : 10.5562%📈\n\n\n $BTC  $ETH","gravity_id":"371932770","id":25928,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T12:10:02.896Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T12:10:06.680Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T12:10:03.784Z","text_content":"$BTC  ...i have a dream...🤣 Merry christmas and a happy new year to all in Cryptouniverse 🎅🤶","gravity_id":"371932782","id":25930,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T12:10:05.686Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T12:10:05.686Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T12:09:40.438Z","text_content":"I'm bearish on $BTC  😎👇  The ETF collapse is coming.

Heading into January, that’s when I’d expect volumes and liquidity to return, giving $BTC  a better chance to choose a clear and meaningful direction.  ﻿Join us on Telegram: t.me/AlphaCryptoSignal  ﻿#CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#  #CMC Smart Quests#  #Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371938338","id":26107,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T13:50:07.979Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T13:50:07.979Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T13:46:45.087Z","text_content":"The ultimate Bitcoin neobank is here.\n\n@Sat_Pay lets you earn on Bitcoin, borrow against it, and spend with a debit card.\n\nAll in one app. All without selling.\n\nJoin the waitlist, win BTC 👇\nhttps://satpay.mobilum.com/ ","gravity_id":"371933623","id":26108,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T13:50:08.355Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T13:50:08.355Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T13:46:33.780Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $BTC","gravity_id":"371938329","id":26109,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T13:50:08.621Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T13:50:08.621Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T13:46:26.457Z","text_content":"I’m bearish on $BTC","gravity_id":"371933622","id":26110,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T13:50:08.879Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T13:50:08.879Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T13:46:11.348Z","text_content":"$BTC Will soon  have the most growth in Desember ( JESSE/SOL )👀🐬 link bio\nCa 3kuNn3zmoWMxPmJkDjEtWhVXa8Nsg7yuJiDDBc13XhvH","gravity_id":"371933619","id":26111,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T13:50:09.137Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T13:50:09.137Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T13:46:00.094Z","text_content":"$BTC i don't fear losing money, i fear confirming i had no idea what i was doing","gravity_id":"371936400","id":26112,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T13:50:09.453Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T13:50:09.453Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T13:45:43.833Z","text_content":"You set price alerts.

No manifesto, no grand vision, not even a \"good luck.\"\n\nThe moment he disappeared, he completed the institutional loop—transitioning from technical decentralization to the decentralization of cognition and authority.\n\nIn terms of human evolution, the creator of new production relations stands far above the creator of productive forces. He saw clearly that once \"trust\" becomes a prerequisite for a system, that system is destined to collapse (sustained only by massive friction costs until it does).\n\nSo, he created a new set of production relations, stripping trust from the institution. His system is self-consistent, relying solely on game theory and mathematics. Almost single-handedly, he enabled a quantum leap in human production relations. In my view, his influence rivals that of the Code of Hammurabi—codifying power into law/grammar.\n\nThe Bitcoin in his wallets is now worth up to $100 billion, yet not a single satoshi has ever moved.\n\nOver the past decade, I have repeatedly pondered the few words he left behind. His insight, restraint, execution, character, and demeanor move me deeply and have benefited me for a lifetime.\n\nI originally intended to add my own commentary to each quote.

This suggests that new positions are being added, often a precursor to heightened volatility 📊  \r \r At the same time, there is a clear divergence between institutional and retail behavior. While retail-heavy exchanges like Binance and OKX see growing Open Interest, CME exposure is declining, signaling institutional caution. This imbalance often appears ahead of liquidity-driven price moves ⚠️  \r \r The Binance liquidation map reveals a heavy concentration of short liquidations stacked above the current price, especially at higher leverage levels. This creates a favorable environment for a short squeeze, where even a modest upward move could trigger cascading liquidations 🔥  \r \r On the downside, long liquidation clusters below price are comparatively thinner, implying limited short-term downside pressure unless a strong bearish catalyst emerges.  \r \r The combination of rising Open Interest and dominant short-side liquidity above price indicates a fragile market structure. Such conditions are often exploited by large players to push price into liquidity pools before a clearer trend develops 🧠\r \r  In summary, Bitcoin is entering a high-volatility phase, with a higher probability of an upward liquidity sweep first, followed by a decisive directional move 📈⚡  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"371938527","id":26180,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T14:30:07.023Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T14:30:07.023Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T14:26:00.151Z","text_content":"$BTC some people visualize success, i visualize liquidation prices","gravity_id":"371937573","id":26182,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T14:30:07.499Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T14:30:07.499Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T14:25:45.168Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nOn Polymarket, the probability of \"Bank of Japan 25 Basis Point Rate Hike in December\" is currently trading at 98%.\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"371938521","id":26183,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T14:30:07.697Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T14:30:07.697Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T14:25:45.070Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nA whale withdrew 14,098,000 WLFI from #Binance, equivalent to around $2.03 million\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"371938520","id":26184,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T14:30:08.010Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T14:30:08.010Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T14:25:45.066Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nFrom Wall Street to the World Cup: How Football Became Crypto’s Biggest Gateway Drug\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"371936599","id":26185,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T14:30:08.269Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T14:30:08.269Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T14:25:45.059Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nMichael Saylor republishes #Bitcoin Tracker information, hinting at additional $BTC purchase.\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"371933814","id":26186,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T14:30:08.531Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T14:30:08.531Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T14:40:00.139Z","text_content":"$BTC they said bear markets build character, i think i'm overqualified now","gravity_id":"371936662","id":26195,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T14:40:05.290Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T14:50:05.693Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T14:38:13.267Z","text_content":"$BTC see the bull again in the next 5 years.

Changes in Japan’s monetary policy add to short-term uncertainty, but this does not mean the crypto market is disappearing.\n\nPeriods like this often create the best opportunities. When prices are under pressure and sentiment is weak, strengthening a position and increasing staking exposure can significantly improve long-term returns. Higher staking levels allow investors to accumulate more while waiting for market conditions to normalize.\n\nYes, higher interest rates can temporarily reduce liquidity in the system. But that impact is short term. Capital doesn’t vanish — it rotates. Once the market adjusts, assets with strong fundamentals tend to recover first.\n\nThis is exactly the phase where disciplined, long-term investors act, while others react emotionally.","gravity_id":"371940294","id":26405,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T17:00:05.729Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T17:00:05.729Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T16:55:45.065Z","text_content":"U.S. government bond yields are pumping hard.\n\nThat's bad news for $BTC, It should fall a little bit to continue for bull run ","gravity_id":"371940292","id":26406,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T17:00:05.889Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T17:00:05.889Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T16:55:45.062Z","text_content":"Eric Trumps American Bitcoin (ABTC) increased their $BTC Reserves to 4,783 #Bitcoin this week.\n\nThay know whats coming ✌️ ","gravity_id":"371939535","id":26407,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T17:00:06.049Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T17:00:06.049Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T17:09:26.188Z","text_content":"🇸🇻 HUGE: After buying another 8 $BTC   this week, El Salvador now holds just over 7,500 $BTC .","gravity_id":"371940365","id":26414,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T17:10:05.346Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T17:10:05.346Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T17:08:57.640Z","text_content":"$BTC 15.12.25-22.12.25 dump","gravity_id":"371939601","id":26415,"createdAt":"2025-12-14T17:10:05.503Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-14T17:10:05.503Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-14T17:08:51.453Z","text_content":"🚨 **$BTC  IS STALLING — AND VOLATILITY SUPPRESSION IS THE REASON**\r \r According to Jeff Park, Bitcoin’s options data shows large holders consistently **selling call volatility**.
