These projects always tend to recover, which provides peace of mind and confidence. Of course, you might think: it can’t go lower, but markets can always drop further — as we are seeing now.\n\nUnexpected events can always occur, such as interest rate hikes or news that puts the market under pressure. Speculative positions are often hit harder because there is no certainty that they will recover. That’s why it’s so important to maintain a solid core of proven projects in your portfolio and limit speculative positions. This way, you can benefit from potential upside while always building on a strong foundation.\n\nAnother essential aspect of crypto investing is staying in the market. Keep staking, building, and strengthening your proven projects, and avoid unnecessary selling. This is the core of crypto investing: patience, discipline, and confidence in your strategy. By doing so, you never have to sell in panic and can steadily work toward long-term success.","gravity_id":"371976046","id":28894,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T19:00:05.845Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T19:00:05.845Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-15T18:58:11.788Z","text_content":"$BTC 60K on the way!","gravity_id":"371976037","id":28895,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T19:00:06.132Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T19:00:06.132Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-15T18:56:12.893Z","text_content":"As 06 Oct 2025, Snow prediction for a Bitcoin top at $125,219 price \n\nSnow said \"Sold BTC fully.

That is why every cycle resolves the same way — BTC dominance rolls over, OTHERS/BTC defends support, and capital rotates.\n\n\nThis is not the phase for chasing upside.\nIt’s the phase for identifying structural floors, waiting for Critical Support Reversals, and managing risk accordingly.\n\n\nThe charts are already there.\n\n\nThe outcome depends on what you do before they move. 💭\n\n\n#Crypto #Altcoins #BTCdominance #UrxrlTrading $BTC","gravity_id":"371982589","id":29356,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T23:20:05.884Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T23:30:07.809Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-15T23:16:39.691Z","text_content":"#Bitcoin  down 2% today but has recovered form the lows to stay just above the $86180 support (amazing how trend lines work!!).

Now NS is back live, and I’m running the same playbook, DCAing, stacking volume, and aiming for another BGB win. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371986299","id":29505,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T01:20:05.999Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T01:30:06.917Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T01:15:22.061Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $BTC  BTC Big Pump 💥🚀","gravity_id":"371985549","id":29506,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T01:20:06.277Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T01:30:07.112Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T01:14:28.573Z","text_content":"JUST IN: Billionaire Jack Dorsey's CashApp IS NOW GIVING AWAY FREE #BITCOIN  TO EVERYONE WHO SIGNS UP A NEW MERCHANT.     $BTC  IS BECOMING MONEY, LEGENDARY 🧡.  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371985543","id":29507,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T01:20:06.466Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T01:30:07.434Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T01:13:45.062Z","text_content":"🚨 ALERT: A Binance whale saw a $11.58M BTC/USDT long liquidated in one order as Bitcoin fell below $86,000.

Right now, the market is at a “decision point.” How BTC reacts here will likely set the tone for the next big move.  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"371986653","id":29567,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T02:20:06.249Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T02:30:08.199Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T02:13:46.050Z","text_content":"$BTC my vision bottom of a bitcoin will be December 17 through 19 December after that we’re going up until end of January and then a pull back and then off for the parabolic move.","gravity_id":"371986646","id":29568,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T02:20:06.556Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T02:20:06.556Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T02:13:12.245Z","text_content":"$BTC Bearish baby :(","gravity_id":"371986641","id":29569,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T02:20:06.795Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T02:20:06.795Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T02:13:00.110Z","text_content":"$BTC the first step to freedom is realizing your money is fake","gravity_id":"371985896","id":29570,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T02:20:07.014Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T02:20:07.014Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T02:11:47.440Z","text_content":"With Japanese rate hike on 18-19 Dec.

By focusing on liquidity pockets, mapping support and resistance, and timing entries carefully, smaller trades can compound into consistent results without exposing capital to outsized risk.  Recent examples highlight how modest buy volumes can qualify for structured rewards. In the ongoing Trading Club Championship Phase 21 on Bitget, the $ZETA  pair requires less than $10k in buy volume to participate, and even under $20k could still earn 30 BGB. This shows that opportunities exist for traders who prefer controlled exposure while still benefiting from event structures.

From a market structure perspective, Bitcoin printed a series of lower highs after peaking above the 93,500–94,000 region. That zone now stands out as a decisive macro resistance, where sellers consistently regained control. The rejection from that level triggered a sharp downside move, breaking the prior consolidation range around 90,000–91,000. The recent sell-off accelerated once 88,500 was lost, confirming a bearish continuation rather than a simple pullback.  The current price action suggests Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize above the 85,500–86,000 zone, which aligns with a prior demand area from late November. This region is acting as a short-term support, but the structure remains fragile. Any weak bounce that fails below 88,000 would likely be corrective rather than trend-reversing.  Looking at RSI (14), the indicator is deeply suppressed near 30, briefly dipping into oversold territory. While this can sometimes precede a technical bounce, RSI has not yet shown a meaningful bullish divergence. This implies that downside momentum may slow, but selling pressure has not fully exhausted itself.  The MACD (12,26) reinforces the bearish outlook. The histogram remains firmly negative, and the MACD line is below the signal line with widening separation. This configuration typically signals sustained bearish momentum on higher timeframes, suggesting that any upside move may face heavy resistance.  In the near term, a relief bounce toward 87,500–88,500 is possible, especially if short sellers take profits. However, this zone is expected to act as strong resistance. A daily close back above 90,000 would be required to neutralize the bearish structure.","gravity_id":"371989357","id":29853,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T05:40:07.141Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T05:40:07.141Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T05:37:47.798Z","text_content":"Sell when the indicator is above 80 buy when it’s below 20.

This is weak hands getting shaken out. That says nothing about the strength of the crypto market itself.\n\nRates up or down may affect timing, but not the bigger picture.

Real control over crypto market liquidity is now concentrated in the United States. The largest funds, ETF issuers, institutional players, and capital flows are based there. A small number of major players effectively dictate market direction — primarily through Bitcoin.\n\n\nThe key point is this: the crypto market we used to know no longer exists.\nIn the past, price action was driven largely by crowd psychology — fear, greed, and retail sentiment. That model is gone.\nToday’s market is dominated by algorithms, institutional capital, and centralized liquidity management.\n\n\nAltcoins make this especially clear. With very few exceptions, they no longer move independently.\nWhen Bitcoin rises, altcoins rise only marginally.\nWhen Bitcoin falls, altcoins collapse much harder and are used as the primary source of liquidations.\nThey behave less like independent assets and more like leveraged derivatives of BTC.\n\n\nIn reality, the current crypto market increasingly resembles a single centralized system controlled by a handful of multi-billion-dollar entities. And despite this concentration of power, there is virtually no effective oversight. Everything is justified under the banner of a “free market” — even though that free market effectively ended with the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024.\n\n\nETFs were a turning point. They brought institutional money into crypto, but at the same time destroyed equal conditions for retail traders. Retail is no longer trading against other people — it is trading against funds, algorithms, and machines with virtually unlimited liquidity.\n\n\nThis is why traditional market cycles feel broken today.\nIt’s not that the cycles failed — it’s that the market itself has fundamentally changed.","gravity_id":"371993569","id":30220,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T09:30:07.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T09:30:07.587Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T09:24:51.141Z","text_content":"🚨 NEW: Over the past 3 months,  $BTC has outperformed nearly every crypto sector, with average returns across the market lagging behind, showing a clear capital rotation and concentration into  $BTC, per @glassnode.\n\n#Altcoin Season# #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"371993563","id":30221,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T09:30:07.881Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T09:30:07.881Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T09:23:32.689Z","text_content":"$BTC  4 year cycle trends:  \r \r \r - #bitcoin  cycle lows appear in the first week of november\r \r - #bitcoin  cycle highs appear to be shortening by a month  \r \r \r based on this theory, the next cycle low would be the first week of november in 2026 and the cycle high would be the first week of september in 2029","gravity_id":"371994294","id":30222,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T09:30:08.164Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T09:30:08.164Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T09:40:00.118Z","text_content":"$BTC fiat rewards complacency. bitcoin rewards conviction","gravity_id":"371993720","id":30233,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T09:40:05.188Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T09:40:05.188Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T09:36:48.496Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $BTC","gravity_id":"371994431","id":30234,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T09:40:05.481Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T09:40:05.481Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T09:33:54.380Z","text_content":"🚨UPDATE: #Polymarket odds of Bitcoin hitting $80K by year-end rise to 41%, as $BTC trades near $86.2K after a sharp sell-off and tests key support around $85K.","gravity_id":"371994407","id":30235,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T09:40:05.764Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T09:40:05.764Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T09:33:42.812Z","text_content":"$BTC BTC is the biggest scam!

Once everyone’s watching the same risk… the easy part disappears   Do with that timing what you will. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #BNBChain#","gravity_id":"371995151","id":30340,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T10:30:07.012Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T10:30:07.012Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T10:23:54.281Z","text_content":"$BTC JUST IN : 🚨🚨💰 KindlyMD (NAKA) faces Nasdaq delisting risk after 30 straight closes below $1; firm holds 5,398 BTC (~$466M).","gravity_id":"371994890","id":30342,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T10:30:07.589Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T10:30:07.589Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T10:23:12.698Z","text_content":"$BTC ’s not confused — it’s just bored right now   Those sharp up-down moves aren’t momentum, they’re placeholders.

It's not a full-blown crash, more like a healthy pullback after the wild run-up earlier this year. On-chain data shows short-term holders and some whales dumping coins (realized profits and exchange inflows are up), while macro worries like potential Bank of Japan rate hikes are adding pressure on risk assets.  The big question is where it bounces or breaks next. Right now, the most important price zone to watch is $84,000-$85,000. That's a strong support area, lots of buyers stepped in there before, and it's where on-chain cost basis clusters sit. If $BTC  holds above $84k, we could see a quick rebound back toward $88k-$90k, especially with oversold indicators flashing (RSI at levels like past bottoms) and institutional ETF flows still positive overall.  But if it breaks below $84k cleanly, things get choppier, next major support is around $80k-$82k, where even more whale accumulation happened earlier. A drop there would shake out weak hands but could set up a stronger bottom for 2026.  Longer term, the setup stays bullish: lower Fed rates, steady corporate buying (like MicroStrategy adding more), and limited supply. These dips have been bought hard in 2025, don't panic sell. If you're holding, watch $84k closely; if sidelined, a test of that zone could be a solid entry for the next leg up. Stay calm, crypto loves volatility!  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"371998192","id":30357,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T10:40:06.407Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T10:50:07.911Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T10:36:10.129Z","text_content":"$BTC  extends sell-off, approaching December lows  📉 #Bitcoin  (BTC) continues its price correction, trading below $86,000 at the time of writing on Tuesday, marking its fifth consecutive day of decline.

On-chain data shows a clear increase in whale-related transfers, suggesting profit-taking after the recent rally and adding weight to the current pullback.  The most important zone to watch now sits between 82,000 and 85,000. This range has acted as a key demand area during previous corrections, with buyers stepping in to defend it. A sustained hold above this zone would indicate that the sell-off is corrective rather than a trend reversal.  If $BTC  fails to reclaim 85,000 on strong volume, downside risk increases. Below current levels, the next major support lies near 78,000 to 80,000, where longer-term holders have historically accumulated. A break into that range would likely trigger higher volatility but could also attract fresh spot demand.  For now, market direction depends on whether buyers can absorb ongoing whale selling. Stability within the current support zone would suggest consolidation, while a clean breakdown would shift focus to lower price levels in the days ahead.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #BTC","gravity_id":"371996369","id":30479,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T11:50:06.873Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T11:50:06.873Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T11:47:50.174Z","text_content":"$BTC  I use TekNikAnal AnaLysis broooo...","gravity_id":"371997601","id":30480,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T11:50:07.192Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T11:50:07.192Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T11:46:33.815Z","text_content":"•  $BTC when you say “I’ll use 100x, just this one time”\n• That face you make when liquidation is faster than your internet\n• Bulls smiling… until the red candle punches straight through support\n• Market said “no emotions allowed”, and meant it\n\nNow the important part traders should not ignore 👇\n\n• One big red candle can erase hours of patience — leverage respects no one\n• Emotional confidence before confirmation is how accounts disappear\n• When price drops vertically like this, it’s usually leverage getting wiped, not fundamentals dying\n• Risk management matters more than prediction — always\n• The market doesn’t care how sure you were\n\nLesson:\nIf the chart is squeezing your face like this image…\nYou’re probably overexposed 😌\n\nTrade smart.

Every major move up was followed by a deep pullback into strong demand before the next expansion...\nThe recent rejection near the top shows the same behavior again price pushed into resistance and sellers stepped in immediately.\nRight now, BTC is sitting below a major resistance zone. Until that level is reclaimed with strength, upside remains limited. The structure still shows lower highs, which means the market is not ready to fully turn bullish yet.\nOn the downside, there is a clear demand area below. If price loses the current support and closes cleanly below it, liquidity opens toward the lower range around the mid-to-high 70k area. That would be a normal pullback in a larger cycle, not the end of Bitcoin.\nFor a bullish continuation, the condition is simple: BTC must reclaim the previous high area and hold it with volume. Without that, calling 150k is just hope, not analysis.\nSo what’s the smart move?\nThis is not a clean long zone because we are under resistance.\nThis is not a clean short zone because we are near demand.\nThe best position right now is patience.\nBottom line Structure is still corrective\nBoth scenarios are possible\nConfirmation matters more than predictions\nEither BTC pulls back first to build a stronger base…\nOr it reclaims resistance and opens the path higher.\nUntil the chart decides, this is a wait-and-watch zone.\nLogic first.

The primary catalyst is a supply-side shock originating from China, and the timing of this development is critical.\r \r What Triggered the Decline?\r \r Chinese authorities have once again tightened restrictions on domestic Bitcoin mining operations. In December, enforcement intensified in regions with high mining concentration. Estimates suggest that approximately 400,000 mining units were shut down within a short period, creating an immediate disruption to the Bitcoin network.\r \r What the Data Is Showing\r \r The impact is already visible on-chain. Bitcoin’s network #hashrate  has declined by roughly 8%, reflecting the sudden loss of computing power as miners disconnected from the network. \r \r Why Miner Shutdowns Affect Price?\r \rWhen miners are abruptly forced offline, mining revenue drops instantly, however, operational costs such as electricity, logistics, and relocation still need to be covered. So some miners sell Bitcoin to generate liquidity, increasing short-term uncertainty across the #MARKET . This sequence creates real selling pressure.\r Importantly, this move does not reflect a breakdown in Bitcoin’s fundamentals, as the pressure is rooted in policy decisions and is not market weakness.\r \r Bitcoin has experienced similar events in the past. Once network difficulty adjusts, mining activity redistributes geographically. The network, hence, stabilizes and continues operating normally.\r \r What to Expect Going Forward?\r \r In the near term, additional #volatility  is likely as the network adjusts and miners either relocate or resume operations elsewhere. However, from a long-term perspective, this event has minimal impact on Bitcoin’s trajectory.\r \r This is a short-term supply shock.. Once the adjustment phase passes, the market typically rebalances and $BTC  moves forward.","gravity_id":"371997825","id":30558,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T12:30:12.748Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T12:30:12.748Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T12:24:02.031Z","text_content":"$BTC  ,\r Dormant Silk Road-linked wallets moved $ 3.14 million in #Bitcoin  to an unknown address after more than a decade of inactivity, blockchain researchers say.

Increased participation and shrinking supply can create momentum, making this a simple but strategic opportunity to gain exposure to two deflationary assets at once.","gravity_id":"371997976","id":30621,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T13:00:11.828Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T13:00:11.828Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-16T13:02:04.762Z","text_content":"Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs continue to record large outflows — investors withdraw $582.4 million in a single day.
