This shift highlights the growing adoption of crypto as a functional tool rather than just a speculative asset.  Key Takeaways:  Stablecoins dominate crypto spending, with USDC, USDT, and EURI leading the way, while $BTC  is less commonly used for purchases.  WhiteBIT Nova, a crypto debit card, processed over €50 million in transactions, with users spending between €500 to €1000 per month.  81% of users prefer virtual cards over physical ones, reflecting the increasing trend of mobile-first financial behavior.  Europe’s embrace of digital financial tools is growing, especially in countries like Spain, Italy, Ireland, Poland, and Netherlands, where crypto payments are becoming routine. Stablecoins are preferred for daily spending, while cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are primarily used for long-term holdings.  This quiet yet significant trend indicates that crypto cards are no longer a futuristic novelty - they’re becoming a normal part of the financial landscape in Europe.","gravity_id":"372056095","id":34006,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T00:20:09.592Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T00:20:09.592Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T00:16:26.226Z","text_content":"$BTC  is at an interesting spot now.  -> Price holding rising support channel  -> Multiple rejections from the descending trendline so basically liquidity building  -> RSI showing bullish divergence  Sweep below support looks like coming soon then a major pump as we expected.

Longer-dated skew is also anchored around -5%, signalling that traders are pricing continued downside risk through Q1 and Q2, as ongoing sell pressure from previously inactive wallets weighs on spot prices.\n\nLooking into the December 26 expiry, positioning is increasingly polarised. On the upside, there is a notable build-up of calls at the $100K and $120K strikes, suggesting some traders are still holding out for a sharp relief rally. On the downside, bears have accumulated substantial put exposure at the $85K strike, pointing to expectations of BTC sliding below $85K in the near term.\n\nRead the full article here: https://t.co/YXlo3cu0he\nStart trading today https://www.derive.xyz/","gravity_id":"372058327","id":34243,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T03:30:06.714Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:30:06.714Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T03:24:00.118Z","text_content":"$BTC i thought i was investing in assets, turns out i was investing in anxiety","gravity_id":"372058319","id":34244,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T03:30:07.053Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:30:07.053Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T03:21:36.164Z","text_content":"$BTC \n\nBTC SUPPORT 83K \n\nIF GOES DOWN THEN STOP AT 75K \n\nWHAT ABOUT ALL MEME COIN WHERE IT GOES 😭","gravity_id":"372058299","id":34245,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T03:30:07.271Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:30:07.271Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T03:21:27.725Z","text_content":"$BTC is very close to falling below all of the\nmost important moving averages.\nWhen this happens, it often represents a good opportunity to apply DCA and make recurring purchases in a smart, disciplined way.\n#BTC Price Analysis# #BNBChain# #Meme Alpha# #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372057419","id":34246,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T03:30:07.497Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T03:30:07.497Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T03:19:36.972Z","text_content":"Bhutan’s Quiet Bitcoin Power Move ! 📰\n\nBhutan is committing up to 10,000 Bitcoin to support a new mindfulness-based economic hub, a rare blend of digital hard assets and human well-being.

We are in a bear market. There’s honestly not much to do right now except wait.\n\n\n“So if we’re in a bear market, why aren’t you always shorting?”\n\nI am. I’ve been holding a BTC short for the past four months. I warned you countless times that this was the top and not to expect much more upside. Right now, I’m waiting for a much better opportunity, one that I’m best at, buying bottoms.\n\n2. I believe we’re closer to the end of the downside than the beginning.\n\nMost people only understand what’s happening after it has already played out. The same thing happens in bull markets, and it’s happening again now. This bear market didn’t just start. It’s been here for months, as I’ve been saying. The real bear phase began around 99k, which I’ve mentioned many times.\n\nAs I said in my last BTC big update, I’m watching 72k as a strong support. That’s where I plan to add spot positions. We need to see a bounce there. If we don’t, then we likely enter an accumulation zone between 50k and 72k, and I think we’ll stay in that range for a long time before the next bull run begins.\n\nI’m basically waiting for two things, which I’ve always shared here:\n\nBTC reclaiming 99k to add more short positions\n\nA potential bottom around 72k\n\nAs for altcoins, they’re in a very bad state right now. Things can change, but until they do, don’t try to be a hero and buy blindly. Some alts look cheap, but there’s still a good chance we see another 30% drop before they form a proper bottom.\n\nThe bottom line is simple: protect your liquidity and wait for better opportunities. If you really feel the need to buy something now, reduce your position size in case you’re wrong.\n\nMerry Christmas in advance🎄","gravity_id":"372057776","id":34316,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T04:20:07.614Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T04:20:07.614Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T04:17:00.112Z","text_content":"$BTC my confidence graph looks like the chart after a fake breakout","gravity_id":"372058651","id":34317,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T04:20:07.839Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T04:20:07.839Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T04:16:29.776Z","text_content":"WARNING: 📉 Many crypto ETFs launching in 2026 will be liquidated by 2027.

That’s a meaningful shift. $BTC  hasn’t stopped moving, its investor base has evolved.  Over the past decade, Bitcoin’s volatility has steadily declined as institutions entered through spot ETFs and regulated products. A broader, more diversified holder base tends to trade with structure, not emotion, naturally reducing extreme swings.  In 2025, Bitcoin moved about 68% from low to high, while Nvidia saw a much wider 120% price swing. Bitwise views this as $BTC  entering a derisking phase, transitioning from a speculative asset to a macro allocation.  The firm remains bullish, still expecting a new all-time high as institutional adoption deepens and crypto markets mature. ﻿#Macro Insights#  #BingX","gravity_id":"372059982","id":34555,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T07:00:06.041Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T07:00:06.041Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T06:57:02.356Z","text_content":"$BTC wtf .technical analysis, fundamental, support bala bala totally drama, crypto manipulate system.

The crypto market has been moving in a way that really rewards patience lately, with $BTC  and $ETH  reminding everyone how important discipline and timing are. That’s why the BingX × Chelsea FC “Trained on Greatness” campaign caught my attention.

The idea of elite training habits translating into elite trading discipline feels surprisingly natural.

The key focus remains on price reaction within the 84–83k zone — this area will determine whether the market is ready to build a base for recovery or if the correction will extend toward lower liquidity levels. Additionally, the significant increase in short positions should be taken into account, as it creates market overcrowding and raises the probability of a subsequent short squeeze.","gravity_id":"372061736","id":34711,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T08:21:15.077Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T08:21:15.077Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T08:17:00.170Z","text_content":"$BTC i'm not depressed, i'm just historically bearish on myself","gravity_id":"372061733","id":34712,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T08:21:15.389Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T08:21:15.389Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T08:15:40.263Z","text_content":"🥹 How sweet! $BTC  drew us a little Christmas tree for Christmas 🎄 Currently trading around $86,750.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372062594","id":34713,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T08:21:15.640Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T08:21:15.640Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T08:13:00.397Z","text_content":"$BTC some people collect memories, i collect unrealized losses","gravity_id":"372061690","id":34714,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T08:21:15.905Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T08:21:15.905Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T08:43:40.398Z","text_content":"I'm bearish on $BTC  💨☕️🥳","gravity_id":"372061973","id":34718,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T08:50:05.823Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T09:00:08.240Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T08:39:25.176Z","text_content":"$BTC Christmas trend ...","gravity_id":"372061941","id":34719,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T08:50:06.135Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T08:50:06.135Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T08:39:00.119Z","text_content":"$BTC fiat calls inflation management. bitcoin calls it malpractice","gravity_id":"372061935","id":34720,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T08:50:06.459Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T08:50:06.459Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T08:38:00.062Z","text_content":"Today-tomorrow, as usual, the days when assets created to oppose the world's financial system will whimper like a little dog and react to data from the banking system's world! $BTC  #BTC","gravity_id":"372061928","id":34721,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T08:50:06.802Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T08:50:06.802Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T08:37:12.724Z","text_content":"$BTC\n\n💰 BTC/USDT — LONG (20x)\n📈 Entry: 87000\n\n🎯 TP1: 89610\n🎯 TP2: 92220\n🎯 TP3: 94830\n🎯 TP4: 97440\n\n⛔ SL: 83600 \n\nPERSONAL SIGNALS VISIT MY PROFILE","gravity_id":"372061924","id":34722,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T08:50:07.120Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T08:50:07.120Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T08:34:45.045Z","text_content":"Peter Schiff Expects 50% MSTR Stock Crash and Bitcoin Below $50K\nEconomist Peter Schiff said that MSTR stock correction is not over, predicting another 50% crash and Bitcoin price drop under $50,000.  \nhttps://www.coinspeaker.com/peter-schiff-expects-mstr-stock-crash-bitcoin-50k/?fsp_sid=5542 ","gravity_id":"372061901","id":34723,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T08:50:07.309Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T08:50:07.309Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T08:34:09.771Z","text_content":"$BTC Still btc is not below 70k.

As governments worldwide encounter more crypto-related cases, holdings like these show that $BTC  is no longer just a market asset—but a recognized component of national legal and financial systems.  ﻿Join us on Telegram: t.me/AlphaCryptoSignal  ﻿#CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#  #CMC Smart Quests#  #Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372071334","id":35189,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T13:50:05.985Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T13:50:05.985Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T13:47:41.349Z","text_content":"$BTC Again Fake Pump!","gravity_id":"372070346","id":35190,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T13:50:06.308Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T13:50:06.308Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T13:43:45.063Z","text_content":"When @ehcchur put a giant #Bitcoin logo under the ice, fans thought it was just a gimmick. 🏒\n\nNow they’re asking how to buy $BTC themselves.\n\n🎙️@kohler_florian shares how the Swiss hockey club became powered by Bitcoin, in a conversation with @graminitha1 at @token2049. 🔽 ","gravity_id":"372072295","id":35191,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T13:50:06.886Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T13:50:06.886Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T13:43:45.061Z","text_content":"Stacks integrates with Circle xReserve to launch USDCx, bringing USDC-backed, crosschain stablecoin liquidity to Bitcoin L2 DeFi and enabling lending, trading, and BTC-collateralized apps.

That’s why crypto lit up faster than many expected.  ￼  When macro gets friendlier, money tends to rotate beyond the biggest name in the space. Historically, that means Ethereum and major Layer-1s like SOL, BNB, ADA and XRP start to outperform once $BTC  stabilises, not just because they’re narrative plays, but because strong fundamentals and real-use activity attract fresh allocators.  ￼  The catch? Market metrics still show #Bitcoin  dominance high and the Altcoin Season Index depressed, which tells us big rotation is possible but hasn’t fully kicked in yet. Smaller, high-beta tokens can outperform in short bursts, but broad alt season usually needs sustained liquidity, expanding TVL, and real macro follow-through.  ￼  So in a lower CPI job: big caps first (ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP) while riskier mid-caps and niche alts often play catch-up unless Bitcoin’s uptrend truly ignites a deeper altcoin cycle.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372070529","id":35256,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T14:20:07.122Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T14:20:07.122Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T14:16:45.158Z","text_content":"Rate this bag!👇\n\n$BTC \n$GRX \n$CAST \n$PURPE \n\n #Cryptocommunity #GroveX #CRXChain ","gravity_id":"372070525","id":35257,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T14:20:07.484Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T14:20:07.484Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T14:16:45.097Z","text_content":"Lower low done.

That question keeps coming up, and honestly, the signals right now are more nuanced than most headlines make them sound.\n\nOn one side, prediction markets aren’t fully convinced. The odds are mixed, which tells me the market isn’t pricing in a guaranteed breakout. There’s hesitation, uncertainty, and a lot of “wait and see” behavior. But that’s not necessarily bearish. Historically, Bitcoin doesn’t make its biggest moves when everyone agrees, it moves when expectations are divided and positioning is light.\n\nMacro factors are quietly doing a lot of work in the background. Inflation data, Federal Reserve policy, and overall liquidity conditions are shaping risk appetite. The Fed isn’t aggressively tightening, and while rates and inflation remain key variables, the pressure isn’t as extreme as past cycles. This creates a fragile but supportive environment where risk assets can breathe if conditions tilt even slightly positive.\n\nThen there’s the ETF factor. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have changed the structure of demand. These flows aren’t driven by hype or social media narratives; they reflect longer-term allocation decisions. When ETF inflows stay consistent, they act like a slow, steady bid under price, and that’s often how major levels eventually give way.\n\nSo will Bitcoin hit $100K before 2026? It’s not guaranteed, and prediction markets reflect that uncertainty. But between steady ETF demand, macro conditions that aren’t outright hostile, and a market that feels more tired than euphoric, the setup is quietly interesting.\n\nBig Bitcoin moves don’t usually arrive with excitement.\nThey arrive when conviction is low, and patience runs out.\n\nThat’s what makes this phase worth watching closely.\n\nTrack BTC here: \nhttps://t.co/JkRFmlPJcH\n\nDETAILED ARTICLE-\nhttps://t.co/O9CNZ2T2a2","gravity_id":"372070803","id":35349,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T15:00:06.600Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T15:00:06.600Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-18T14:55:14.044Z","text_content":"$BTC 🤩 Market Update from BitStake Trading | BTC\n\n\nAs of December 17, the market moved precisely through the previously marked zones — reactions were clean and technically accurate, with liquidity taken exactly as expected.
