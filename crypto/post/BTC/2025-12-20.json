Immediate resistance is visible around 88,900–89,400, and a clean breakout above this zone could open the door for further upside toward the next liquidity pocket near 90,000+.

From September 2024 up to today, with $100,000 of borrowed money secured by my apartment and 1,000 $ in my pocket, generously lent by friends, I made $167 million by aggressively shorting BTC, SOLANA, and ETH.  I helped many people become dollar millionaires. But the time has come to pull money off crypto exchanges and hide it in other assets, far away from the banks of Europe and the United States.  I’d like to wish you success in the New Year, but looking at things realistically, it won’t help you. Statistics say 99% of investors lose everything within five years.  I want to live the rest of my life as a dollar millionaire — not return to my old life.  The crypto market crash in 2026 is inevitable. Major funds and companies — MicroStrategy, Oracle, BlackRock — will be the first to fall. Binance, Bybit, BingX will fade into the sunset.  I’d like to hope for the best, but unfortunately all indicators point not to a correction, but to the collapse of the entire crypto industry and the stock market.  This life has a code. Not kindness. Not mercy. Laws are written for the weak. If you want to survive — become the law for others.  Who are you? A predator or prey? The one who cuts, or the one who bleeds?

Democracy doesn't need politicians to believe. It needs cryptography to prove.\n\nToday's thread: Mathematical truth meets constitutional processes. 🧵\nPeru's CTO called Syscoin 'el testigo incorruptible' - the incorruptible witness. Not marketing language. Precise technical description. When you deploy blockchain for constitutional processes, you need witnesses that cannot be bought, threatened, or silenced.\nTraditional institutions rely on trust. Trust in officials. Trust in systems. Trust in processes. But trust erodes. Officials can be corrupted. Systems can be manipulated. Processes can be compromised. Mathematics never lies.\nPeru's National Office of Electoral Processes (ONPE) evaluated every blockchain platform. They assessed security models, operational history, technical architecture, sovereignty implications. They chose infrastructure with zero failures over 11 years.\nWhy Syscoin? Bitcoin-secured through merged mining. F2Pool, ViaBTC, AntPool - the world's largest mining pools simultaneously secure both Bitcoin and Syscoin. This isn't rented security. This is cryptographic guarantee backed by proof-of-work that cannot be attacked with capital alone.\nPeru runs their own nodes. Complete sovereignty. No foreign dependencies. No platform risk. But through Syscoin's settlement layer, they inherit Bitcoin security. Sovereign control + cryptographic guarantees. This is the hybrid model institutions need.\nThe technical implementation: Pedersen commitments + chameleon hashes create complete transparency with absolute privacy. Every vote verifiable. No vote traceable. Mathematics enables democracy without compromising individual privacy. This is cryptographic excellence applied to constitutional processes.\nApril 2026: Peruvian voters will experience democracy secured by incorruptible mathematical witnesses. Not theoretical blockchain. Not pilot programs. Actual constitutional democracy anchored to Bitcoin through Syscoin. Every vote cryptographically proven.\nWhen Peru succeeds, every democracy worldwide faces immediate pressure. Citizens will ask: 'If Peru can secure elections on blockchain, why can't we?' The cascade begins. First successful institutional deployment triggers regional adoption. Syscoin becomes democratic standard.\nBut elections are just beginning. Once governments trust blockchain for voting, the architecture scales to everything: national identity, property registries, supply chains, judicial records, healthcare. All anchored to Bitcoin through Syscoin. All witnessed incorruptibly.\nWhen trust fails, mathematics witnesses. When institutions waver, cryptography proves. When democracy needs certainty, Bitcoin-secured infrastructure delivers. Peru chose Syscoin. 14 weeks until millions of votes prove why.\n\nEl testigo incorruptible. The incorruptible witness.\n\n/end","gravity_id":"372114523","id":38141,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T19:40:06.599Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T19:40:06.599Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-19T19:36:24.484Z","text_content":"LIQUIDITY ALERT:🚨\n\n$1.5 billion in  $BTC shorts will be liquidated if Bitcoin rallies to $93,000.","gravity_id":"372114519","id":38142,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T19:40:06.943Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T19:40:06.943Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-19T19:34:33.013Z","text_content":"$BTC  jump NOW or I will send you a postcard from Moon!","gravity_id":"372111918","id":38143,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T19:40:07.280Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T19:40:07.280Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-19T19:32:46.080Z","text_content":"🔥 BULLISH: Citi forecasts $BTC  at $143,000 over the next 12 months, citing rising adoption and easing crypto regulation, according to Reuters. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372111907","id":38144,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T19:40:07.507Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T19:40:07.507Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-19T19:30:00.167Z","text_content":"⭐A whale just transferred 5,152 $BTC  , worth around $445 million, to Binance about eight hours ago.  - The coins trace back to holdings accumulated roughly five years ago, with links to other large ETH positions from earlier this year.  - While not confirmed, deposits like this to exchanges often precede selling, potentially adding pressure during last night's market dip.   - Follow me to catch the latest cash flow signals that will bring you big profits in no time  #TrendingTopic","gravity_id":"372111894","id":38145,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T19:40:08.096Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T19:40:08.096Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-19T19:48:49.961Z","text_content":"🔥 Bullish: Citi projects $BTC   could reach $143,000 within the next year, driven by growing adoption and a more favorable regulatory environment, per Reuters.    #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372114570","id":38151,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T19:50:06.396Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T19:50:06.396Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-19T19:48:35.404Z","text_content":"$BTC   shaky moves continue to mirror uncertainty in global stocks, while Ethereum shows resilience.

After the Brazilian real hit record lows in late 2024, Itaú highlighted Bitcoin’s potential role as a partial hedge against FX volatility, alongside its function as a global store of value.\n\nItaú’s guidance references BITI11, a Brazil-listed Bitcoin ETF launched in partnership with Galaxy Digital. The fund currently manages over $115 million, providing local investors with regulated BTC exposure and international diversification.\n\nThe move reflects a broader institutional shift. Similar allocation ranges have been suggested by global banks, signaling that Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not as an outlier, but as a structured portfolio component in emerging-market risk management.\n\nQuestion: Is a 1%–3% $BTC allocation becoming the new conservative baseline for institutional portfolios?\n#BTC Price Analysis##Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?# #BTC\n#Brazil","gravity_id":"372114827","id":38234,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T20:40:07.871Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T20:40:07.871Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-19T20:37:45.306Z","text_content":"Understanding security is key.\n\nSHA-384 offers a stronger foundation against emerging quantum threats than older algorithms. 🔒\n\nBTC.ℏ uses this intentionally as a forward-facing design choice.\n🔗 https://bitcoin.org.ht ","gravity_id":"372114825","id":38235,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T20:40:08.132Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T20:40:08.132Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-19T20:37:28.217Z","text_content":"Libya's Unlikely $BTC  Boom: Cheap Power Fuels Mining Amidst Government Crackdown  Libya has emerged as an unexpected hub for #Bitcoin  #mining , driven by the nation's exceptionally low electricity prices.

This marks the highest borrowing cost in Japan since the mid-1990s and officially signals the end of the \"ultra-easy\" monetary era that has dominated the global financial landscape for three decades.\nThe \"Yen Carry Trade\" Explained\nFor years, investors exploited the massive interest rate gap between Japan (0%) and the rest of the world. By borrowing yen cheaply and moving that capital into higher-yielding assets including  $BTC and high-beta tech stocks traders created a massive, invisible engine for market growth.\nToday's hike to 0.75% narrows that gap. While 0.75% still sounds low, the directional shift is what matters. It makes borrowing yen more expensive.\nHistorically, BOJ hikes have caused 20%–30% drawdowns in Bitcoin. However, the reaction today was notably muted, with  $BTC holding steady in the $87,000 - $88,000 range. There are three objective reasons for this resilience:\nAnticipation and Pricing: Markets move on surprises. This hike had an implied probability of over 90% leading into the meeting. Much of the \"unwinding\" likely occurred during the volatile weeks of late November and early December.\nThe Stimulus Counter-Balance: Simultaneously, the Japanese government is pushing through a $117 billion stimulus package. This creates a \"tug-of-war\" where the central bank is tightening (slamming the brakes) while the government is spending (hitting the gas), effectively neutralizing a total liquidity collapse.\nInstitutional Inflows: Despite the macro headwind, US-based Spot  $BTC ETFs recorded over $450 million in net inflows this week. Institutional demand is currently acting as a \"liquidity sponge,\" absorbing the selling pressure coming from the carry trade unwinds.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights# #CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#","gravity_id":"372116295","id":38256,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T20:50:08.505Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T20:50:08.505Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-19T20:58:54.773Z","text_content":"$BTC  NEXT WEEK BTC >$95","gravity_id":"372115799","id":38260,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T21:00:06.238Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T21:00:06.238Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-19T20:56:25.528Z","text_content":"$BTC which coin are you most bullish on this week ?\nBTC - ETH - SOL - Other ?\n#CryptoCommunity","gravity_id":"372116353","id":38261,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T21:00:06.582Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T21:00:06.582Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-19T20:55:03.258Z","text_content":"$BTC  get rich or die trying \" 50 cent, curtis jackson \"","gravity_id":"372116339","id":38262,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T21:00:06.948Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T21:00:06.948Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-19T20:54:48.249Z","text_content":"$BTC  BTC is  Bullish!","gravity_id":"372115778","id":38263,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T21:00:07.284Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T21:00:07.284Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-19T20:53:45.932Z","text_content":"$BTC  bam short short short.","gravity_id":"372117310","id":38264,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T21:00:07.624Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T21:00:07.624Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-19T20:53:37.602Z","text_content":"This cycle is perfectly mimicking the 2021 Bull Run.

Without a fresh bullish catalyst, consolidation remains likely, and failure to reclaim resistance may trigger a pullback toward the mid-$80Ks. \nOverall, Bitcoin’s trend is intact, but $90K remains the critical level to watch for renewed momentum.\nIn short, $BTC has weathered the BOJ rate hike without losing its structural strength, but $90K still stands as the critical barrier. A clear breakout would confirm fresh momentum, while repeated rejection keeps BTC locked in consolidation as the new week approaches.🚀🚀🚀\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372117789","id":38393,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T22:20:06.475Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T22:30:11.687Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-19T22:15:43.714Z","text_content":"MARKET OUTLOOK: Binance founder CZ says $BTC  could reach between $500,000 and 1,000,000 this cycle.

Trade size distributions were mixed, with percentiles largely in line with last week but slightly lower overall. Compared to periods of stronger market activity, trade size percentiles remain meaningfully smaller, reflecting a shift toward reduced ticket sizes across flows. On the product side, Titan’s new Composable RFQ functionality expands access to deeper liquidity by combining RFQ quotes with AMMs, improving pricing across a broader set of token pairs. Ongoing collaboration with liquidity partners is focused on improving execution quality and maintaining stable liquidity across key pairs.\nTrade size percentiles formed a clear tiered structure across pairs this week. USDC–USDT led by a wide margin, with a P95 of 495.8k, P75 at 6.7k, and P50 at 1.1k. BTC–USDC/USDT followed, posting 78.1k at P95, 15.4k at P75, and 2.8k at P50. ETH–USDC/USDT remained the smallest venue, recording 17.2k, 4.5k, and 1.7k for its P95, P75, and P50. The distribution continues to point to a market dominated by small ticket activity, with the largest trades concentrated in USDC–USDT and secondary size clustering in BTC.\nOn the aggregator metrics front, @JupiterExchange  once again leads weekly volume, followed by @KyberNetwork  and @1inch.

I'm following this closely – if we clear resistance, it could spark some solid momentum heading into the holidays.  On the flip side, I'm not fully convinced it'll stick. Holiday trading volumes are thin, so any breakout might fizzle fast on low liquidity. Plus, looking back, previous BOJ hikes led to 20-30% BTC pullbacks in '24 and early '25, as carry trades unwound.

Until a high-volume breakout or breakdown occurs, range-trading and mean-reversion strategies dominate.  On the execution side, I’m currently on my 9th cycle of the Crazy 48H program, using short-duration events to systematically accumulate BGB around the $3.50 region. This approach leverages event-driven volatility and incentive mechanics to compound exposure without increasing directional BTC risk.  I’m also tracking VELVET from a long-term thesis perspective, particularly for asymmetric upside tied to future adoption and ecosystem growth.

After a sharp sell-off, the market responded with a strong impulsive bounce, and since then $BTC has been consolidating in a tight range rather than giving back gains. This type of price behavior usually reflects strength, where sellers fail to push price lower and buyers quietly absorb supply. As long as BTC holds above the 87,200 – 86,800 support area, the structure favors continuation rather than another breakdown, making this zone attractive for dip-based long opportunities.\n\n\nFrom a trade perspective, the higher low formation and sideways compression suggest that momentum is being rebuilt for the next expansion leg. A clean hold above current consolidation increases the probability of a push toward 89,500 – 90,000, where prior liquidity and resistance sit. Bulls remain in control unless price loses the recovery base, in which case a deeper pullback could be triggered. Until then, the bias stays bullish, and patience is key while the market coils for its next move.\n\n\nBullish continuation favored above 87,000; weakness only if $BTC breaks and sustains below this support.","gravity_id":"372125894","id":38789,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T04:50:05.273Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T05:00:06.756Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-20T04:42:56.055Z","text_content":"$BTC ARE LOOKING SO BOULLISHHHH!!!!!!

Sticking to the plan, managing risk, and letting price action confirm the bias.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#  #Bitcoin  #BTC  #Bullish","gravity_id":"372127648","id":38904,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T06:20:04.817Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T06:20:04.817Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-20T06:16:45.063Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nThe daily average Transfer transaction volume of $USDT and $#USDC is approximately $192 billion, close to twice the sum of the top five cryptocurrencies.\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372127633","id":38905,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T06:20:05.033Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T06:20:05.033Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-20T06:16:45.058Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\n「Crypto Bros」 10-Minute High-Leverage Long Position on #Bitcoin, ZEC, and HYPE\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372127632","id":38906,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T06:20:05.250Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T06:20:05.250Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-20T06:16:45.057Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nChinese Shenyang Police Bust Cross-border Illegal Forex Case, Involving #Bitcoin, #Tether, and Other Cryptocurrencies in Wash Trading Transaction\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372128153","id":38907,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T06:20:05.480Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T06:20:05.480Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-20T06:16:45.045Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nx402 Concept Coin Sees Strong Rebound, PayAI Surges Over 107% in a Single Day\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372127630","id":38909,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T06:20:05.940Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T06:20:05.940Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-20T06:16:43.544Z","text_content":"BITCOIN DAILY TF UPDATE :    #BITCOIN  on Daily TF still moving back and forth, near the zone, broken the small Bear Flag #Pattern  too.

I took my free US and STABLE rewards from Launchpool, used them to farm even more through CandyBomb, then converted everything into USDT.

Traditionally, tighter monetary policy strengthens fiat currencies and pressures risk assets. The fact that BTC didn’t fold suggests underlying demand is absorbing macro shocks.\n\nThe BOJ move matters because it threatens the yen carry trade. If carry trades unwind aggressively, you usually see short-term risk-off flows, volatility spikes, and forced selling across markets. Bitcoin surviving that phase means sellers are getting exhausted, not empowered.\n\nNow, about the 90K question.\n\nFrom a structure perspective, 90K is not just a psychological level, it’s a liquidity magnet. Large players know that retail stops, breakout buys, and media hype cluster there. That makes it a prime area for either a clean breakout or a sharp rejection.\n\nWhat supports a breakout case: • Spot demand remains strong, especially via ETFs and long-only flows\n• Dips are getting bought quickly, indicating accumulation not distribution\n• BTC dominance staying elevated suggests capital is not fleeing crypto\n\nWhat caps the weekend upside: • Weekends are thin liquidity environments, easier to manipulate but harder to sustain real breakouts\n• If BOJ tightening triggers broader deleveraging, Bitcoin may range instead of expand\n• A clean 90K break needs volume confirmation, not just a wick\n\n Bitcoin can probe above 90K, but a decisive, sustained breakout over the weekend is less likely than a liquidity sweep or consolidation just below it. The real confirmation would come with strong volume early next week, not a low-liquidity push.\n\nIn short, BTC surviving BOJ hikes is bullish structurally.

Large open-interest clusters sit at $85K puts and $100K calls, a setup that often fuels volatility. ▪ Leverage unwind: BTC open interest has fallen from $94B to $59B, signaling reduced risk appetite and weaker speculative demand. ▪ ETF outflows: Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $161M in recent outflows, cutting cumulative inflows to ~$57B.  📌 Key takeaway: Despite the bounce after the Bank of Japan rate decision, BTC remains below key EMAs and trades within a bearish flag.

Following the 2021 market peak, price shifted into a distribution phase, developing a bearish structure that ultimately led into the 2022 bear market.  Today’s market structure shows notable similarities. After the strong impulse move, Bitcoin is once again consolidating during 2024–2025, forming a rising structure that closely mirrors past pre–bear market setups.  If this fractal continues to play out:  * Consolidation may persist through 2025  * A broader bearish phase could emerge in         2026  From a tactical perspective, my near-term downside target sits in the $60k–$65k zone, an area that aligns with prior support and key structural levels.  ﻿NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE","gravity_id":"372140652","id":40035,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T17:40:06.691Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T17:40:06.691Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-20T17:36:25.774Z","text_content":"Or Hash Ribbons indicator stop working or something strange going on with $BTC   ))  Since summer 2025 its just a flat line after signal Buy  #BTC","gravity_id":"372142205","id":40036,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T17:40:07.457Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T17:40:07.457Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-20T17:35:55.809Z","text_content":"$BTCwhen altcoin season?","gravity_id":"372141266","id":40037,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T17:40:07.814Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T17:40:07.814Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-20T17:35:33.503Z","text_content":"Oracle and OpenAI?
