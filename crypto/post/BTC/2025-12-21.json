This breakout signals strength, with the chart projecting continuation toward the $90,000–$91,000 USDT zone.  Momentum has shifted in favor of buyers, and as long as price holds above the breakout level, the bias remains bullish. A retest of support around $85,048 USDT would be healthy, but failure to hold that level would weaken the setup.  📌 Key Levels:  Current price: $88,643  Breakout zone: $88,600  Upside target: $90,000–$91,000  Support: $85,048  Range high: $90,395  This is a trend continuation setup — BTC has cleared resistance, and buyers are now in control.

Every major $BTC   cycle bottom has aligned with a test of Realized Price — and each time, it came with deep drawdowns: -60% (2018), -72% (COVID), -77% (2022). No drama. Just math.  Today, Realized Price sits around $56,000. From the recent ATH, that level implies a potential ~55% downside if history decides to rhyme once again. This doesn’t predict collapse — it defines the statistical pain threshold where long-term holders historically stop selling and start accumulating.  Why this matters: Realized Price acts as Bitcoin’s macro “fair value.” When price converges there, weak hands are usually flushed, leverage is reset, and long-term opportunity is born. Bears see risk. Smart capital sees asymmetry.  Watch structure, not noise. If $56K holds, it’s historically where cycles reset and fortunes are built — quietly, not euphorically.","gravity_id":"372164296","id":41178,"createdAt":"2025-12-21T11:30:12.514Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-21T11:30:12.514Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-21T11:27:40.914Z","text_content":"BTC Price Outlook: Weak Structure + Rising Sell Pressure Point to $70K–$72K Retest  Bitcoin’s failed push above $92K has shifted market tone firmly bearish. Price is now trading below key structural levels, including the Point of Control (POC), while RSI momentum has broken down, signaling fading buyer strength. As long as $BTC  remains under the $90K–$92K zone, market structure favors continuation to the downside, with $70K–$72K emerging as the next major support area.  On-chain data supports the bearish case. Binance recorded roughly $1.43B in $BTC  net inflows last week, a sign that traders may be positioning to sell. Rising exchange inflows generally imply increasing distribution risk.  Together, weakening technicals and heavy inflows strongly increase the likelihood of BTC retesting the $70K–$72K demand zone.

Volatility remains elevated at ~777 points, with a 0.88% volatility change, reflecting unstable price movement despite fading momentum. Combined with lower than average trading volume, the data points to a transitional phase driven more by liquidity reshuffling and gradual profit taking than by fresh buying demand.

While Jurrien is bullish on $BTC  in the long term, he believes that Bitcoin is once again following its historical 4-year cycle driven by its halvings.   So BTC’s ATH of $126K on October 6th was the cycle top in both “price and time.”   Based on the 4-year cycle, Fidelity is predicting that 2026 will be a down year with support for Bitcoin currently at the $65-75K price range.

After a sharp repricing earlier in the cycle, positioning reset and risk appetite recalibrated. What followed was not capitulation, but gradual supply redistribution, mainly from long-term holders monetizing past accumulation.\n\nDoes this mean the long-term thesis is weakening?\nNot quite. It suggests that, in the current regime, Bitcoin is no longer the asset with the highest marginal return for global capital. When alternative assets offer clearer short-term payoff or stronger narratives, capital rotates. That’s how cycles work.\n\nAre derivatives suppressing price?\nThey shape volatility at the margin, but the persistence and scale of this range are consistent with spot-driven flows, not leverage constraints. ETF data reinforces this: selling pressure remains largely internal to crypto, not imposed from outside.\n\nAre macro tailwinds finally turning supportive?\nYes, conditions are gradually shifting. Looser policy and more expansionary fiscal stances matter, but as context, not as immediate catalysts. Liquidity doesn’t flip switches; it amplifies what’s already underway.\n\nDoes Bitcoin react to a single driver at a time?\nRarely. Its behavior reflects market regimes, not isolated inputs.\n\nAnd what regime are we in now?\nOne of digestion and balance. Capital is being absorbed, not rushed.\n\nWhen that regime changes, the signal won’t be subtle.\nPrice will adjust first, the narrative will catch up later.","gravity_id":"372167512","id":41558,"createdAt":"2025-12-21T16:20:11.030Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-21T16:20:11.030Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-21T16:15:20.304Z","text_content":"$BTC  at a crossroads, huh? 🤣 Some folks think it's going to $70k, others $150k.
