The marked imbalance zone is acting as a kind of reference/resistance level.

We could squeeze upward first, suck in the crowd, then plummet and liquidate everyone.

This is a favorable time for DCA in crypto—accumulating at \"tasty\" prices: make a weekly purchase with an amount you can afford to lose—Bitcoin, Ethereum, and as for altcoins, stick to your favorites.

PAX Gold feels modern. Bitcoin feels volatile.\nThe difference appears when the system is stressed.\nGold ETFs track the price of gold, but payout in dollars. You own a fund, not the metal. You rely on brokers, exchanges, and the monetary system.\nPAX Gold exists on the blockchain, but the gold is in a vault. You hold a token, not the bars. Redemption is possible, but under legal, operational, and regulatory constraints. On-chain token, off-chain trust.\nBitcoin is different. No issuer. No custodian. No conditions. If you hold the private keys, you hold the asset. Finality is immediate.\nIts value isn’t in price, but in trustless ownership. In a world built on promises, Bitcoin is possession without a promise.

The subsequent pullback was accompanied by a decline in open interest. This suggests that the move was driven primarily by the closing of short positions initiated during the Asian and European sessions, rather than by aggressive new selling.  At present, open interest is rising again while price has moved down to the upper boundary of the gap zone (85.6–86.7), which was formed during President Trump’s speech last Thursday. This shift in open interest dynamics indicates that new positions are being opened, with a prevailing long bias.  Risk Scenario  If the gap fails to hold, price may continue lower into the higher-timeframe order block zone between 80 and 73, with the midpoint of this range located near 77.  Upside Scenario  A successful defense of the gap zone could lead to a rebound toward the following key levels:  Gap zone: 90–92  Resistance: 94  Upper gap: 95–101  #BTC  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372217969","id":45051,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T08:30:08.480Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T08:30:08.480Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T08:22:45.044Z","text_content":"🎉 XT Christmas & New Year Celebration Is Live — $2,000,000 in Rewards! 🎉\n\n💰 Complete daily trading check-ins to unlock draw entries and vouchers\n🎁 Win BTC, gold bars, electronics, and official XT merch\n🏆 Holiday card rankings share $500,000 worth of gold rewards\n🚀 One registration unlocks all tasks and rewards\nTrade, draw, invite — enjoy the ultimate holiday celebration with XT\n\n👉 Read more: https://t.co/QtQ07WG9UN\n\n#XT #Christmas2025 #NewYear2026 #CryptoRewards","gravity_id":"372218429","id":45052,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T08:30:08.862Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T08:30:08.862Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T08:22:13.522Z","text_content":"$BTC - Technical Analysis\n\n\nWeekly\nLast candle traded to 0.5 of weekly FVG again then closed below it as indecisive candle.\n\n\nLooking for consolidation or reversal in PA.\n\n\nNoting that P opened and traded to 0.5 of an old candle's wick again.\n\n\nDaily\nLast candle swept an old H then closed below it as indecisive candle.\n\n\nLooking for consolidation or reversal in PA.\n\n\nToday P opened and took out an recent L, so I have no bias for today.\n\n\nH1\nLooking for P to sweep buyside to look for short.\n\n\nIf P sweeps recent sellsides, I will likely to look for long based on how it reacts to it.\n\n\nOr base on intraday PA to look for setup.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nIf you find this helpful, give me a like.\n\n\nAbbreviations are explained & pinned in my profile.\n#Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372217954","id":45053,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T08:30:09.255Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T08:30:09.255Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T08:21:59.102Z","text_content":"$BTC  is heading for its weakest Q4 in 7 years, down about 22.5% so far.

Price is currently hovering around the mid-range near 87.5k, rejecting recent highs and signaling short-term weakness. The key focus is the marked demand zone around 82k–84k, where liquidity rests and buyers are expected to step in.    A sweep into this zone would reset momentum and potentially fuel the next impulsive expansion. The projected path shows a dip into demand, followed by a strong reclaim and continuation toward 90k+ resistance.    As long as $BTC  holds above the major demand, the higher-timeframe bullish structure remains intact. This looks like a classic liquidity grab setup before the next directional move.

BlackRock has officially named its spot Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), as one of its top three investment themes for 2025 - placing it alongside US Treasurys and mega-cap tech stocks.  That positioning alone says a lot.  Key signals from the data:  🔹 $25B+ in net inflows into IBIT in 2025 🔹 Bitcoin is ~30% below its October peak, yet demand held 🔹 IBIT ranks #6  among all ETFs by inflows, despite a negative YTD return 🔹 Total inflows since launch now exceed $62B, far ahead of competitors  In other words: price volatility didn’t scare institutions - it attracted them.  Bloomberg ETF analysts point out a simple dynamic: If IBIT can pull $25B in a weak year, upside demand in a stronger cycle could be materially larger.  BlackRock has also continued expanding its crypto ETF stack, filing for:  a Bitcoin premium income ETF (options-based yield)  a staked Ethereum ETF, as ETH products already pulled $9B+ in 2025 inflows  Takeaway  Bitcoin is no longer treated as a speculative side bet at the institutional level. BlackRock placing IBIT next to Treasurys and Big Tech reframes $BTC  as portfolio infrastructure, not a trade.

While they seem like opposites, their leadership reveals exactly where Bitcoin ($BTC ) stands in the current macro cycle.  🎭 The Tale of Two Narratives:  Gold (The Fear Hedge): Rallying on concerns over global debt and currency debasement. It has the \"Sovereign Bid\"—central banks are buying gold at record levels in 2025 as a primary reserve.   Copper (The AI/Growth Story): Rallying on the back of the AI revolution, data center expansion, and the energy transition. It reflects optimism in physical infrastructure.  📉 Why has Bitcoin lagged behind?  Lack of Sovereign Anchor: Unlike gold, BTC doesn’t yet have a consistent \"Central Bank bid.\" It remains a portable asset for individuals and funds rather than a cornerstone for national reserves.  Narrative Fatigue: BTC is caught in the middle—marketed as \"Digital Gold\" (passive store of value) while competing for liquidity with \"High-Beta Growth\" stories like AI.  The Copper-to-Gold Signal: The declining ratio suggests we are in a \"Late-Cycle\" or \"Fragile Expansion.\" Growth is happening, but system fragility is the dominant underlying theme.  💡 The Alpha Insight: Historically, Bitcoin doesn’t always move first. It often consolidates during this \"fragile growth\" phase, only to respond with extreme torque once monetary stress becomes undeniable.  The Takeaway: Bitcoin isn't failing the test; it's waiting for the macro environment to flip from \"Fragile Growth\" to \"Intense Monetary Stress.\" Smart money isn't looking at the lag—they are looking at the Coiling Energy. 🔋⚡  #BTC  #GoldVsBitcoin  #CopperRally  #MacroAnalysis  #Crypto2025","gravity_id":"372221251","id":45209,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T10:10:09.091Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T10:10:09.091Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T10:20:08.106Z","text_content":"NEW: 🇺🇸 Congress is now prepared to send the Bitcoin and crypto market structure bill to Trump's desk, says CFTC Chairman Selig  $BTC","gravity_id":"372225125","id":45222,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T10:20:11.383Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T10:30:09.555Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T10:19:45.041Z","text_content":"MSTR Stock Recovery Can Begin Anytime as Institutional Demand Jumps\nAnalysts say Strategy (MSTR) is trading at just a 10% premium to its Bitcoin net asset value, and any surge in BTC price could lead to MSTR stock upside. \nhttps://www.coinspeaker.com/mstr-stock-recovery-begin-anytime-demand-jumps/?fsp_sid=5634 ","gravity_id":"372220851","id":45223,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T10:20:11.767Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T10:20:11.767Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T10:19:33.323Z","text_content":"Quick poll: Bitcoin at $87K with 8 days left in 2025.

Gold’s strength is being driven by persistent inflation hedging and expectations that global central banks, including the Federal Reserve, may maintain a more accommodative stance in 2026. Investors are increasing exposure to assets perceived as stable during periods of monetary transition.  Bitcoin’s rebound above 90,000 tells a different but related story. Spot demand has improved, long term holders remain firm, and recent volatility has cleared excessive leverage. BTC is increasingly viewed as a risk asset with store of value traits, benefiting both from liquidity optimism and growing institutional acceptance.

Unlike earlier stages, the structure and mechanics are now fully defined, shifting focus from uncertainty to execution.\n\nThe public presale allocation is capped at 11.13 million BTCM, representing 53% of the total 21 million supply. Once this final window closes, no additional public rounds are planned. All presale tokens will be unlocked at launch, allowing immediate transferability and removing staged or discretionary releases.\n\nTrading is scheduled to begin on December 28, with liquidity provision allocated separately. This means early market pricing will be driven bv real holder behavior rather than delayed unlocks or vesting pressure, a factor that often shapes initial post-launch volatility.\n\nBeyond trading, Bitcoin Munari has outlined its validator and staking economics in advance. Validator rewards total 6.09 million BTCM, distributed over ten years with declining emissions.\nParticipation tiers range from full validators to mobile validators and delegators, introducing long-duration supply locking tied to network activity rather than speculation.\n\nAn important design choice is the separation between market access and protocol migration. Initial trading will take place on Solana infrastructure, while the project's own Layer-1 network will launch later via a 1:1 bridge. This sequencing allows liquidity formation to occur independently from technical rollout.\n\nWith pricing, supply allocation, and reward mechanics disclosed, remaining variables now center on execution: validator onboarding, network performance, and the eventual L1 migration. These factors will become observable through on-chain participation data after launch.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights# #Meme Alpha#","gravity_id":"372227287","id":45485,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T14:10:10.946Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T14:10:10.946Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T14:18:33.619Z","text_content":"$BTC  REPEAT AFTER ME! ----------BTC BULLISH!! from NOW on--------","gravity_id":"372223633","id":45515,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T14:20:07.592Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T14:20:07.592Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T14:17:54.176Z","text_content":"$BTC  The monthly chart with Bollinger Bands show clearlythe bullish market REVERSAL for BTC.!","gravity_id":"372223630","id":45516,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T14:20:07.843Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T14:20:07.843Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T14:14:13.470Z","text_content":"$BTC  SAYLOR IS NOW PARTNER WITH ERIC TRUMP!!!","gravity_id":"372223601","id":45517,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T14:20:08.225Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T14:20:08.225Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T14:11:29.511Z","text_content":"$BTC  I have been saying this for years!!!

So why is it lagging?  Two key reasons:  1️⃣ Structural difference Gold has sovereign demand. Central banks buy it as a reserve. Bitcoin doesn’t have that anchor yet, it’s still driven mainly by investors.  2️⃣ Narrative fatigue Bitcoin is now marketed more as a passive store of value than a growth asset. That limits new capital in a market chasing either safety or acceleration.  Meanwhile, the copper-to-gold ratio is falling, a classic late-cycle signal. Historically, Bitcoin often consolidates in this phase… before reacting sharply when monetary stress intensifies.  This may not be Bitcoin underperforming.
