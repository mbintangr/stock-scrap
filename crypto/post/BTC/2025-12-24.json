A large share of open interest sits near major round numbers, so price action tends to get “pinned” as market makers hedge into expiry. Is volatility already priced in? To a large extent, yes — near-term volatility is mostly priced. Implied volatility has been elevated leading into the expiry, which suggests traders already expect sharp moves. That usually limits surprise before expiry unless there’s a macro or ETF-flow shock. However, a few nuances matter: •Post-expiry risk: Once hedges roll off, BTC often sees a volatility expansion after expiry, especially if price breaks away from max-pain levels. •Spot vs derivatives: If spot demand stays strong (ETF inflows, on-chain accumulation), downside from expiry pressure tends to be temporary. •Gamma effects: Heavy gamma near current price can suppress movement short term, but increases the chance of a larger move once that gamma disappears. Bottom line: Near-term volatility looks largely priced in, but directional moves are more likely after the expiry, not before. Traders should watch whether BTC holds key support into expiry — if it does, a post-expiry relief move is plausible; if not, hedging flows could briefly accelerate downside before stabilizing. #Bitcoin  #BTC","gravity_id":"372234199","id":46099,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T19:40:07.313Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T19:40:07.313Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T19:34:45.038Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nTensions over El Salvador's #Bitcoin holdings ease as IMF praises economic progress\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372234190","id":46100,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T19:40:07.688Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T19:40:07.688Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T19:34:45.037Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\n#Bitcoin slips, crypto stocks suffer steep declines, as tax-loss selling drives action, analysts say\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372234189","id":46101,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T19:40:07.944Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T19:40:07.944Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T19:33:32.137Z","text_content":"BULLISH: BlackRock says $BTC  is one of its \"biggest investments\" this year.  #BTC  #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"372234185","id":46102,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T19:40:08.330Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T19:40:08.330Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T19:32:24.327Z","text_content":"$BTC  is facing near-term pressure ahead of a $28B options expiry, a size large enough to influence short-term price action and volatility.

In its Mid-December 2025 ChainCheck report, the firm describes this pattern as a “contrarian” signal linked to miner capitulation - when weaker miners exit the market under financial pressure.  According to VanEck, this signal has appeared again: Bitcoin’s hashrate dropped by ~4% in the month leading up to December 15, 2025, marking the largest monthly decline since April 2024.  Historically, such moments have tended to precede periods of recovery, as selling pressure from miners fades and supply tightens - a setup that often favors price growth in the following months.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372233638","id":46161,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T20:20:08.643Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T20:20:08.643Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T20:14:00.051Z","text_content":"🤨 Bloomberg Is “Burying” Bitcoin Again  Bloomberg reports that $BTC  is on the verge of its first annual decline without any major ban or obvious scam triggering it.

In its Mid-December 2025 ChainCheck report, the firm describes this pattern as a “contrarian” signal linked to miner capitulation - when weaker miners exit the market under financial pressure.   According to VanEck, this signal has appeared again: Bitcoin’s hashrate dropped by ~4% in the month leading up to December 15, 2025, marking the largest monthly decline since April 2024.   Historically, such moments have tended to precede periods of recovery, as selling pressure from miners fades and supply tightens - a setup that often favors price growth in the following months.   #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372237259","id":46373,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T22:30:06.937Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T22:40:09.803Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-23T22:26:38.825Z","text_content":"Bitcoin $BTC   Miners Face Pressure as Network Hashrate Declines  Bitcoin’s recent price dip and rising volatility have put miners under pressure, with network hashrate dropping about 4% over the past month, the steepest decline since April 2024.

Historically, such hashrate drops often signal miner resets rather than long-term network weakness, making this a phase worth monitoring for BTC watchers.

Unlike equities or fiat currencies, it cannot be diluted by bailouts, quantitative easing, or emergency money printing during a market collapse.\n\n\n\t2.\tIn a deep systemic crash, trust in traditional financial institutions erodes. Stocks depend on corporate earnings, debt markets, banks, and governments. Bitcoin does not rely on any of these intermediaries.\n\n\n\t3.\tBitcoin is a bearer asset. You own it directly, without counterparty risk. In extreme scenarios where brokers, clearing houses, or even banks face stress, Bitcoin remains self custodied and permissionless.\n\n\n\t4.\tCapital flight accelerates during severe crises. Historically, when capital looks for an exit from fragile systems, it moves toward assets that are globally liquid, censorship resistant, and portable. Bitcoin fits this role better than any digital or traditional asset.\n\n\n\t5.\tCorrelation rises only during liquidity shocks. In the early phase of a crash, everything sells off for cash. Once forced selling ends and liquidity stabilizes, Bitcoin decouples and begins trading on its own fundamentals.\n\n\n\t6.\tBitcoin trades twenty four seven across the globe. It is not constrained by market hours, circuit breakers, or geographic borders. This allows price discovery to normalize faster than equity markets.\n\n\n\t7.\tGovernments respond to severe crashes with aggressive monetary expansion and fiscal intervention. These responses debase fiat currencies over time, which directly strengthens the value proposition of a scarce, non sovereign asset like Bitcoin.\n\n\nIn short\nStocks represent claims on a leveraged system.\nBitcoin represents an exit from that system.","gravity_id":"372240492","id":46527,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T01:00:06.343Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T01:20:09.136Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-24T01:07:02.956Z","text_content":"Whale Alert: #Hyperliquid  Whale (0xec32)  Long  BTC with 40x leverage, entry price $87707.9, position value $23.55M.

This doesn’t guarantee a rebound, but it does highlight a recurring pattern: stress in the mining sector has often marked transition points, not endings.\nRising energy costs and efficiency pressure are forcing weaker operators out, while more resilient and strategic miners remain. At the same time, government support for mining in several regions and shifting global energy strategies continue to reinforce Bitcoin’s long-term infrastructure.\nShort-term pressure is real.\nBut structurally, the network remains intact — and history suggests these moments tend to favor patience over panic.\nCalm signals matter more than loud narratives.\nBitcoin keeps proving that strength is built during discomfort.","gravity_id":"372242839","id":46729,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T04:50:06.458Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T04:50:06.458Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-24T04:47:01.134Z","text_content":"$BTC  Stock Markets at an ALL TIME High and crypto has a Thumb up its ass,  We all hate the manipulation ,we just have different ways of venting it ............also taking this time to perfect my Shorting Skill","gravity_id":"372242826","id":46730,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T04:50:06.874Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T04:50:06.874Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-24T04:43:53.142Z","text_content":"$BTC\n\n\n\nLet's gooooo","gravity_id":"372243323","id":46731,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T04:50:07.254Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T04:50:07.254Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-24T04:43:45.076Z","text_content":"BREAKING:\n\n🇺🇸 The SEC Chair just said live on Fox that the Bitcoin & crypto market structure bill is close to passing.\n\nThis isn’t rumor season anymore.\nThis is regulators finally putting lines on paper.\n\nNo timelines.\nNo hype words.\nJust structure being locked in.\n\nAnd here’s the thing \nmarkets almost never price this in before it becomes obvious.\n\nBy the time it’s “confirmed,”\nthe easy positioning is usually gone.\n\nNot saying moon.\nJust saying this matters more than most people think.","gravity_id":"372242812","id":46732,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T04:50:07.654Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T04:50:07.654Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-24T04:42:15.150Z","text_content":"🔥 UPDATE: Another solo #Bitcoin miner has successfully mined a block, earning 3.12 $BTC  worth about $281,000.","gravity_id":"372243308","id":46733,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T04:50:08.032Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T04:50:08.032Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-24T04:41:25.863Z","text_content":"$BTC  : There's still no clear confirmation that a wave-2 low is in.

Market Snapshot $BTC   faces mounting pressure ahead of a $28 billion options expiry.  Traders are closely watching whether the event will trigger heightened volatility or if markets have already priced in the risk.  BTC remains sensitive to derivatives driven flows, with open interest at historically elevated levels.  🔎 Why the Expiry Matters Options expiry often acts as a catalyst for sharp price moves, as contracts settle and liquidity shifts.  $28B in notional value represents one of the largest expiries in recent months, amplifying market uncertainty.  Key strike prices around $90K and $85K could determine whether bulls or bears gain short term control.  Is Volatility Priced In? Derivatives data suggests implied volatility has already risen, hinting that traders expect turbulence.  Spot market resilience shows BTC holding key support levels despite expiry pressure.  Macro backdrop: Broader risk sentiment, including equities and gold, may dampen or amplify crypto volatility.   Investor Takeaway The $28B expiry is a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. While some volatility may already be priced in, the sheer scale of contracts expiring means traders should brace for potential swings. Whether BTC breaks higher or faces renewed selling pressure will depend on how markets digest this massive derivatives event. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372244046","id":46783,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T05:30:08.210Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T05:30:08.210Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-24T05:21:31.271Z","text_content":"Buying pressure across the crypto market continues to fade, and $BTC   is clearly losing steam.

A resolution is likely within the next 72 hours.  Key level: $87K (the options flip point) - Above $87K: Market makers sell into rallies and buy the dips, quickly smothering upward momentum. - Below $87K: Selling pressure increases, and volatility spikes.  Why can't it break above $90K? A large concentration of Call options sits there. Dealers are short those Calls and hedge by selling BTC, so every approach to $90K gets quickly sold into.  Why is $85K being defended? That's where a significant cluster of Put options lies. As the price drops, whales buy BTC to hedge, and any sell-offs get instantly absorbed.  The catalyst: December 26th – Options Expiry On this date, a large portion of current options contracts expire. Roughly 75% of the open interest pinning the price will disappear.

Bloomberg notes that the pullback has caught many bulls off guard, with trading volumes staying low and investors stepping away from Bitcoin ETFs rather than buying the dip.  The contrast is even sharper when looking at stocks.

It's Christmas week, markets are thin, everyone's half-checked-out for holidays, and then boom, biggest options expiry ever. Dealers are doing their thing, pinning price, keeping volatility low so they don't get blown up. It feels calm on the surface… almost too calm. But that's the thing about these expiries: the quiet before is usually when people get complacent. Once Friday passes and all those hedges unwind, the market suddenly gets \"permission\" to move again. It can go either way big squeeze up or nasty drop, but it rarely stays flat. I've been in spots like this before where everyone says \"it's priced in\" and then we get a 10% move in 24 hours. So no, I don't think the real volatility is fully priced in yet. The chart looks sleepy, but underneath it's coiled. My human take: If you're holding long-term, this is just noise—close the app and enjoy the holidays. If you're trading, respect the gamma wall and don't get greedy on leverage this week. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372246668","id":47078,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T08:50:05.380Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T08:50:05.380Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-24T08:43:45.245Z","text_content":"The market’s been slow, and $BTC  recent dip hasn’t helped confidence.

Large expiries often bring heightened volatility, but current market behavior suggests some of that risk may already be reflected in price.  Options data shows open interest heavily clustered around key strike levels, encouraging price pinning as market makers hedge exposure. At the same time, implied volatility has eased compared to earlier in the month, signaling that traders are not aggressively pricing in extreme moves.  Spot market activity remains relatively stable, with no signs of panic selling from long term holders. Funding rates are also neutral, indicating that leverage is not excessively skewed in either direction. This setup reduces the likelihood of a sharp liquidation-driven move unless an external catalyst appears.  If Bitcoin stays within its current range through expiry, post-expiration price discovery could follow as hedging pressure lifts. Until then, volatility may remain contained, with the market waiting for a clearer signal once the 28 billion dollar overhang clears.","gravity_id":"372249015","id":47163,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T09:50:06.308Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T09:50:06.308Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-24T09:58:47.742Z","text_content":"BREAKING: 🇺🇸 SEC Chair Paul Atkins says crypto market structure legislation is about to pass in Congress. $BTC","gravity_id":"372248679","id":47172,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T10:00:04.416Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T10:00:04.416Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-24T09:56:50.820Z","text_content":"🎶 $BTC  Meets the Orchestra: A New Symphony of Crypto  In Brazil, a live orchestra will transform Bitcoin price movements into music!

This created a mechanical \"buy zone\" at $85k and a \"sell zone\" at $90k. It’s not a lack of demand; it’s a structural lock known as Gamma Pinning. Dealers buy the dips and sell the rallies to stay delta-neutral, effectively \"pinning\" the price in place.  ⛓️ The Friday \"Release\" (Dec 26): This balance is about to weaken significantly. We are approaching a massive year-end options expiry with $23.8 Billion in notional value.  Why the structure leans Bullish:  Put/Call Ratio: The open interest is heavily skewed toward Calls (bullish bets), with major strikes clustered well above the current range.  Max Pain Gravity: The \"Max Pain\" level—the price at which most options expire worthless—is currently sitting near $96,000. Historically, when spot price is pinned below Max Pain, the removal of hedging pressure often leads to a rapid \"gravitational\" pull toward that level.  Volatility Crush: Implied Volatility (IV) is near 1-month lows. The market is currently \"underpricing\" the potential move, making the spring even tighter.  ⚡ The Verdict: Positioning has dominated price for weeks.
