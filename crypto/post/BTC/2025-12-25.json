Both bulls and bears are likely to be punished once again by the market.","gravity_id":"372260707","id":47961,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T19:50:04.162Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T20:00:05.466Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-24T19:47:00.109Z","text_content":"📊 $BTC  News: Berkshire Shifts Tech Bets: Apple Down, Alphabet Up  Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is reshaping its tech exposure, cutting Apple and building a new stake in Alphabet:   • Apple: Sold 41.7M shares, reducing weighting to 21% (74% drop over 2 years) 🍏  • Alphabet: Bought 17.8M shares (~2% of portfolio), adding exposure to AI, cloud & search ads 🤖☁️  📈 Apple Insights  • $102B revenue Q3 (+8% YoY) and non-GAAP EPS $1.85 (+13%)  • Installed base: 2.35B devices  • Apple Intelligence AI suite live, with paid tiers expected soon  🚀 Alphabet Highlights  • Market cap: $3.7T, 3rd largest globally  • Focus: Digital ads, cloud, autonomous tech  • Buffett embracing AI-enabled companies for the first time  So, $BTC  fam, Buffett is pivoting from mature tech revenue (Apple) toward AI & cloud growth (Alphabet), signaling confidence in long-term tech innovation.  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372260699","id":47962,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T19:50:04.356Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T20:00:05.577Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-24T19:46:45.092Z","text_content":"Bitcoin is the art of discipline painted in code. 🧠🔥\n\nEvery transaction, every block, every halving tells a story of resilience, a movement powered by belief, not bureaucracy. \n\nWhile markets chase trends, Bitcoin stays timeless, a masterpiece of freedom and mathematics. \n\nThe longer you hold, the clearer the picture becomes.\n\n#Bitcoin #Web3 #Crypto","gravity_id":"372262023","id":47963,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T19:50:04.543Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T20:00:05.689Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-24T19:46:18.853Z","text_content":"I almost skipped Bitget Crazy 48H because I assumed it wasn’t worth the effort.

Analyst Woominkyu notes that when the BTC Combined Market Index (BCMI) returned to 0.5 in October, it looked like a healthy cooldown, not a cycle top.  📉 But since then, price and on-chain momentum have dropped together. That matters. Historically, real cycle bottoms only formed when BCMI reached much lower levels:  • 2019 bottom: ~0.25 • 2023 bottom: ~0.35  🤔 Today, BCMI sits below equilibrium - but still well above past bottom zones.

For now, Bitcoin is stuck between uncertainty and patience.  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372268008","id":48265,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T01:00:05.366Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T01:00:05.366Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-25T01:29:17.010Z","text_content":"$BTC Netflix\n\n\n$NFLX is trading below its 200-day moving average by 18%, the most in more than 3 years dm and follow up Lorena Zeus on TikTok for sweet updates to get started up with her on TikTok immediately she will take you on Stocks , Crypto, Bonds etc","gravity_id":"372265586","id":48270,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T01:30:04.770Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T02:00:06.170Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-25T01:27:43.883Z","text_content":"$BTC \r Analyst Ali Martinez says #Bitcoin  has historically bottomed ~364 days after major tops.

As the market enters a cooling phase, many projects are now trading significantly below the valuations they secured during their final private funding rounds.   Startups that were valued at nearly $1billion during the bull cycle are now seeing their public market caps shrink to a fraction of that. In some cases, tokens have dropped by over 70% shortly after their Token Generation Event (TGE).  Analysts suggest that as global liquidity tightened, the market \"corrected\" the inflated price tags formed during the peak of the hype.  High private valuations often leave little \"upside\" for retail investors.

Gold has an elastic supply: price increases make it economically profitable to develop new deposits. This increases issuance and erodes value. The supply of precious metals is growing by about 1-2% per year. #Bitcoin   “inverts the commodity economy.” Its supply is inelastic and fixed by protocol at 21 million coins. Price increases or increased interest cannot increase the amount of cryptocurrency — they only lead to an increase in the hash rate and network complexity.  Thus, demand accumulates in the form of thermodynamic work done (energy expenditure on security) rather than being diluted by emission.  Halving causes the energy cost of producing one bitcoin to grow exponentially. Gold does not have a similar mechanism.","gravity_id":"372279358","id":48926,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T15:10:05.020Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T15:10:05.020Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-25T15:18:58.350Z","text_content":"$BTC\nIncredible data: CoinGlass reports $150B in long and short liquidations this year, with daily leverage flushes averaging $400–500M across volatile crypto markets.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #BTC","gravity_id":"372280383","id":48937,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T15:20:04.989Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T15:20:04.989Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-25T15:17:41.173Z","text_content":"$BTC  Did you notice?","gravity_id":"372280380","id":48938,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T15:20:05.182Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T15:20:05.182Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-25T15:17:32.471Z","text_content":"$BTC   cooling off, so I’m adjusting the approach.

Collapses like Mt. Gox and FTX taught us that real reliability comes from things like cold storage, strong MFA, proof-of-reserves, and protective funds. Here are the top 5 exchanges focused on safeguarding, openness, and user protection, ranked by storage methods, audit standards, regulatory posture, and track record.  \r \r 1. Bitget – Stands out for comprehensive defenses and transparency. Most funds are in multi-sig cold wallets; monthly Merkle-tree proof-of-reserves shows >180% coverage for major coins like $BTC  & #ETH  . Has a $600M safeguard fund, ISO 27001/27701 certifications, continuous risk monitoring, and no reported hacks.  \r \r 2. Coinbase – Heavy U.S. regulatory oversight and strong custody practices: ~98% cold storage, insured hot wallets, hardware security, biometric controls, and ongoing SOC 2 checks.  \r \r 3. Kraken – Early safety focus with the bulk of assets offline, global key management, pioneered proof-of-reserves checks, ISO 27001 certified, and no major breaches.  \r \r 4. Binance – Uses cold storage and device-based logins plus phishing protections. Maintains a $1B emergency SAFU fund and has hardened defenses after past incidents.  \r \r 5. Gemini – Emphasizes regulation and insurance, overseen by NY DFS, with ISO 27001 and regular SOC reviews, strong for users wanting U.S. regulatory guarantees.  \r \r Quick checklist: confirm full proof-of-reserves coverage, prefer multi-sig cold storage, and verify SOC/ISO reports. Always enable 2FA, use address whitelists and hardware security keys. For long-term holdings, consider personal custody with a hardware wallet.  \r \r Good exchanges raise the bar, but your practices matter just as much, pair exchange protections with cautious personal security.  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372279556","id":48989,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T15:50:06.289Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T15:50:06.289Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-25T15:44:58.585Z","text_content":"$BTC Fake","gravity_id":"372276729","id":48990,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T15:50:06.511Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T15:50:06.511Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-25T16:00:00.219Z","text_content":"$BTC bitcoin doesn't reward emotion. it rewards execution","gravity_id":"372280583","id":48999,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T16:00:07.563Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T16:00:07.563Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-25T15:57:52.554Z","text_content":"$BTC\nBITCOIN \nLong start 👉 STOP $87,000\n#btc $bitcoin #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"372279619","id":49000,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T16:00:07.876Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T16:00:07.876Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-25T15:56:28.442Z","text_content":"$BTC   what is this ??? it wan'n fuk alll !!!!","gravity_id":"372280571","id":49001,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T16:00:08.103Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T16:00:08.103Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-25T15:54:23.363Z","text_content":"$BTC sgow me what you got !!!

That reaction keeps the rising trendline intact and shows that demand is still present at the bottom of the structure. Now BTC is pressing back toward the trendline area around 88–89k. A clean break and acceptance above this zone would confirm an upside resolution of the triangle and open the path toward the low 90s. Failing here and losing the 86–87k block would flip the story back into another failed breakout and shift focus to the lower supports again. The chart is clear: demand has spoken once, but the trendline still decides the next leg.  BTC bounced from the 86–87k demand at the base of the triangle after a first test above the downtrend line. Hold above that zone and break 88.5–89k, and the triangle resolves up; lose 86k and it turns into another failed breakout.

In the last phase, I closed out with 40 BGB earned, proving that consistency and discipline can still pay off even when the broader market is moving sideways.
