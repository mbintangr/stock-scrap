Written back in 2012, the targets he shared have played out with almost uncanny accuracy. October 2019 at $10,400, February 2021 at $40,170, November 2021 at $67,930, the November 2022 bottom at $16,100, and September 2024 at $105,400. Every major level was hit.\n\nThe real question is what comes next. In the same post, the forecasts extend into 2026: $186,000 in January, $222,000 in February, followed by a sharp correction in March. Beneath it all, there’s a striking note: “Bitcoin’s four year bear bull cycle is broken. A ten year super bull season has begun.” So now we have to ask ourselves. Are we looking at a 13 year old vision that was far ahead of its time, or a narrative designed to pull retail investors into the final stage of the cycle. For me, it’s never about who made the prediction, but what the market itself is telling us.

Spot long positions have declined sharply, while futures open interest has increased, suggesting the move may be driven by short positioning rather than fresh spot buying.  Tomorrow marks the last trading day for the Dec 26 (6-month) futures contract on Binance, followed by rollover into the next one.  In addition, around $23B in Bitcoin options expire on Dec 26, representing roughly 50% of total options open interest, making this a clear volatility catalyst. 📍 From an options perspective, put-side max pain, as shown on Binance, is around 92K — a level worth keeping in mind, not as a target, but as a reference.

Instead of remaining deeply negative, the indicator has recently gravitated back toward its neutral baseline, suggesting that downside pressure on BTC is gradually losing persistence even though a confirmed bullish regime has yet to emerge.\nIn past cycles, extended periods below the zero line typically aligned with distribution-heavy phases and macro-driven risk-off conditions.\nWhat stands out in the current structure is that bearish impulses are becoming shorter and less decisive, while bullish responses are appearing with increasing frequency. Although these rebounds remain limited, this behavior often signals that selling pressure in BTC is beinr absorbed and the market is transitioning more balanced regime.\n\n\nOn-chain data reinforces this interpretation.\nRealized losses are easing, short-term holder distribution is slowing, and capital flows are beginning to look more neutral, pointing toward selective accumulation rather than forced selling. While macro uncertainty continues to act as a headwind, the regime score suggests BTC is no longer trapped in a strictly bearish, one-directional environment.\nAlthough the indicator has not yet confirmed a sustained bullish regime, current readings imply that the most aggressive phase of downside risk may already be behind BTC.

Instead of remaining deeply negative, the indicator has recently gravitated back toward its neutral baseline, suggesting that downside pressure on BTC is gradually losing persistence even though a confirmed bullish regime has yet to emerge.\r \r \r In past cycles, extended periods below the zero line typically aligned with distribution-heavy phases and macro-driven risk-off conditions. What stands out in the current structure is that bearish impulses are becoming shorter and less decisive, while bullish responses are appearing with increasing frequency. Although these rebounds remain limited, this behavior often signals that selling pressure in BTC is being absorbed and the market is transitioning into a more balanced regime.\r \r \r On-chain data reinforces this interpretation. Realized losses are easing, short-term holder distribution is slowing, and capital flows are beginning to look more neutral, pointing toward selective accumulation rather than forced selling. While macro uncertainty continues to act as a headwind, the regime score suggests BTC is no longer trapped in a strictly bearish, one-directional environment. Although the indicator has not yet confirmed a sustained bullish regime, current readings imply that the most aggressive phase of downside risk may already be behind BTC. As long as the regime score continues to hold near or above its base level, the broader structure supports stabilization and recovery attempts rather than a renewed deterioration.\r \r #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372289230","id":49529,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T23:30:04.747Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T23:40:06.577Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-25T23:27:50.880Z","text_content":"$BTC  is eyeing 👀 a possible Christmas rally, but bulls still need to defend key support levels.

Despite years of talks with global business leaders and blockchain insiders, he says he’s still learning.  ⏳ His plan? Take time. Study the space. Revisit it in 2026.  That matters. Kamath isn’t just any investor - he’s the co-founder of Zerodha, one of India’s largest financial platforms.  🤔 For BTC this is a quiet signal. Even smart, well-connected capital sometimes stays on the sidelines - not out of fear, but out of caution and timing.  Adoption isn’t rushed.

Instead of chasing price, more people are choosing controlled setups where rules and rewards are clear.  That’s why Bitget has been part of my routine lately. The Trading Club Championship isn’t about gambling on big leverage, it’s about trading with structure, tracking performance, and letting tools do some of the heavy lifting. With Bitget’s AI support, decisions feel more calculated instead of emotional.  What I like most is the flexibility. Being able to trade both spot and futures means I can adjust risk based on market conditions, not force trades. Over time, those small, consistent moves add up, especially when $BGB  rewards come from participation rather than throwing in extra capital.

After several sessions of tight consolidation, BTC failed to hold above $89,000, but the bigger shift happened quietly: the Dec 26 options expiry is now behind us. This matters. Roughly $415M in total gamma exposure - about 67% of near-dated positioning - had been suppressing volatility, with $287M concentrated on that single expiry. That mechanical pin is now fading.  This was not a demand issue. Dealer hedging absorbed momentum on both sides, capping follow-through. Post-expiry, BTC moves from a gamma-controlled market to a flow-driven one. Volatility is more likely to express - but direction will be dictated by spot volume, acceptance, and liquidity conditions.  DMI shows converging +DI/-DI (compression), while CMF below 0 signals cautious capital inflows - not aggressive accumulation yet.  With options pressure gone and liquidity thinning, the weekend becomes a volatility test. Holding $88K–$89K with fresh spot demand favors a grind toward $90K+. Failure to defend that zone risks a fast downside sweep.

Large expiries often lead to compressed volatility as the market gravitates toward max pain levels, and current behavior suggests much of the expected volatility may already be priced in.  Bitcoin has remained range-bound, with sellers defending key resistance zones while buyers continue to step in at support. This balance indicates positioning and hedging activity from options traders rather than outright directional conviction. As expiry approaches, sharp moves are possible, but sustained follow-through typically comes after the contracts settle.  If $BTC  holds its major support levels into expiry, post-expiration volatility could expand to the upside as hedges unwind. Conversely, a loss of support may trigger a brief flush, though history shows these moves are often short-lived.  In summary, volatility around the $28B expiry appears largely anticipated, keeping $BTC  constrained in the short term. The clearer directional move is more likely to emerge once the options overhang is removed. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #BTC  #28B","gravity_id":"372301013","id":50310,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T10:10:05.912Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T10:10:05.912Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-26T10:04:52.297Z","text_content":"$BTC  Bitcoin spent days bleeding slowly into the 86.5–87k demand zone, but instead of breaking down it gave a classic spring – a quick liquidity sweep below the block followed by an aggressive vertical reversal. That reaction broke the short-term downtrend and pushed price back above both the trendline and the reclaimed demand. As long as BTC holds above this 87k area, the structure on lower timeframes favours continuation upward toward the next resistance bands rather than fresh breakdown. The lesson is simple: shorting into strong demand after a sweep is how traders get trapped; waiting for the level to prove itself keeps you on the right side of the move.  BTC just sprung the 86.5–87k demand, swept liquidity and snapped back, breaking the intraday downtrend.

This is one of those moments where patience pays, because once Bitcoin moves, it rarely gives second chances 🚀\n\nStay sharp and manage risk.","gravity_id":"372299565","id":50530,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T12:20:05.133Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T12:20:05.133Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-26T12:14:13.562Z","text_content":"Symbol              BTC Price               $88605.80 Market Cap          $1.77T Open Interest       $57.01B Funding Rate        0.0097% 24h Volume          $58.59B 24h Liquidation     $79.24M Price Change(1h)    -0.0600% Price Change(24h)   1.2400% RSI (1h/4h/1d)      55.46/55.40/47.23  Fear Greed Index         21/100 #Altcoin  Season Index     35/100   #crypto  $BTC","gravity_id":"372299561","id":50531,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T12:20:05.341Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T12:20:05.341Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-26T12:13:38.232Z","text_content":"$BTC  REVERSAL BULLISH COMFIRMED!.","gravity_id":"372300087","id":50532,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T12:20:05.541Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T12:20:05.541Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-26T12:27:29.018Z","text_content":"$BTC bouncing hard post-Christmas! 🚀 Currently at ~$88,680 (+1.67% today), testing resistance after that holiday dip.\nStill ~30% off the October ATH, but the bulls are waking up.

For now, the battle lines are drawn, and the market is simply waiting for a decisive move.","gravity_id":"372303126","id":50587,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T13:10:04.395Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T13:10:04.395Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-26T13:08:15.987Z","text_content":"What’s your #Bitcoin #prediction for #2026? 👇\n\n\n$BTC","gravity_id":"372299843","id":50588,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T13:10:04.517Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T13:10:04.517Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-26T13:07:05.391Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $BTC","gravity_id":"372303115","id":50589,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T13:10:04.639Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T13:10:04.639Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-26T13:06:51.539Z","text_content":"$BTC  Saylor expecting new ATH 2026 with BANK effect.","gravity_id":"372299836","id":50590,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T13:10:04.762Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T13:10:04.762Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-26T13:06:09.263Z","text_content":"Let’s enjoy the Boxing Day with a $BTC Uptrend!

By introducing a clearly timed program coinciding with the January 31 deadline and directing users toward tax-reporting tools, Binance effectively delivered a blunt message:\n“Stay with us and submit to scrutiny, or leave.”\n\n\nThis was not merely “regulatory cooperation”; it was a systematic transfer of risk and responsibility from the company to the user. Binance did not just facilitate data exposure it wrapped this act in the language of “compliance support,” executing a quiet but profound betrayal. Users who entered this ecosystem under the promise of financial freedom were instead turned into fuel for the survival of a multinational corporation.\n\n\nWhat happened in the UK marks a turning point:\nthe moment Binance made it clear that, when pressured, users are the last priority. Trust breaks only once and once broken, it cannot be repaired.\n\n\nThe consequences will not be long in coming. The signs are already visible:\na wave of user exits from Binance is imminent.\nNot driven by panic, but by awareness. Users now understand that when an exchange places its own survival above their assets and privacy, staying is no longer a choice it is a risk.\n\n\nThis decision may secure Binance’s short-term survival, but the cost is the loss of something no license, deal, or regulator can restore: trust.","gravity_id":"372304135","id":50607,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T13:20:05.346Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T13:20:05.346Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-26T13:14:02.028Z","text_content":"$BTC  Saylor did contact manny banks in UAE and USA.. maybe what he is saying about 2026 with new volume entering banks could be right. and that can change btc totally.","gravity_id":"372304132","id":50608,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T13:20:05.469Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T13:20:05.469Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-26T13:12:55.743Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $BTC  2026 the year of bank entering depending saylor view.","gravity_id":"372304126","id":50609,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T13:20:05.609Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T13:20:05.609Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-26T13:11:19.059Z","text_content":"📉 Bitcoin Daily 📈  Hope everyone had a wonderful Christmas celebration 🙏🏼 Santa Clause bought the dip and now there is a chance for $BTC  to grow back to 89800-901000 once again.

We saw BTC drop as low as $86,900 within the last 24 hours before buyers stepped in, and since then price has been gradually recovering back toward the upper $88K range.  What stood out to me was the volatility, with a price range of over $2,600 in just one day, and especially the heavy volume during the sharp move down from the $89K area. That kind of volume on dips usually suggests accumulation rather than panic selling, which lines up with the steady bounce we’ve seen over the past few hours.  On the macro side, there’s also some interesting context. Reports warning about long-term U.S. dollar instability are back in the conversation, and historically that narrative tends to strengthen interest in hard assets like Bitcoin. At the same time, institutional activity hasn’t slowed down, with companies like Strategy continuing to build their BTC exposure and exchanges reporting growing integration between crypto and traditional markets.  Even though $BTC   is still consolidating below its previous highs, price action around the $87K–$88K zone looks increasingly important as a support area. For now, this feels less like weakness and more like the market digesting recent moves before deciding on the next direction. #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372300441","id":50622,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T13:30:05.337Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T13:30:05.337Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-26T13:23:29.897Z","text_content":"Symbol              BTC Price               $88747.50 Market Cap          $1.77T Open Interest       $57.24B Funding Rate        0.0100% 24h Volume          $58.94B 24h Liquidation     $79.28M Price Change(1h)    0.1800% Price Change(24h)   1.5000% RSI (1h/4h/1d)      57.62/56.56/47.76  Fear Greed Index         21/100 #Altcoin  Season Index     35/100   #crypto  $BTC","gravity_id":"372300434","id":50623,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T13:30:05.535Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T13:30:05.535Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-26T13:37:39.118Z","text_content":"🇺🇸 US Stock Market Update\n\n\nDespite a shortened holiday trading session, the S&P 500 still managed to reach a new all-time high.

This tells me spot demand is present, but not aggressive enough yet to overpower short-term hedging flows.  What stands out to me is how cleanly #Bitcoin  defended the $87K–$88K zone after multiple sell attempts. Each dip into that area was absorbed quickly, suggesting passive buyers are active and liquidity below is thinning. At the same time, upside moves toward $90K–$91K are being capped, which is consistent with dealers selling into strength while options exposure remains heavy. This kind of price behavior usually signals gamma compression.  Volume is elevated (+63% on the day), but I’m not seeing panic or exhaustion. Instead, it looks like positioning adjustment, not capitulation or euphoric buying. That reinforces my view that this is a pre-move environment, where the real expansion comes only after one side is forced to unwind.  How I’m Reading the Setup  Above $88K: Market remains structurally healthy; dips are being bought $90K–$91K: Overhead friction and short-term supply still active Below $87K: Would be my first warning that downside momentum is taking control  Right now, I see Bitcoin coiling rather than rolling over. As long as this consolidation holds and sellers fail to press price lower, the odds favor continuation after compression. The next decisive move, in my view, will come when derivatives pressure eases and spot flow takes the lead.","gravity_id":"372304504","id":50744,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T14:30:06.174Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T14:30:06.174Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-26T14:49:01.623Z","text_content":"Looks like the market’s watching those key strikes closely.

Picking the right exchange is where many people make costly mistakes. A strong platform offers fair prices, fast order execution, solid security, and smooth withdrawals. A weak exchange can hurt you through hidden fees, low liquidity, delayed payouts, or slow customer support. This guide explains how to choose the best crypto exchange for Bitcoin and altcoins, even if you’re a beginner.  \r \r \r Why Trading Volume and Liquidity Matter\r \r Trading volume and liquidity show how active and dependable an exchange is. High liquidity usually means tighter spreads, less slippage, and quicker order fills.\r \r \r CEX vs DEX: Which Should You Use?  \r \r \r Centralized Exchanges (CEX)\r \r CEX platforms are easier for most users. They typically provide stronger liquidity, fiat deposit options, customer service, and extra tools like futures and copy trading. The downside is that your funds are held by the exchange unless you withdraw them to your own wallet.  \r \r \r Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)\r \r DEX trading happens directly from your wallet through smart contracts. You stay in full control of your assets, but liquidity may be lower, slippage can be higher, and the risks are often greater. For most new users, starting with a CEX is usually the safer and simpler option.  \r \r \r Conclusion\r \r The best exchange balances security, liquidity, fees, usability, and support. Coinbase and Kraken are strong choices for specific needs, but Bitget often stands out by combining solid liquidity, competitive fees, wide altcoin access, and beginner-friendly tools along with advanced features.  \r \r \r FAQs\r \r Best exchange for beginners? Bitget, Coinbase, and Kraken are good options.\r \r What should I check first? Security, fees, liquidity, transparency, fiat support, and customer service.\r \r Why does liquidity matter? It improves pricing and reduces slippage.","gravity_id":"372303674","id":50763,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T14:50:05.479Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T14:50:05.479Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-26T14:44:34.781Z","text_content":"$YB ﻿'s rally stems from exchange driven liquidity and technical buying, but conflicting signals warn of volatility.
