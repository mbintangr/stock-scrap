No VC backing. No influencers. Just one email, sent in October 2008, while banks were collapsing and trust in money was evaporating - by Satoshi Nakamoto.  “I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.”  That line declared independence. Independence from banks freezing accounts. From governments debasing currency. From intermediaries deciding who gets access to money and who doesn’t. It wasn’t about price. It was about power.  The brilliance wasn’t just the technology. It was the timing. $BTC  was born as a direct response to systemic failure, a monetary system designed to function precisely when institutions don’t. Proof-of-work wasn’t an efficiency choice; it was a security guarantee. The longest chain wasn’t just data, it was history you couldn’t rewrite.  Sixteen years later, trillions of dollars, nation-states, ETFs, miners, critics, and believers all orbit that same PDF attached to a modest email. No founder interviews. No exit. No control. And that’s exactly why it worked.  Every bull market comes and goes. Every narrative evolves. But this email? It activated a new era.  This wasn’t the start of #Bitcoin . This was the moment money stopped asking for permission.

In their view, the current BTC price reflects overly cautious expectations.  Throughout 2025, capital largely flowed into gold and silver, which saw sharp gains, while Bitcoin lagged behind. This created what BitMEX calls an abnormal valuation gap between BTC and traditional hard assets.  According to the exchange, this imbalance is unsustainable. As U.S. crypto policy becomes clearer and markets reassess the effects of Federal Reserve actions, Bitcoin could undergo a significant repricing - with BitMEX targeting up to $200,000 in Q1 2026.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372340151","id":53015,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T21:20:05.438Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T21:20:05.438Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-27T21:15:48.761Z","text_content":"$BTC If you don't buy this meme, you are an idiot ☠️","gravity_id":"372337601","id":53016,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T21:20:05.653Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T21:20:05.653Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-27T21:12:32.953Z","text_content":"$BTC  outlook for 2026 is not optimistic in the near future.

When silver jumps 10% in hours and breaks above $79, what does that say about risk appetite? According to Peter Schiff, it could spell trouble for $BTC  - and he thinks the move down could be faster than people expect.  Schiff argues that while silver’s rally reflects a shift toward commodities, Bitcoin could face the opposite pressure. Markets don’t fall slowly under stress - they accelerate. That’s his warning.  But here’s the twist. Despite the noise, long-term signals haven’t vanished. ETFs are still active, and Bitcoin has never closed a red year after a halving.  So the real question isn’t fear vs hype. It’s whether this cycle follows history - or finally breaks it.  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372341336","id":53167,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T23:40:05.266Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T23:50:06.227Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-27T23:31:21.885Z","text_content":"$BTC $77500 this night#","gravity_id":"372340880","id":53168,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T23:40:05.477Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T23:50:06.375Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-27T23:43:26.197Z","text_content":"🐂 #BTC leaves exchanges.\n\n\nIn 2025, #BTC exchange balances fell by 15%, which was one of the largest outflows of the asset in history.\n\n\nSince April, #investors have #withdrawn approximately 430,000 #BTC from #trading #platforms.\n\n\n💬\n\n\n$BTC","gravity_id":"372341390","id":53172,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T23:50:05.099Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T00:00:05.928Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-27T23:40:25.516Z","text_content":"$BTC Lorena Zeus made an analysis on this and said $ZETA is Not out of the woods yet...

Instead of aggressive buying or selling, traders are holding back, waiting for a clearer trigger before committing capital.

BitMNR, the largest known corporate holder of ETH, has officially begun staking Ethereum — a first for the firm, and a notable change in how large treasuries approach crypto.  What stands out:  • BitMNR staked ~74,880 ETH (~$219M), per on-chain data from Arkham • This marks the firm’s first-ever ETH staking activity • BitMNR still holds ~4.06M ETH (~$11.9B), around 3.4% of total ETH supply  At current staking yields (~3.1%), fully deploying that balance could generate over 126,000 ETH per year in yield.  Why it matters: Large holders are no longer relying solely on price appreciation. Ethereum is increasingly being treated as a productive, yield-bearing asset, not just a speculative one.  This could signal a broader shift in how institutional and corporate treasuries manage long-term crypto exposure.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #ETH  #BTC","gravity_id":"372351092","id":53452,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T07:30:11.868Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T07:40:06.501Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-28T07:34:45.222Z","text_content":"🚨 When will the Philippines have BTC reserves?  🚨\n\nIn August, Rep.

Despite periodic pullbacks, Bitcoin has maintained key structural support zones, signaling that dip demand remains active and broader trend structure is still intact.  On the derivatives side, options and futures data show compressed volatility and heavy positioning around major psychological levels, suggesting the market is coiled rather than trending decisively. This kind of setup typically precedes expansion, with direction largely determined by post-expiry flows and spot follow-through. As long as $BTC  holds above its mid-range support, downside moves tend to be corrective rather than trend-breaking.  From a fundamental perspective, sustained institutional participation through spot ETFs, declining exchange balances, and steady long-term holder accumulation continue to support Bitcoin’s broader bullish narrative. Macro sensitivity remains elevated, especially around interest rate expectations and liquidity conditions, but $BTC  has shown increasing resilience to negative macro headlines compared to previous cycles.  Overall, $BTC  remains range-bound in the short term but structurally constructive on higher timeframes. A clean reclaim of key resistance would likely trigger momentum-driven upside, while failure to hold support could invite a deeper but still technically healthy retracement. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#  #BTC","gravity_id":"372349183","id":53507,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T08:30:07.622Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T08:30:07.622Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-28T08:40:03.234Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $BTC","gravity_id":"372349467","id":53513,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T08:40:04.900Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T08:40:04.900Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-28T08:37:46.672Z","text_content":"I'm just waiting for \"He just wants more  $BTC for himself\" comments 😂","gravity_id":"372351754","id":53514,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T08:40:05.113Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T08:40:05.113Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-28T08:37:18.723Z","text_content":"We mapped every major 2025 crypto regulation change to show you which rules actually protect your wallet The era of \"invest at your own risk\" ended this year as a global patchwork of 19 new laws turned crypto from an abstract legal nightmare into a regulated utility.  ﻿$BTC  $ZEC  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372349367","id":53515,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T08:40:05.327Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T08:40:05.327Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-28T08:34:25.953Z","text_content":"[{\"sourceId\":\"6950eb278da14b09127d1189\",\"tldr\":\"Major U.S. banks plan to offer Bitcoin services, including custody, trading, and credit issuance, by 2026.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/post/372326131\",\"relevantWord\":\"Bitcoin services\",\"score\":\"8.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"6950eb1d8da14b09127d1169\",\"tldr\":\"Governments globally are integrating Bitcoin into official policies, signifying its strategic importance through reserves and energy strategies.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/69502382ac34221e2d010104\",\"relevantWord\":\"integrating Bitcoin\",\"score\":\"7.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"6950eb158da14b09127d115a\",\"tldr\":\"Post-$100K Bitcoin milestone, a market shift occurs from Satoshi-era whales to institutional buyers, dramatically reshaping dynamics.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/post/372338129\",\"relevantWord\":\"market shift\",\"score\":\"7.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"6950eb298da14b09127d1191\",\"tldr\":\"Post-Bitcoin halving, Bitmain reduces miner prices, fueling industry adaptation and potential market consolidation.\",\"url\":\"https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mining-crash-bitmain-slashes-hardware-costs-to-stay-afloat/#comments\",\"relevantWord\":\"reduces miner prices\",\"score\":\"7.0\"}]","gravity_id":"372351693","id":53516,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T08:40:05.545Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T08:40:05.545Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-28T08:32:50.298Z","text_content":"The  $BTC market is not in limbo between bear and bull, bearish sentiment prevails. \n\nUsually as market gets weak, Long-Term Holders stop profit taking.

With staking yields around 3.1%, fully staking this balance could generate over 126,000 ETH annually.\n\n\nThis move highlights a broader trend: large holders are increasingly viewing Ethereum as a yield-generating asset, not just a speculative one.\n\n\n#ETH #Ethereum #Staking #CryptoMarket","gravity_id":"372357063","id":53652,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T10:20:04.504Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T10:30:06.594Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-28T10:18:33.132Z","text_content":"$BTC  BTC making small steps on the way to cycle target, and to new green confirmations.","gravity_id":"372356069","id":53653,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T10:20:04.733Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T10:20:04.733Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-28T10:16:13.532Z","text_content":"$BTC  outlook 👇 🔹 Slower, steadier gains ahead 🔹 Less extreme drawdowns than past cycles 🔹 Institutions cushioning the downside 2026 still seen as an “up year” by Bitwise CIO. #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"372352654","id":53655,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T10:20:05.174Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T10:20:05.174Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-28T10:15:41.825Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $BTC","gravity_id":"372356057","id":53656,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T10:20:05.398Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T10:20:05.398Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-28T10:14:33.876Z","text_content":"$BTC  Flow in the market: The cycle start target becomes with the day lower  now 92547","gravity_id":"372356052","id":53657,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T10:20:05.557Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T10:20:05.557Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-28T10:29:25.212Z","text_content":"$BTC  $782M left spot BTC ETFs over Christmas — and that’s not a panic signal.

As we approach the weekly close, a move back to $88.6k, aligning with the weekly open and downtrend resistance, cannot be discounted. Currently, $87k appears to be the most robust level of local support.\n\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Bitcoin #Crypto#","gravity_id":"372356895","id":53877,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T14:12:32.140Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T14:12:32.140Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-28T14:01:45.036Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nViewpoint: Lighter TGE Will Become Key Indicator of Current Market Risk Appetite\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372355176","id":53878,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T14:12:32.273Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T14:12:32.273Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-28T14:00:00.152Z","text_content":"#Altcoins  Could Be Set for a Short Term Spike as #Bitcoin  Dominance Stalls $BTC     https://captainaltcoin.com/altcoins-could-be-set-for-a-short-term-spike-as-bitcoin-dominance-stalls/","gravity_id":"372357916","id":53879,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T14:12:32.540Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T14:12:32.540Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-28T14:19:57.124Z","text_content":"President Trump says he is ready to sign crypto market structure legislation as soon as it reaches his desk. $BTC","gravity_id":"372357992","id":53908,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T14:20:27.378Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T14:20:27.378Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-28T14:18:53.829Z","text_content":"Expert Outlines Key Crypto Market Trends for 2026\n\n\nPantera Capital junior partner Jay Yu has shared his outlook on how the crypto ₿ $BTC industry may evolve in 2026, highlighting several themes he believes will shape the next market cycle.\n\n\nAmong the main drivers, Yu points to continued growth in real-world assets (RWA), the rise of agent-based commerce, and the transformation of AI into a primary interface for crypto applications.

Bitcoin hasn’t had the year many expected. $BTC  is down nearly 10% despite ETF launches, growing institutional interest, and nonstop headlines. On the surface, it feels like a letdown - but that might be the wrong lens.  According to Michael Saylor, this quiet price action actually makes sense. He argues the last 12 months were the strongest period ever for Bitcoin’s fundamentals: ETFs went live, institutions stepped in, and infrastructure matured behind the scenes.  🤔 So why hasn’t price followed yet? Saylor points to leverage. Short-term moves are still driven by derivatives and trader sentiment, while about 85% of Bitcoin is held by long-term owners who aren’t selling.
