He argues the last 12 months were the strongest period ever for Bitcoin's fundamentals: ETFs went live, institutions stepped in, and infrastructure matured behind the scenes. So why hasn't price followed yet? Saylor points to leverage. Short-term moves are still driven by derivatives and trader sentiment, while about 85% of Bitcoin is held by long-term owners who aren't selling.

He dismissed the idea of a “crypto Christmas,” saying one of the best trades of 2025 was selling $BTC  and rotating into silver, which he believes better reflects rising risk aversion. According to Schiff, this shift signals a broader breakdown in the global monetary order. As central banks diversify away from the dollar, America’s long-standing “free ride” — funded by global demand for USD — could fade, triggering sustained dollar weakness and deeper macro instability. While $BTC  supporters see decentralization as the hedge, Schiff remains firm: in his view, hard commodities will lead the next phase of the reset, not digital assets.

It’s becoming obvious that everyone is on Christmas holidays: volatility is almost gone, and there’s a clear lack of news flow. Unfortunately, $BTC  is closing 2025 not on a positive note - and altcoins look even worse.  At the same time, shutdown risks in the US remain high. Government funding was only extended until the end of 2025, so January could bring another shutdown. The key question is how crypto will react this time. During the previous shutdown announcement, BTC hit a new ATH just days later.  So the options are limited: either we move against the crowd to the downside, or price keeps chopping in the $80k–$95k range, largely ignoring the event.

Options expiry often keeps price compressed because of hedging flows, and the clearer move usually comes after expiry.  Two main scenarios:  Upside: If BTC holds the mid-80K area and reclaims around 90K, price could move toward the low–mid 90Ks, where a lot of positioning and expiry interest sits. That would be a typical post-expiry relief move.  Downside: If BTC loses 85K, downside pressure can increase. 82K is a key put-focused level where price may react. A clean break below 82K could turn that level from support into acceleration.  How to read volatility: If implied volatility is high but spot stays range-bound, the event may already be priced in. If BTC breaks clearly out of the 85K–90K range with follow-through, then volatility was likely not priced in.  For now, direction depends on which side of the range breaks first.","gravity_id":"372369747","id":54612,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T00:40:05.316Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T00:50:06.527Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T00:46:45.042Z","text_content":"🚨 TODAY: Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says \"Bitcoin is good for USD,\" noting it acts as a check and balance against high inflation and deficit spending.

A federal court ruled in 2023 that the SEC’s prior denials were \"arbitrary and capricious.\" The court found the SEC's argument—that it could approve Bitcoin Futures ETFs but not Spot ETFs—was legally inconsistent since both markets are 99% correlated.\n * The Hacked SEC Announcement: On January 9, 2024 (one day before official approval), the SEC's X account was compromised. A fake post announced the ETFs were approved, causing a massive price spike and liquidations. This was a security breach, not a deceptive tactic by the ETF issuers.\n * Surveillance-Sharing Agreements: To satisfy the SEC’s concerns about fraud, issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity added \"surveillance-sharing\" agreements with Coinbase. The SEC had previously called earlier applications \"unclear and incomplete\" for failing to name specific partners.\nWe have been all fooled by so much hype just to be dropped like a bad habit. All because serious bitcoiners really care(d) about the world at large. \nI think I might just give up my stack and live on the streets.

Overall, the scenario seems somewhat pessimistic relative to recent action (every pump is followed by a dump). An unexpected rebalance could occur, sending us flying upward like rockets.

As long as BTC holds the $88.8K–$89K zone, this price action reads less like a top and more like the market quietly agreeing on a higher floor.  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372376980","id":55034,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T07:10:06.785Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T07:10:06.785Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T07:04:45.073Z","text_content":"Bitcoin just surged $2,600, wiping out $102M in short liquidations within the last 4 hours.\n\nThe total crypto market cap has reclaimed $3T, adding nearly $80B in a single day.\n\nAt the same time, gold and silver are pulling back while BTC pushes higher.\n\nThis could be the early sign of capital rotating from metals into crypto.","gravity_id":"372377045","id":55035,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T07:10:07.046Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T07:10:07.046Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T07:02:39.011Z","text_content":"Silver's the new hot thing? 😂 I guess it's better than whatever garbage they were pushing last week.

This positioning has narrowed price action as traders and market makers adjust exposure ahead of settlement.  Data from derivatives venues such as Deribit shows strong put interest near 82K, signaling downside protection from traders hedging against a deeper pullback. At the same time, call positioning around 95K reflects expectations of a renewed push higher if bullish momentum returns.  Price behavior leading into expiry suggests a classic pinning effect. Market makers often hedge in ways that keep price within high open interest ranges, reducing volatility until contracts expire. This explains the recent compression and lack of follow-through in either direction.  The post-expiry move will likely depend on spot market conviction. A sustained hold above current levels could open the door for a run toward 95K as hedging pressure unwinds. Failure to defend support may shift focus toward the 82K zone, where buyers are expected to step in.  For now, direction remains undecided. The expiry is acting as a short-term anchor, with clearer price discovery expected once options-related pressure clears from the market.","gravity_id":"372377374","id":55083,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T07:50:05.326Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T07:50:05.326Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T07:46:45.124Z","text_content":"GM, $BTC is approaching 90K again!","gravity_id":"372377364","id":55084,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T07:50:05.555Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T07:50:05.555Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T07:46:04.926Z","text_content":"⚡️ LATEST: $BTC   mining difficulty reached 148.2 trillion in its final 2025 adjustment and is projected to rise further to 149 trillion on January 8, 2026.","gravity_id":"372377359","id":55085,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T07:50:06.004Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T07:50:06.004Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T07:44:16.902Z","text_content":"📊 Market Overview by Margex  We’ll most likely not see $BTC  at $100,000 by the end of the year, but it’s still nice to see the market picking up slightly in the last few days Among altcoins, $ZEC  stood out the most  ↪️ Time to join Margex and trade! https://margex.com/en/markets","gravity_id":"372377347","id":55086,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T07:50:06.231Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T07:50:06.231Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T07:43:45.107Z","text_content":"Exactly 14 years ago today, the price of $BTC was $4\n\nAhead of his time!

To close a short position, you have to buy the asset. So, the rising price forced short sellers to buy, which pushed the price higher, which forced more short sellers to buy.\n​Result: The price went vertical because there was a \"vacuum\" of sell orders. About $137 million in Short positions were liquidated (vaporized) in the last 24 hours. \nThe \"Taper\" at the Top: Saturation\n​The curve is now starting to level off or \"taper\" slightly.\n​The Physics: This is Saturation. The \"fuel\" for the rocket (the short liquidations) has been exhausted. The system is reaching a new equilibrium where the initial explosive energy has dissipated, and \"profit-taking\" (resistance) is acting like friction to slow the upward momentum.\n​Key Stats from the Last Few Hours:\n​Liquidation Event: Over $398 million total was liquidated across the crypto market today.\n​The \"90k\" Barrier: Breaking $90,000 was the \"Critical Point.\" Once that threshold was crossed, the chart's geometry changed from linear to exponential.\n​Market Sentiment: Interestingly, despite this spike, the \"Fear & Greed Index\" has been in Extreme Fear for 16 days.

For that scenario to materialize, Bitcoin would need to lose several high-timeframe supports in rapid succession - most critically a weekly close below the 100-week moving average and sustained acceptance under recent demand zones. None of these conditions are present.  Momentum has cooled, but it has not flipped structurally bearish. More importantly, downside tests are failing to attract expanding sell volume. Historically, deep drawdowns require both momentum deterioration and aggressive supply expansion. We are seeing neither.  Relative to prior cycles, Bitcoin is consolidating far above long-term averages. Volatility is compressing above key structural levels, not below them. In previous bear phases, consolidation followed breakdowns. This cycle is different: price is ranging without a structural failure, and dips are absorbed faster.  Outlook Into 2026: Two Scenarios  Bullish continuation: Hold above the former triangle trendline + acceptance over $90,500 → upside extension toward $93,000–$93,650.  Extended consolidation: Loss of $89,500 → range expansion and delayed breakout into early 2026.  Probabilities have shifted. A deep crash now requires a clear catalyst or structural breakdown - neither is visible today.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372380045","id":55198,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T09:00:06.826Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T09:00:06.826Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T08:57:01.948Z","text_content":"$BTC  I'm bearish on $BTC","gravity_id":"372380044","id":55199,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T09:00:06.962Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T09:00:06.962Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T08:56:59.176Z","text_content":"$BTC January Effect yet again…","gravity_id":"372380043","id":55200,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T09:00:07.102Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T09:00:07.102Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T08:56:07.998Z","text_content":"$BTC  The market in flow, 0 % reason to sell now BTC, only about time before they enter it to cycle target","gravity_id":"372379106","id":55201,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T09:00:07.239Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T09:00:07.239Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T08:55:45.302Z","text_content":"BTC Price Jumps Near Year-End, 2026 Likely to Build on it🔥💹\n\nTo Know More👇\nhttps://thenewscrypto.com/btc-price-jumps-near-year-end-2026-likely-to-build-on-it/\n\n#Bitcoin #BTC #CryptoMarket","gravity_id":"372380029","id":55202,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T09:00:07.378Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T09:00:07.378Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T08:55:45.170Z","text_content":"Bitcoin Defies Bear Market Patterns with Surprising Moves https://ift.tt/4ARhXe3","gravity_id":"372380023","id":55203,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T09:00:07.655Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T09:00:07.655Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T09:20:30.583Z","text_content":"$BTC  Don't expect from BTC to go in 1 line, but when it go it will go huge after start cycle target","gravity_id":"372379370","id":55211,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T09:20:41.022Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T09:20:41.022Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T09:19:28.609Z","text_content":"JUST IN: Steak n Shake says, “if every customer paid with #Bitcoin for one year, our SBR would increase by nearly $500,000,000”\n\nBullish 🚀  $BTC","gravity_id":"372380288","id":55212,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T09:20:41.253Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T09:20:41.253Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T09:19:23.407Z","text_content":"$BTC  Bitcoin trending on healty TA now.","gravity_id":"372380287","id":55213,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T09:20:41.486Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T09:20:41.486Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T09:19:16.935Z","text_content":"Two major whales stepped in on Binance, purchasing 1,600  $BTC valued at 143 million dollars, signaling that big money is actively buying the dip. \n\n#Bitcoin  #Crypto","gravity_id":"372379360","id":55214,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T09:20:41.712Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T09:20:41.712Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T09:17:59.410Z","text_content":"Good Day y'all.\n\n $BTC almost broke $90k few hours ago and now back to $89.4k.\n\nCan we see break through this before the year ends?\n\nThat a big Question and I think MAYBE, depending on the market fundamentals.\n\nWHAT DO YOU THINK?\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372379350","id":55215,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T09:20:41.938Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T09:20:41.938Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T09:17:54.576Z","text_content":"Bitcoin $BTC  just surged past $90,000 for the first time in weeks, climbing as high as $90,800 amid razor-thin holiday liquidity that’s amplifying every move.

For many investors, this divergence looks alarming. From a cycle perspective, it’s not.  In previous liquidity cycles, capital has consistently rotated first into hard assets, then into Bitcoin. After the March 2020 crash, gold rallied for ~5 months while BTC ranged. Only after metals peaked did Bitcoin move from ~$9,000 to ~$60,000+. The current setup closely mirrors that sequence.  Silver’s outperformance is driven by fundamentals, not leverage. The market is in a structural deficit, with demand exceeding supply for several consecutive years. China, a key supplier, plans to restrict exports from January 2026 to state-approved producers. Meanwhile, inventories on COMEX, London, and Shanghai have declined sharply. Industrial demand (solar, EVs, electronics) continues to rise, tightening supply further.  Bitcoin is consolidating after a large liquidation event, similar to Q2 2020. This is typical in early liquidity phases, where lower-risk assets absorb capital first. On the chart, BTC bounced from a clear demand zone and is now testing the 200-EMA. A confirmed break could open $92,000–$94,000. Rejection likely means more range-bound price action.  The copper-to-gold ratio is recovering, historically an early signal of rotation into risk assets. With easing monetary conditions, improving regulatory clarity, and broader ETF access, metals strength may be a lead indicator - not a threat. If history rhymes, Bitcoin’s consolidation could precede, not cancel, the next expansion phase.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372379435","id":55230,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T09:30:05.184Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T09:30:05.184Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T09:28:39.899Z","text_content":"$BTC  breaks past $90,000 as precious metals cool off  While gold and silver pull back after fresh ATHs, #BTC  keeps pushing higher.

Is this how you want to propose to the banks this type of short squeeze is sustainable for an economy that is currently facing recession? Most likely we already are in one, and this type of maneuver will cause banks to panic and opt out.\nFrom a systemic perspective, this type of short squeeze is generally not sustainable as a foundation for an economy, especially one showing recessionary signals.\nShort traders just playing pure chicken. The \"Profit-Taking\" Phase: When short sellers are \"squeezed,\" they are forced to buy at any price to close their positions. Once those forced buyers are gone, the \"fuel\" for the spike vanishes. Professional traders and bots then \"take profit\" by selling into that spike, which causes the rapid \"complete reversal\" you observed.\nRecessionary Pressure: The U.S. economy has faced significant headwinds in 2025, including a 40% recession probability and \"fragile and uneven\" GDP growth. In this environment, high-volatility events like this are seen as \"liquidity mirages\" rather than genuine economic growth.\n​The Banking Perspective: I am correct that banks and institutional players generally dislike this \"mechanical\" volatility. Unlike traditional markets, crypto lacks a \"lender of last resort\" to stabilize these cascades. Massive liquidations—like the $19 billion wiped out in a single day recently—often lead to \"institutional de-risking,\" where banks opt out or pull back their capital to avoid being caught in the next \"unwind\".","gravity_id":"372379731","id":55291,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T10:00:05.722Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T10:00:05.722Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T09:57:44.588Z","text_content":"$BTC  The same example i did gave before also at 83K, when the most enter into panic selling, but time frame did told other story, like now the same as the most selling below 88K..

This level aligns with multiple confluences: • The 50% Fibonacci retracement of the 32,170–128,240 range • The zone below the April 2025 mid-low at 81,900 • The November 2024 gap zone on the 4-hour chart (83–80)  The 2025 opening level at 93,548 is very close and could be reached quickly, based on today’s push-up attempt.  Scenario: A move lower is likely first, creating conditions to open new long positions at more favorable levels. #BTC  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372381852","id":55580,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T13:30:05.687Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T13:30:05.687Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T13:29:21.544Z","text_content":"BOOOLEEESH 🐂\r \r Michael Saylor is buying #Bitcoin  again.   \r \r Strategy has acquired 1,229 BTC for approximately $108.8M at an average price of $88,568 per $BTC , pushing its BTC Yield to 23.2% YTD in 2025.   \r \r As of 28 December 2025, Strategy now holds 672,497 BTC, acquired for roughly $50.44B at an average price of $74,997 per BTC.  \r \r Relentless accumulation.

Only after metals peaked did Bitcoin explode higher.\nWhat's driving silver now isn't hype — it's a real supply shock.

This has reignited the debate around Dogecoin’s long-term upside.\nFrom a technical perspective, $1 is not impossible. DOGE already peaked near $0.74 in 2021, proving it can capture strong speculative demand during major bull cycles.\nThe key challenge remains supply. With over 168B DOGE in circulation, a move to $1 would require sustained, large-scale demand, typically driven by meme momentum and risk-on market phases.\nIf Bitcoin breaks higher and capital rotates into high-beta assets, DOGE could benefit disproportionately.
