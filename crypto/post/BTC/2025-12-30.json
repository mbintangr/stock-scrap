As the market heads into a quieter year-end, most majors are consolidating - and LINK is no exception.

That’s often what markets do before they decide.  What’s next 👀 A daily close above resistance, followed by acceptance above $14.50–$15, could open a move toward $16.50–$18.

A lot of the fear gets priced in before the headline hits.  Zooming out   Loose monetary policy usually pushes investors to look for value protection. In those periods, $BTC   often re-enters the conversation as a hedge against currency weakness.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372400561","id":56488,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T23:40:07.020Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T23:40:07.020Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T23:31:10.472Z","text_content":"$BTC  No reason to sell BTC, the cycle target becomes with the day more near.. break is on way.","gravity_id":"372400547","id":56489,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T23:40:07.266Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T23:40:07.266Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-29T23:45:21.493Z","text_content":"$BTC nowadays. you are buying Okay!

Kiyosaki has backed silver since the 1960s, and his core view hasn’t changed. He sees it as protection against weak fiat money and long-term inflation - but this time, he’s also warning that hype is replacing discipline.  Here’s where it gets interesting 👇  In past cycles, metals often moved first. In 2020, gold and silver rallied after the crash while $BTC  went sideways - then crypto exploded once capital rotated.  Today feels similar. Precious metals are leading again, and with easier monetary policy, ETFs, and institutions lining up, silver’s move may be less competition - and more a signal.  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372399979","id":56511,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T00:20:04.849Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T00:40:07.020Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-30T00:15:35.190Z","text_content":"$BTC  what is the prediction for 2026","gravity_id":"372399958","id":56512,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T00:20:05.091Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T00:40:07.280Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-30T00:27:22.291Z","text_content":"$BTC\nPray for a hard cut, and I will explain what this is. The \"Structural Reform\" Lever (The Hard Cut) This is the \"rebalancing.\" It involves moving from \"palliative care\" to \"surgery.\" Bipartisan Fiscal Commissions: There was active proposals in late 2025 (like the Fiscal Stability Act) to create a non-partisan commission that can force cuts to \"mandatory\" spending (Social Security and Medicare) without individual politicians taking the blame. The Hurdle: History shows these commissions only work when there is an immediate, visible crisis. Most experts believe the \"violent collapse\" is the catalyst that finally forces this to happen. Or... The \"Strategic Asset\" Pivot (The Bitcoin Hail Mary) The Trump administration's Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is an attempt to \"rebase\" the national balance sheet on a non-inflationary asset. The Theory: If the U.S. holds a massive amount of an asset that is increasing in value while the dollar is being devalued, the \"value\" of the debt effectively shrinks relative to the \"value\" of the reserve.

The question is no longer whether $BTC  scales, but who controls the institutional-grade rails for the next expansion cycle. Capital is concentrating around compliant platforms that can absorb TradFi-scale liquidity.  2026 = scaling at the infrastructure level. This is not about TPS alone, but about regulation, custody, reporting, and market access. As Volodymyr Nosov, Founder of W Group, notes, the U.S. remains the largest source of institutional crypto liquidity, making it a strategic priority for global exchanges.  The WhiteBIT USA launch signals a direct move into this arena, positioning the ecosystem to serve millions of users under U.S. regulatory standards while competing in the global tech race.  WhiteBIT Coin (WBT) has been included in 5 S&P Cryptocurrency Indices, including the S&P Cryptocurrency LargeCap Index and the S&P Broad Digital Asset Index. Index inclusion materially changes perception—WBT is now benchmarked alongside systemically relevant digital assets, increasing visibility for funds, mandates, and structured products.  WhiteBIT’s growth metrics are notable: 35M+ clients, global market presence, and an explicit IPO ambition. As liquidity increasingly migrates toward transparent, regulated venues, platforms aligned with institutional standards are likely to capture a disproportionate share of volume.  Index inclusion + U.S. expansion + IPO roadmap = WBT moving from exchange token to institutional instrument.

When Strategy slows its pace, it doesn’t mean the $BTC  thesis is broken — it means the cycle is evolving. Smart money adapts before conditions force it to.

Often, these claims come from lack of knowledge, poor strategy, or frustration with others profiting while they struggle. History, however, tells a very different story.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have gone through massive corrections. Bitcoin has fallen 50–70% multiple times, and Ethereum dropped nearly 90% in 2018, going from $830 to around $85. During these periods, critics claimed crypto was a scam, but over time, Bitcoin recovered and reached new all-time highs. \n\nIt’s also important to remember that around 20% of Bitcoin is lost forever in inaccessible wallets. Additionally, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins, making it a deflationary asset. Its scarcity, combined with adoption and utility, gives it long-term value.
