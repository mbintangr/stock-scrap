The run coincides with the drop in $BTC .  This makes me think that's where the bulk of silver's recent run came from, especially given that a lot of money is still in stocks and real estate.  Let's say this is correct, and let's take it to the extreme.  If all of crypto's money went to silver, that's almost $3 trillion, which would be good for silver, but after that money dries up, in order to keep silver going, the money will have to come from somewhere else.  The stock market and real estate bubbles are crazy swollen right now.  If money were to leave those bubbles, all it takes is a couple -3% or -4% days for panic to set in.  If there's panic, that can send most assets down, including precious metals.  Especially if people initially prefer treasuries and money markets as their favorite safe havens.  Having said all this, there will be a point after fleeing to safety when people will want to have action again.  The question then will be where to have action.  It's my view that I might still like crypto because if there is a lot of technological potential with some of these ventures, an asset class that is under $3 trillion, if it in fact has intrinsic value, that's the most UNDERsaturated asset of anything in the world.  So I conclude that I like safety now, but would later consider the best value cryptos I can find.","gravity_id":"372419671","id":57775,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T18:20:05.342Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T18:20:05.342Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-30T18:15:58.017Z","text_content":"$BTC Is the future 💫⭐","gravity_id":"372419663","id":57776,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T18:20:05.587Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T18:20:05.587Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-30T18:15:00.739Z","text_content":"$BTC  I'm bullish on $BTC  let's pump it all together on old year eve!!!!","gravity_id":"372419661","id":57777,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T18:20:05.836Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T18:20:05.836Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-30T18:13:34.908Z","text_content":"BITCOIN IS GOING TO $128,000 🚀\n\n $BTC\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights# #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372420583","id":57778,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T18:20:06.082Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T18:20:06.082Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-30T18:12:22.312Z","text_content":"#BITCOIN OG WHALES JUST STOPPED SELLING\n\nLAST TIME BITCOIN WENT UP 50% WHEN THIS HAPPENED.\n\nTIGHTEN YOUR SEATBELTS 🚀\n\n $BTC\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372420574","id":57779,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T18:20:06.236Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T18:20:06.236Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-30T18:11:18.007Z","text_content":"JUST IN: 🇯🇵 Metaplanet buys another 4,279 #Bitcoin worth $375 million.\n\nThey now hold 35,102 $BTC worth $3 billion.\n\n#Altcoin Season# #BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights# #BNBChain#  $BTC","gravity_id":"372420570","id":57780,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T18:20:06.439Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T18:20:06.439Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-30T18:10:45.052Z","text_content":"Could Bitcoin.ℏ be considered a type of digital gold?\n\nWith a fixed supply capped at 21 million tokens, Bitcoin.ℏ embodies the key characteristics of a store of value in the digital age, much like gold does in the physical world.

The bounce we’re seeing is more like a relief bounce after a drop, not a real trend reversal.\nOn the lower timeframes, BTC bounced from the 86.8K zone, which is a decent short-term support. Buyers stepped in there, so a small push upward was expected. But the problem is price is still struggling below major EMAs, especially the higher ones. That usually means sellers are still in control.\nIf you look carefully, every time price goes up, it starts losing momentum near 88.5K – 89K. Wicks are forming, volume is not strong, and the move feels slow and forced. This is exactly the kind of area where smart money likes to sell into optimism.\nZooming out a bit , the structure is still lower highs and lower lows. Until BTC clearly reclaims and holds above 89.5K–90K, this market remains a sell-on-rise type of setup, not a buy-and-hold zone.\nSo the plan is simple and clean 👇\nWe don’t short blindly here. We wait for price to come up into resistance and show weakness.\nBest Short Trade Setup\nIf BTC moves into the 88,300 – 88,900 zone and starts rejecting (slow candles, long wicks, or bearish close), that’s the short entry area.\nEntry (Short):\n 88.3K – 88.9K \nTargets:\n TP1: 87.4K \n TP2: 86.8K \n TP3: 86.2K \nStop Loss:\n 89.4K (clear invalidation)\nAs long as BTC stays below 89K, bears have the advantage. Bulls need a strong breakout and hold above 89.5K+ to flip the trend. Until that happens, upside looks limited and risky.\nLet price come to resistance  then short calmly.👀\n#BTC90kChristmas #StrategyBTCPurchase #USChinaDeal  #BTC #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372419716","id":57797,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T18:30:06.761Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T18:30:06.761Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-30T18:22:39.379Z","text_content":"JUST IN: 🇯🇵 #Metaplanet buys another 4,279 #Bitcoin worth $375 million.\n\nThey now hold 35,102 $BTC worth $3 billion.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights# #Macro Insights#  $BTC","gravity_id":"372419700","id":57798,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T18:30:07.044Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T18:30:07.044Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-30T18:20:57.233Z","text_content":"$BTCWHALE ALERT:\nWhale FRvvqp has deposited 3M $TRUMP worth $14.88 Million into Binance. \n\nThe position was bought two months ago at $7.56, resulting in an estimated $7.8 Million loss (-35%).\n\nThe classic strategy: buy high, sell the dip? 🤔","gravity_id":"372421457","id":57799,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T18:30:07.299Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T18:30:07.299Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-30T18:37:45.086Z","text_content":"Bitcoin mining stocks dip while infrastructure expands rapidly.\n\nMARA, CLSK, RIOT fell amid BTC's monthly decline, yet firms secured major deals.\n\nThis points to significant hashrate growth.

Most traders are taught to react to price. Very few are taught to read positioning. When price suddenly spikes, it’s tempting to assume strength. But impulsive pumps are often the weakest moves in the market. Here’s why. First, look at Open Interest (OI). If price moves up while OI expands rapidly, it usually means leverage is being added — not spot demand. New positions are opening into the move, chasing momentum. Then check CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta). If CVD continues to trend down or fails to confirm the pump, buyers are not aggressive. Market buys are being absorbed. Price is moving, but real demand isn’t following. Now add Funding Rate. During impulsive pumps, funding often flips strongly positive. That tells you who is paying — late longs. The more crowded one side becomes, the more fragile the move is. Finally, the most overlooked piece: Liquidity Heatmap. Impulsive pumps often run directly into sell-side liquidity or large resting orders. These levels are not targets for continuation — they’re areas where positions get distributed or trapped. So what usually happens? • The initial breakout attracts retail longs  • Liquidity sits above and below the range  • Market makers sell into strength  • Price reverses or stalls  • Late entrants get chopped or liquidated This doesn’t mean every pump must fail. It means pumps without structural support rarely sustain. That’s why I focus on structure, positioning, and liquidity, not predictions or emotions. The market doesn’t reward speed — it rewards understanding. This is why I focus on structure, not predictions.  #Macro Insights#  #Meme Alpha#  #BTCCharts#   For example, why $BTC  went down","gravity_id":"372433749","id":58525,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T06:20:05.332Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T06:30:06.531Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T06:11:21.585Z","text_content":"$BTC need some money","gravity_id":"372434748","id":58526,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T06:20:05.591Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T06:30:06.689Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T06:27:42.648Z","text_content":"Bitcoin Alert: Interaction with the Upper Bear Band\n\n\n$BTC is currently hovering near the Upper Bear Band—a technical region that has historically signaled late-cycle conditions.

This judgment has quickly sparked heated discussions in the crypto community and is seen by many investors as a significant institutional benefit in the medium to long term.\nFrom a background perspective, the current US cryptocurrency regulation has long been in a \"gray area\", with unclear responsibilities between the SEC and CFTC, enforcement ahead of rules, and delayed regulations, which has become the biggest uncertainty for institutional entrants. The core goal of this market structure bill is to clarify the regulatory boundaries of digital assets, asset classification, and compliance paths for trading platforms, establishing \"basic rules\" for the crypto market similar to traditional finance.\nGrayscale believes that once the bill is enacted, the first beneficiaries will be institutional funds. Pension funds, insurance funds, sovereign funds, and other long-term capital will have clearer compliance bases to enter the on-chain world. At the same time, compliant exchanges, custodians, and on-chain financial infrastructure will also welcome a new round of expansion, driving real trading volumes and on-chain activities to grow in sync.\nMore importantly, this legislative signal itself has the significance of \"expectation management\". It means that the US policy stance towards the cryptocurrency industry is gradually shifting from \"risk prevention\" to \"regulatable and developable\". For the entire industry, this is not only a possibility for regulatory easing but also an important step towards integrating crypto assets into the mainstream financial system. $BTC","gravity_id":"372438076","id":58700,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T08:50:06.130Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T08:50:06.130Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T08:47:51.976Z","text_content":"$BTC  LIQUIDITY TRAP ALERT 🚨\r \r Bitcoin is setting up a classic squeeze.\r \r Shorts have turned aggressive: open interest up, funding down → fresh short positions, not longs chasing price.\r \r Liquidity map:\r \r ⬆️ Upside: ~$91.5K\r \r ⬇️ Downside: ~$84.9K\r \r Bias tilts upside.\r Repeated rejections have stacked shorts at resistance, quietly building a liquidity pocket above.

As its price hovers near the upper boundary of its current downtrend, we are witnessing patterns that historically resemble cyclical phases. While this doesn't necessarily signal a \"breakdown\" today, the risk-reward ratio is shifting. Here are the details:\r \r 1. Trendline Battle 📉 Bitcoin is successfully holding above the long-term trendline support level, but the \"ceiling\" is trending downwards.\r \r Situation: The price is testing the upper resistance level of its descending channel.\r \r Warning: Momentum indicators (such as the RSI) are flattening. In trading, momentum flattening often precedes a distribution period, where large investors gradually exit while the price moves sideways.\r \r 2. Moving Average \"Attraction\" 🧲 Historical moving averages are acting like a magnet. We are currently observing key consolidation at the following levels:\r \r $62,000 (Short-term fair value)\r \r $43,000 (Deep cycle support)\r \r $27,000 (Total bottom)\r \r The gap between the current price and these levels suggests that while the trend is upward, downward pressure is increasing.\r \r 3. Accumulation vs. Distribution 🔄 Past cycles show that price action in this range rarely results in an immediate vertical breakout. Expect the following:\r \r Extended accumulation: A \"quiet\" market is testing traders' patience.\r \r Reduced risk: The \"easy wins\" are likely over as we move away from the base of the cycle.\r \r 🗳️ Community Poll\r How do you approach this range?\r \r 🔴 Take profits\r \r 🟡 Hold stocks during volatility\r \r 🟢 Buy on a breakout\r \r Share your thoughts in the comments! 👇\r \r $BTC  #Bitcoin  #CryptoAnalysis  #MarketUpdate  #BitcoinCycle","gravity_id":"372438557","id":58800,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T10:00:07.332Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T10:00:07.332Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T09:51:36.898Z","text_content":"🚨Bitcoin (BTC) Buy Alert\n\n🟢Buy: 88,600\n\n🟢TP: 88,800\n🟢TP: 90,000\n🟢Open\n\n❌SL: 88,300\n\nNote: MACD on 30 min chart showing bullish crossover a rise toward our target is imminent\n\n $BTC #BTC Price Analysis# #cryptocurrency #TradingSetup","gravity_id":"372437536","id":58801,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T10:00:07.610Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T10:00:07.610Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T10:08:27.780Z","text_content":"The key point is that $BTC  fluctuations mainly affect unrealized P&L, not immediate solvency.

Instead of retail-driven \"hype cycles,\" 2026 is expected to be driven by macro demand for alternative stores of value and regulatory clarity.  2. New All-Time Highs (H1 2026) 🚀 The report explicitly forecasts that Bitcoin is likely to exceed its previous highs within the first half of 2026. This is supported by ongoing net inflows into Spot ETPs and a cooling Federal Reserve policy.  3. The 20 Millionth BTC Milestone ⛓️ A massive psychological and supply event is coming: the 20 millionth Bitcoin is projected to be mined around March 2026. This reinforces Bitcoin’s transparent scarcity at a time when fiat currency debasement risks are rising.  4. Beyond Speculation: The core of the 2026 thesis is Integration. Expect:  Bipartisan crypto legislation in the U.S.  Deeper ties between public blockchains and Traditional Finance (TradFi).  Infrastructure growth over pure speculation.  The Big Question for the Community: Do you agree with Grayscale that the \"4-year cycle\" is dead, or are we just in a prolonged distribution phase before a deeper correction?

This isn’t leverage or fast money chasing momentum. It’s direct spot demand pulling real BTC out of circulation and parking it in long-term vehicles that aren’t reacting to every candle. Over time, that matters. Liquid supply tightens, downside volatility gets absorbed, and price discovery slowly shifts away from short-term speculation toward longer-term capital allocation. This is how Bitcoin starts behaving less like a trade and more like a balance-sheet asset. The impact doesn’t always show up immediately in price, but it shows up in structure and that’s where the real signal is.  ﻿Follow for more detailed analysis and insights ✓™. ﻿#Macro Insights#  #BTC","gravity_id":"372439827","id":59201,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T14:00:06.162Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T14:00:06.162Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T13:57:09.623Z","text_content":"BUY ALERT ‼️\n$BTC is still moving side ways 👀 everyone is just watching bitcoins next move where on other hands silver is making new highs 🚀\n#BTC90kChristmas","gravity_id":"372443178","id":59202,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T14:00:06.422Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T14:00:06.422Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T13:55:17.658Z","text_content":"📌 Crypto Outlook 2026: Grayscale’s thesis\n\n\nGrayscale’s 2026 report suggests $BTC could make new all-time highs in H1 2026, with the 20 millionth BTC milestone expected around March 2026.\n\n\nTheir broader view is that 2026 may be shaped less by short-term speculation and more by infrastructure growth, regulatory clarity, and deeper integration into traditional finance.\n\n\n#BTC #cryptomarket","gravity_id":"372440797","id":59203,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T14:00:06.707Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T14:00:06.707Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T13:55:02.958Z","text_content":"🌍 Crypto closes 2025 on a quiet win\r \r Markets ended the year slightly green ⭐️  \r Global cap near $3T, $BTC  around $88.4K, ETH steady near $2.9K. \r \r Sentiment turns cautiously upbeat heading into 2026, with some analysts watching for a possible “catch-up” move in Q2.  \r \r 💹 Meanwhile, #TAO  saw notable on-chain moves: withdrawals and deposits bouncing between Binance, hinting at whale positioning and possible staking shifts.  \r \r 🔧 Network talk continues around the dTAO upgrade, aiming to better reward strong subnets.  \r \r Slow and steady finish.

While the macro setup is screaming for a structural shift into a global reserve asset, the charts are flashing a warning we can’t ignore: the 200-week SMA.   Historically, every major bear market is confirmed when we hit a lower high at the 200-day average before gravity takes over. Some are calling for a flush back to the $60k–$70k range.   To a retail trader, that’s a nightmare; to a professional, that is the ultimate liquidity grab before the real liquidity bomb drops in late 2026. ​ My target remains a confident climb toward $150,000, but I’m analytically prepared for this mid-cycle retest of reality first.

Even diversified companies can’t escape market cycles yet.  When Bitcoin drops 30%, revenues often fall the same. Asset management, staking, and trading income are still priced directly off crypto valuations.   Key Points: • Revenue link: lower prices mean lower fees and activity • Industry gap: unlike TradFi, crypto lacks stable income streams • Buffer attempt: data centers and infrastructure reduce volatility   🏗 Galaxy’s infrastructure business is now rivaling crypto ops in value, but a full decoupling may take years.

With Bitcoin showing resilience near key support levels, I’m curious do you think $BTC   will break higher in the coming days, or consolidate further?  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372443557","id":59331,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T15:10:13.743Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T15:10:13.743Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T15:06:21.442Z","text_content":"$BTC bullish lesgooo","gravity_id":"372443550","id":59332,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T15:10:14.002Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T15:10:14.002Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T15:04:29.082Z","text_content":"🚨 Bitcoin Near Upper Bear Band  $BTC  hovers near the upper Bear Band, a level historically seen in late-cycle conditions 📉 Price stays above long-term support, but momentum is flattening ⚖️  Past cycles show touches here often lead to extended consolidation or distribution.

THE TECHNICAL OUTLOOK From a chart perspective, Bitcoin $BTC  remains in a long-term bullish market structure. Historical cycles show that post-halving years typically deliver the strongest upside momentum. If BTC holds above its higher-timeframe support zones, the next expansion phase could mirror previous post-halving rallies, with price discovery accelerating once prior ATHs are convincingly reclaimed.  LOOKING AT MACRO LANDSCAPE Macro conditions are slowly turning supportive. Global liquidity is expanding, rate cuts are back on the table, and institutional adoption continues to grow through ETFs, custody products, and corporate balance sheet exposure. Bitcoin’s fixed supply narrative becomes increasingly attractive in an environment of monetary easing and rising sovereign debt.  2026 PRICE OUTLOOK While volatility will remain part of the journey, a realistic macro-aligned projection places Bitcoin in the $150,000 – $250,000 range by 2026 under a bullish scenario. More aggressive cycle extensions could push price beyond that range if liquidity conditions strongly favor risk assets.  BOTTOM LINE Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset it’s evolving into a global macro hedge. The combination of supply shock, institutional demand, and long-term technical structure suggests the next major leg higher may still be ahead.  As always: zoom out, manage risk, and let structure not emotion guide conviction.","gravity_id":"372444822","id":59420,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T16:00:09.041Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T16:00:09.041Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T15:52:54.866Z","text_content":"📉 Why  $BTC Still Controls Crypto Revenues\n\nMichael Novogratz says crypto firms remain tightly tied to  $BTC price moves and that link won't fully break for another 3-4 years.\n\nWe've seen it before 📊\n\nWhen Bitcoin drops 30%, revenues across trading, staking, and asset management often fall just as fast.
