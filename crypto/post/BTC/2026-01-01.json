The recent move shows a clear impulse followed by a corrective leg, which is a normal behavior in a broader bullish structure. Price respected the lower support near 87,400–87,600, where buyers stepped in and prevented a deeper breakdown. This reaction suggests that demand is still active at these levels, and as long as BTC holds above this support band, a recovery toward the previous highs remains a valid scenario.\n\n\nFrom a long trade perspective, this zone can be considered a potential accumulation area with confirmation. If Bitcoin continues to build higher lows above 87,400 and reclaims 88,200–88,400, momentum can expand again toward 89,000 and possibly higher. However, failure to hold the current base would weaken the bullish structure. On the short trade side, the rejection from the 89k region highlights strong selling pressure, meaning any weak bounce into 88,800–89,200 could again attract sellers for a continuation move back toward 87,000 and below.\n\n\nShort Outlook:\nMarket is in a short-term consolidation phase after rejection. Holding above 87,400 favors a bounce, while a breakdown below this level may extend downside pressure toward lower supports.","gravity_id":"372450406","id":59695,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T19:10:07.360Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T19:10:07.360Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T19:01:45.054Z","text_content":"Forget the four year halving crash. 2026 is the year the Institutional Wall kills the bear market. \n\nCorporate Bitcoin holdings have crossed 1 million BTC. \n\nLarge scale floor-setting by ETFs and endowments has replaced 80% retail drawdowns with a structural grind upward. \n\nCrypto is no longer a trade. \n\nIt is a permanent alternative asset class.","gravity_id":"372447776","id":59696,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T19:10:07.629Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T19:10:07.629Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T19:01:45.052Z","text_content":"Bitcoin energy debates miss the point.\n\nThe question is simple 👇\n\nCan global money scale responsibly? 🌱\n\nBitcoin.ℏ says yes.\nThe Common Sense Bitcoin.\n🔗 https://bitcoin.org.ht ","gravity_id":"372448752","id":59697,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T19:10:07.901Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T19:10:07.901Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T19:17:07.958Z","text_content":"$BTC100 help 2026 $$$$","gravity_id":"372450474","id":59711,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T19:20:05.220Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T19:30:06.414Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T19:13:45.035Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nCoinbase’s Base faces builder backlash over creator coin push\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372447834","id":59712,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T19:20:05.492Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T19:30:06.675Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T19:11:58.089Z","text_content":"$BTC ETFs and institutional investors are absorbing the entire supply. \n\nDon’t be too late.\n\n#Bitcoin #ETFs  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372449474","id":59713,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T19:20:06.023Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T19:30:07.059Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T19:11:03.040Z","text_content":"Happy New Year 🥂\n\nNew year, same grind.\nNew lessons, fewer mistakes.\nLeaving the noise behind and keeping the vision clear.\n\nWishing growth, peace, and better decisions for everyone in 2026.\n $BTC","gravity_id":"372450443","id":59714,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T19:20:06.284Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T19:30:07.330Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2025-12-31T19:10:52.122Z","text_content":"Bitget is pushing boundaries again by making onchain stock trading completely fee-free, giving users direct access to tokenized stocks without paying extra trading fees.

Price is reacting around a major high-timeframe supply zone after a vertical push. The long upper wicks show clear rejection at higher levels, suggesting aggressive profit-taking rather than trend failure. This looks more like a cooldown phase than a full reversal.  From a structure perspective, BTC is still holding well above its prior breakout zone. As long as price continues to hold above that reclaimed range, the broader uptrend remains intact. A period of consolidation or sideways compression here would actually be constructive and allow momentum to reset.  The volume profile shows heavy acceptance much lower, meaning there’s strong historical participation below current price. That reduces downside risk unless we lose key support decisively.  Big picture: Momentum cooled, not broken. Volatility is expected, but the higher-timeframe trend still favors continuation as long as support holds.  Patience here matters.

Historically, 2026 should be \"post-peak,\" but the 2024 halving cycle is behaving differently. Here is my macro outlook for $BTC .  1. The Macro Engine: Liquidity > Halving In 2025, $BTC  decoupled from its traditional 4-year rhythm. Global Liquidity (M2) now moves the needle more than miner rewards. With central banks shifting to a neutral stance in early 2026, Bitcoin is the primary beneficiary of a weaker USD.  2. The Institutional \"Supply Squeeze\" We enter 2026 with exchange reserves at multi-year lows. Between Spot ETFs (holding ~5% of supply) and corporate treasuries, \"liquid\" supply is incredibly thin. Any surge in demand this year will cause a \"mechanical\" price spike—there simply isn't enough supply to absorb big buy orders.  3. Technical Support & Targets The end of 2025 gave us a healthy reset.  Key Support: $75k–$80k (The \"Institutional Floor\").  2026 Targets: * Base Case: $110k–$135k (Steady institutional grind).  Bull Case: $150k+ (Driven by a Supply Shock).  My Take: 2026 is the year of Sovereign and Institutional adoption. We are moving away from retail speculation toward global asset allocation.

Some models even see possibilities above $250K under optimal conditions.   🔸 Mid/Neutral Cases: Conservative forecasts cluster between $100k–$170K, assuming steady adoption but tempered macro liquidity and slower accumulation.   ⚠️ Bear Risks: Macro tightening, regulatory setbacks, or reduced institutional inflows could keep BTC in a $60K–$100k range, or even test deeper support levels in a strong bear regime.   📈 Macro Factors to Watch  Monetary Policy: Fed rates, liquidity cycles, and risk asset correlations will shape BTC demand.

Today MSTR holds $59 billion worth of BTC while its current market cap is $46 billion, so it’s now trading at a -20%-25% discount.  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372460576","id":60261,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:40.095Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:40.095Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T06:51:20.506Z","text_content":"This Long Term $BTC Chart Highlights Repeating Market Cycles, Showing How Previous Peaks Were Followed By Extended Correction Phases Before The Next Expansion Began 📊\n\nBased On Historical Structure And Time Based Patterns, The Chart Suggests That A Major Bottom Could Form Around The 2026 Period, With The $25,000 Zone Marked As A Potential Area Of Long Term Market Reset 👀\n\nSuch Cyclical Behavior Has Been Observed Across Multiple Bitcoin Market Phases, \n\nWhere Volatility Gradually Compresses Before Broader Trend Shifts Take Place.\nHow Do You Interpret This Cycle Based Structure?","gravity_id":"372460575","id":60262,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:40.366Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:40.366Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T06:49:42.720Z","text_content":"$BTC is going to crash to 72 or lower b4 big move","gravity_id":"372459612","id":60263,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:40.631Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:40.631Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T06:47:03.291Z","text_content":"Tether increases its  $BTC holdings by 8,888 BTC, showing strong confidence even as the market stays uncertain.\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372460553","id":60264,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:40.901Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:40.901Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T06:46:45.240Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nYesterday the US #Ethereum spot ETF saw a net outflow of $72 million\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372459596","id":60265,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:41.164Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:41.164Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T06:46:45.103Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nYesterday the US #Bitcoin Spot ETF saw a net outflow of $3.481 billion\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372459592","id":60266,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:41.797Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:41.797Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T06:46:45.101Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\n2025 Full Year US #Bitcoin Spot ETF Total Net Inflows: $229.426 Billion\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372460546","id":60267,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:42.092Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:42.092Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T06:46:31.419Z","text_content":"Happy New Year 🎊 \n\nI'm bullish on  $BTC\n#BTC","gravity_id":"372459590","id":60268,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:42.357Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T06:52:42.357Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T07:28:04.161Z","text_content":"$BTC opinions","gravity_id":"372460754","id":60278,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T07:30:08.684Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T07:30:08.684Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T07:28:03.439Z","text_content":"$BTC\n\nLIKE, IF YOU THINK #BITCOIN IS GOING TO $250,000 THIS NEW YEAR IN 2026.","gravity_id":"372460753","id":60279,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T07:30:08.953Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T07:30:08.953Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T07:23:52.237Z","text_content":"$BTC The last real divisible, portable, transaccional, scarce and fixed money supply left on planet earth.","gravity_id":"372460731","id":60280,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T07:30:09.221Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T07:30:09.221Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T07:18:08.469Z","text_content":"#ElSalvador  isn’t backing down on $BTC    The country just confirmed plans to go all-in on $BTC  and AI in 2026, doubling down on its long-term strategy despite years of criticism.

This tight structure suggests a high-probability accumulation zone, where price compression often precedes a major move. A clean break above the range would likely signal trend continuation, opening the door toward $105K+. On the flip side, a breakdown below support could trigger a liquidity sweep toward the $75K–$84K zone before any meaningful recovery. With volume drying up and volatility heavily compressed, the setup points to an explosive move ahead. 📊 Takeaway: Watch the range closely—$BTC  is coiling, and the next breakout or breakdown is likely to define the market’s next major direction.  ﻿Join us on Telegram: t.me/AlphaCryptoSignal  ﻿#CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#   ﻿#CMC Smart Quests#  #Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372460954","id":60341,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T08:20:10.796Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T08:20:10.796Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T08:39:05.474Z","text_content":"$BTC For this time its better take profit than waste profit.","gravity_id":"372461219","id":60351,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T08:40:05.548Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T08:40:05.548Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T08:36:25.948Z","text_content":"[{\"sourceId\":\"69563165e0fef6146f48655b\",\"tldr\":\"MicroStrategy may sell Bitcoin due to financial pressures, potentially increasing market volatility and influencing corporate strategies.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/6955152402623d25a2e96f59\",\"relevantWord\":\"MicroStrategy\",\"score\":\"8.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"69563164e0fef6146f486556\",\"tldr\":\"Bitcoin's ascent to $89,000 reflects robust institutional adoption and enhanced regulatory clarity boosting investor confidence.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/6955152429d479344efc35c1\",\"relevantWord\":\"Bitcoin's ascent to $89,000\",\"score\":\"8.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"6956315be0fef6146f486538\",\"tldr\":\"SEC considers adjusting tick sizes for Bitcoin ETF options to enhance market liquidity and price discovery, signifying regulatory improvements.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/6954f902b63e53669e97cb7f\",\"relevantWord\":\"SEC\",\"score\":\"8.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"6956313ee0fef6146f4864e5\",\"tldr\":\"Spot Bitcoin ETFs see $355 million inflows, driven by BlackRock, Ark Invest, and Fidelity, indicating substantial institutional interest and market bullishness.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/69556983e05bdf5878621018\",\"relevantWord\":\"Spot Bitcoin ETFs\",\"score\":\"8.0\"}]","gravity_id":"372462153","id":60352,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T08:40:05.815Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T08:40:05.815Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T08:31:45.042Z","text_content":"GM ☀️ CoinRank Early Briefing!\n\nFlow: An exchange exhibited abnormal trading activity during the FLOW security incident, shifting the risk to users.\n\nVitalik @VitalikButerin  changed his X profile picture to one related to Milady Maker.\n\nPeter Schiff: #Strategy's strategy of buying Bitcoin destroyed shareholder value.\n\n#Trustwallet CEO: Wallet plugins are temporarily unavailable for download from the Chrome Web Store; a new feature has been added allowing attacked users to submit verification codes.\n\nUS Department of Justice: Approximately 5.2 million pages of documents remain pending in the Epstein case.\n\n#CoinRank #GM","gravity_id":"372461157","id":60353,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T08:40:06.080Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T08:40:06.080Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T08:29:14.485Z","text_content":"$BTC  Update  The Falling Wedge pattern has formed, and it is now poised to break out on the 1D time frame ⏰.

Never since the start of this chart has Bitcoin closed more than three consecutive months red.\n\nIn 2021 at the orthodox end of the bullish cycle, Bitcoin closed three months red and then turned bullish for four months. In November 2021 at the start of the previous bear market, after closing three months red, Bitcoin produced a relief rally closing then two months green.\n\nThe 2022 bear market climax was composed of three consecutive red months but never more. Then the market settled creating a bottom, sideways-consolidation, a reversal followed by a massive bullish cycle.\n\nSince April-June 2022, it is the first time Bitcoin is trading three consecutive months red. This isn't bullish, but it calls for a relief rally at the least and this relief rally can last several months.\n\nAfter the relief rally comes the lower low, the consummation of the bear market. It can happen that it goes straight down but this isn't likely, it has never happened before.\n\nThe month is yet to close. The open happened at $90,420. Above this level, the months closes green, below red.\n\nI am predicting small up (1) followed by strong down (2) based on this chart, the three months rule and the altcoins market. The biggest signal comes from the altcoins.\n\nIt can happen that Bitcoin continues neutral and only next month we see the start of strong volatility and bullish action. The market manipulators will need to continue suppressing the altcoins.

His role in the early days was so pivotal that many still speculate he was Satoshi, though he denied it until his death.\n * The Final Departure: Satoshi’s last public technical post was on December 12, 2010, regarding DoS security. His final private communication was in April 2011, where he told developers he had \"moved on to other things.\"\nThe 2014 \"Reappearances\"\nAfter years of silence, Satoshi’s accounts became active during the Newsweek controversy:\n * \"I am not Dorian Nakamoto\": In March 2014, Satoshi’s P2P Foundation account posted this single sentence to deny that Dorian Nakamoto was the creator.\n * The 2014 Hack: Later that year, Satoshi’s GMX email was compromised. A hacker used the account to post warnings/threats, leading the community to disregard any non-cryptographically signed messages from that era.\nThe \"Nour\" Mystery (2018)\nIn November 2018, the P2P Foundation account posted the word \"nour\" (Arabic/Hebrew for \"light\") and added a Brazilian user as a friend. Because the linked email had been previously hacked, this is widely considered a hoax rather than a return of the real creator.\nThe Genesis Coins\n * The 1.1 Million BTC: Satoshi is estimated to own over a million Bitcoin. These coins have not moved since 2010.\n * The Genesis Block: The original 50 BTC reward from the first block (Jan 3, 2009) is permanently unspendable due to a quirk in the original code.\n * Recent Activity: While Satoshi’s coins remain still, 2024 and 2025 saw several \"Satoshi-era\" wallets (from 2009/2010) wake up and move billions in BTC, though none have been linked to Satoshi’s specific mining pattern.\n\nThank you Satoshi.

As the crypto market matures, such structured and resilient accumulation methods reflect a shift toward smarter capital management, positioning investors to benefit when market conditions eventually reverse.\n\n#MichaelSaylor #BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372463140","id":60438,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T10:20:06.587Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T10:20:06.587Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T10:07:03.909Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $BTC  The cycle start target changed to  91873 usd","gravity_id":"372463137","id":60439,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T10:20:06.884Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T10:20:06.884Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T10:06:53.849Z","text_content":"Welcome to 2026! 🎆  Will this be a good year for $BTC ?

It’s been a brutal environment, and pretending otherwise doesn’t help anyone.\n\n\nThe data, however, hasn’t disappeared. Altseason isn’t a belief system — it’s a function of rotation. Capital moves down the risk curve: cash → equities → commodities → higher-beta assets. That behaviour hasn’t changed. 📈\n\n\nGold, silver, and commodities have already led.\nAltcoins are not exempt — they respond when liquidity reaches them.\n\n\nThe important point most miss: a year of damage can be erased in weeks. When liquidity flows down the chain, alt markets don’t recover gradually — they move through short, violent, parabolic expansions that compress months of downside into a handful of candles.\n\n\nI’ll also be transparent: pushing optimistic TA into a clear downtrend hasn’t been productive, and it’s not what this account should be doing. Structure leads. Liquidity decides.\n\n\nWith easing financial conditions, policy support, and geopolitical pressure starting to ease, 2026 presents a materially better backdrop. 🧭\n\n\nThis isn’t about excitement.\n\n\nIt’s about being ready before the candles arrive. 🎯\n\n\n2026 will be a better year.\n\n\n— Urxrl (Eric)\n\n\n#UrxrlTrading #CryptoMarkets #Altcoins #MarketStructure $BTC","gravity_id":"372466151","id":60469,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T10:40:11.982Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T10:40:11.982Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T10:35:24.958Z","text_content":"#Bitcoin has taken a clear hit in recent months, with a sharp pullback contrasting strongly against traditional markets. Since early November, $XAUT has climbed 9% and the S&P 500 is up 1%, while $BTC has corrected roughly 20%. For many investors, this divergence looks less like weakness and more like a classic reset phase after an overheated run.\nHistorically, periods where Bitcoin lags behind traditional assets have often preceded powerful catch-up moves. Analysts increasingly view this drawdown as a compression zone, where patience is tested before momentum returns.\nWith macro conditions evolving and regulatory clarity gradually improving, 2026 is shaping up as a potential re-acceleration year for Bitcoin and the wider crypto market.\nIf that rebound plays out, the upside impact could be significant. A recovery in Bitcoin would likely restore confidence, unlock sidelined capital, and reaffirm crypto's role as a long-term alternative asset. For bullish investors, this phase isn't the end of the story it may be the setup.\n\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights# #Altcoin Season# #Meme Alpha#","gravity_id":"372467142","id":60470,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T10:40:12.146Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T10:40:12.146Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T10:34:45.071Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nOpinion AI Oracle Suffers Context Pollution Leading to Incorrect Judgment, Team to Fully Reimburse\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372466132","id":60471,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T10:40:12.309Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T10:40:12.309Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T10:34:45.059Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nIf #Ethereum drops below $2900, the mainstream CEX long liquidation pressure will reach $784 million.\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372466130","id":60472,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T10:40:12.474Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T10:40:12.474Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T10:34:45.052Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\n#Binance will delist the $BTC/RON spot trading pair, where RON is a fiat currency.\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372463249","id":60473,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T10:40:12.637Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T10:40:12.637Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T11:01:45.047Z","text_content":"Tether amplifies its influence in the crypto market with the acquisition of 8,888 BTC, now holding over 96,000, making it the fifth-largest Bitcoin wallet.\n\n📖 Read more: https://coin.news/crypto/tether-bolsters-bitcoin-holdings-with-8888-btc-acquisition/","gravity_id":"372464313","id":60481,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T11:02:28.201Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T11:02:28.201Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T11:01:34.185Z","text_content":"Market indecision is where asymmetric bets are born. $BTC","gravity_id":"372463356","id":60482,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T11:02:28.408Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T11:02:28.408Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T11:00:00.167Z","text_content":"🚀 Crypto Outlook 2026: Insights from Grayscale\r \r \r As we approach the end of the year and prepare to welcome 2026, it is an opportune moment to consider what lies ahead for the cryptocurrency market.

Its value is derived entirely from trust and government mandate. If every nation backed their currency with Bitcoin, it would create a global \"Bitcoin Standard,\" effectively modernizing the old Gold Standard for the digital age. This would be a radical shift from our current fiat system, where governments can print money as needed.\n​Here is what that world would likely look like:\n​The Death of \"Infinite Printing\"\n​Currently, central banks use monetary policy to manage the economy (e.g., printing money during a recession). With a Bitcoin backing:\n​Hard Supply Cap: Governments could only issue as much local currency as they have Bitcoin to back it.\n​No Inflationary \"Stimulus\": Governments could no longer \"print their way out\" of debt. This would force extreme fiscal discipline but could also lead to deeper recessions because the government loses its \"safety valve\" to inject cash into the system. Unlike the US Dollar, which loses value over time, Bitcoin is designed to increase in purchasing power because of its scarcity (21 million cap).\n​Psychology of Spending: If your money is worth more tomorrow than it is today, you are less likely to spend it. While this encourages saving, it can slow down \"GDP growth\" because the economy relies on constant consumption.\n​Lower Prices: Over decades, the prices of goods would likely trend downward as technology makes production more efficient while the money supply remains fixed. 🌎🐂","gravity_id":"372467569","id":60603,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T12:30:05.914Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T12:30:05.914Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T12:24:35.293Z","text_content":"📉 Over the past 24 hours, #bitcoin dropped 1.1% to $87,682 amid a broader crypto market cooldown (–0.79%) and declining risk appetite (Fear & Greed Index at 31 – \"Fear\").\nKey reasons:\n1️⃣ Technical bearish breakdown: $BTC fell below key moving averages and the $92,202 Fibonacci retracement level.\n2️⃣ Market caution: Declining open interest, ETF outflows (–$635M), and weak altcoin performance.\n3️⃣ Institutional ambivalence: Tether bought $850M worth of BTC, yet ETFs continue to see outflows.\n🔍 What’s next?

Unlike traditional gold, $BTC  is permissionless, easily transferable, and globally accessible—qualities that make it increasingly attractive in a world facing monetary debasement and financial uncertainty. As adoption grows, many investors are beginning to see $BTC  as a hedge, not just a trade. 💡 Takeaway: If the “Gold 2.0” thesis continues to gain traction, $BTC  could play an even bigger role in global portfolios, reshaping how value is stored and transferred in the years ahead.  ﻿Join us on Telegram: t.me/AlphaCryptoSignal  ﻿#CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#  #CMC Smart Quests#  #Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372465187","id":60771,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T14:10:06.165Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T14:10:06.165Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T14:07:45.072Z","text_content":"The story of Bitcoin in 2025 was not just a higher price.\n\nParticipation broadened, capital moved with conviction, and Bitcoin behaved less like a fringe asset and more like a form of financial infrastructure.\n\n2026 is when understanding that shift starts to matter.

The 2025 structure has that same double-top vibe we saw in 2021: big breakout → sharp rejection → another push near the highs that struggles to accelerate… and then a quick drop back into the range (now around ~$87k). It’s not a perfect copy, but the character is familiar: volatility expands at the top, price gets choppy, and momentum starts to look “spent.”  The big difference vs last cycle: market structure is stronger (ETFs + easier access + more institutional flow). That can make dips shallower and bases firmer. But macro still decides the ending — rates, liquidity, and risk appetite determine whether BTC gets a 2026 continuation leg or a longer unwind like post-2021.  My 2026 scenarios + targets  1) Reset, then continuation (base case / bullish): This is a mid-cycle shakeout, BTC builds higher lows, liquidity improves. Target: ~$150k–$220k in 2026 (with overshoot potential in a true risk-on wave).  2) 2021 rhyme (neutral-to-bearish): Double top resolves into a longer drawdown/grind, rallies get sold, recovery takes time. Range: ~$90k–$140k as a “rebuild year” rather than a moonshot.  3) Macro shock (bearish tail risk): Liquidity tightens or risk-off hits and BTC trades like high beta again. Range: ~$70k–$120k, with the bigger expansion pushed later.  My take: the double top similarity is real—which is why I’m treating 2026 as “continuation if the base holds,” not “new highs are guaranteed.” 😎","gravity_id":"372469339","id":60865,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T15:20:43.419Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T15:20:43.419Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T15:09:36.728Z","text_content":"If you check the $BTC  price today after 3 weeks, you'll find nothing has changed.

SEC launches a safe harbor the same month, ending regulation by enforcement. California mandates licensing for digital asset firms by July 1, CFTC finalizes tokenized collateral rules in August, and the GENIUS Act sets federal stablecoin reserve standards by mid-July. Congress faces its biggest test yet on delivering crypto clarity after years of delays.\n\n3/9\n🇹🇲 Turkmenistan\n\nTurkmenistan flips the switch on crypto exchanges and mining operations on Jan. 1, formally legalizing digital asset businesses. The Central Asian nation joins the licensing wave as exchanges prepare to onboard traders and miners set up operations.

Wholesale CBDC pilots tokenize government bills as Singapore expands blockchain infrastructure in public finance. The city-state doubles down on its lead in Asia-Pacific digital asset frameworks.\n\n5/9\n🇭🇰 Hong Kong\n\nHong Kong enforces Basel crypto capital rules for banks Jan. 1, giving favorable treatment to certain stablecoins and codifying exposures. HKMA and SFC roll out stablecoin issuer licenses plus expanded VA dealer and custodian regimes early in the year, broadening market access while tightening compliance. The fight with Singapore for Asia's crypto crown enters a decisive phase.\n\n6/9\n🇨🇳 China\n\nChina flips digital yuan wallets into interest-bearing accounts on Jan. 1, making the e-CNY competitive with bank deposits as the PBoC doubles down on CBDC adoption and pushes back against crypto. Commercial banks can now pay interest on verified balances, shifting the e-CNY from payment tool to deposit-like instrument. The state-controlled digital currency play gets its most aggressive feature yet.\n\n7/9\n🇷🇺 Russia\n\nRussia enacts a unified crypto framework July 1, licensing exchanges and depositories while banning privacy coins and capping retail exposure.
