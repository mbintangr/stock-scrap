With $BTC  at the center, growing regulatory clarity and rising institutional inflows are creating the conditions for a renewed uptrend rather than a prolonged downturn. As large players continue to enter the space, confidence around $BTC  as a core macro asset is building. This shift suggests that, instead of a deep freeze, the market could be setting up for new all-time highs, supported by policy frameworks and long-term capital. 💡 Takeaway: If regulation and institutions continue to align, $BTC  may lead crypto into its next expansion phase—making a 2026 Crypto Winter far less likely than many expect.  ﻿Join us on Telegram: t.me/AlphaCryptoSignal  ﻿#CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#  #CMC Smart Quests#  #Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372472195","id":61118,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T18:00:08.386Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T18:00:08.386Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-01T18:06:06.358Z","text_content":"2026: Institutions FINALLY get it. 😂 They're all about $BTC , stablecoins, & RWAs now.

According to CryptoQuant, a rally toward $170,000 is possible - but it’s the least likely scenario right now.  🔍 Key Takeaways:  • Bull Case (Low Probability): $BTC  could push into the $120K–$170K range if rate-cut expectations return early and ETF inflows stay strong.  • Base Case (High Probability): With mixed macro signals and short-term ETF flows, Bitcoin may trade in a wide $80K–$140K range, with $90K–$120K as the core zone.  • Risk Case (Medium Probability): A macro shock or recession fears could trigger deleveraging and ETF outflows, opening downside below $80K.  📊 Bottom Line: CryptoQuant says the market remains neutral to slightly bearish. What matters most now is how ETF flows, exchange reserves, and derivatives data move together, not in isolation. #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372480047","id":61581,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T00:50:07.329Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T00:50:07.329Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-02T00:43:45.059Z","text_content":"When the Kremlin says \"no mining without a permit,\" just remember: even $BTC needs to follow the rules! 😂💼 \n\nDon't worry, it's just their way of saying \"let's keep it legal.\"  \n\n👉 https://coinlive.me/p/russia-fines-illegal-crypto-mining.webm  \n\n#CryptoRegulations #Bitcoin #Mining #Russia 🪙","gravity_id":"372480045","id":61582,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T00:50:07.602Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T00:50:07.602Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-02T00:42:41.236Z","text_content":"Turkmenistan legalizes crypto.

Currently, STH realized profit and loss has fallen back into negative territory, with the aggregate profit/loss margin hovering around -12%, despite Bitcoin price remaining relatively elevated compared to prior cycles.   Historically, sustained periods where STHs operate at a loss tend to coincide with either late-stage corrections or consolidation phases within broader uptrends. This dynamic reflects rising sell-side pressure from newer market participants who entered at higher prices and are now underwater, increasing sensitivity to short-term price fluctuations.  Notably, Bitcoin price is still trading close to the STH realized price, suggesting that the market is testing an important behavioral support zone. In past cycles, sharp expansions in STH losses often preceded volatility spikes, either flushing out weak  hands or marking transitional phases before trend continuation.  From a macro-on-chain perspective, the absence of extreme STH losses similar to  2018 or mid-2022 implies that structural damage remains limited so far. However, the persistence of negative STH margins signals fragility in short-term demand and highlights the importance of monitoring whether losses deepen or begin to compress.  In short, short-term holders are once again under pressure. The next directional move is likely to be defined by whether STH profitability can recover quickly or slips further, amplifying downside volatility.   #CryptoZeno  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372489028","id":62007,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T10:10:05.900Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T10:10:05.900Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-02T10:08:15.229Z","text_content":"INSIGHTS:\nWHALES ARE BACK.\n\nAddresses holding 1,000+  $BTC just flipped from net-selling to heavy accumulation again.\n\nRetail watches price.\nWhales watch liquidity.\nAnd right now... they're stepping back in.","gravity_id":"372490031","id":62008,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T10:10:06.072Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T10:10:06.072Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-02T10:08:10.003Z","text_content":"$BTC  flow in the market year update: Start 2025 first month BTC did increase from 92K-102K And in 2024 from 42K-45 K and in 2023 from 15K to 23K..

It’s important to note that we have frequently witnessed a quick loss of strength within this current trading range, so maintaining a cautious approach is advisable.\n\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Crypto# #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372496778","id":62705,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:15.327Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:15.327Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-02T17:07:45.066Z","text_content":"Bitcoin ETFs Record $4.57 Billion Outflows in Final Two Months of 2025📊⚠️\n\nTo Know More👇\nhttps://thenewscrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-record-4-57-billion-outflows-in-final-two-months-of-2025/\n\n#BitcoinETF #BTC","gravity_id":"372497417","id":62706,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:15.504Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:15.504Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-02T17:07:45.050Z","text_content":"Bitcoin Surges Back to $90,000: What Lies Ahead? https://ift.tt/dR9z7cS","gravity_id":"372495791","id":62707,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:15.682Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:15.682Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-02T17:07:45.045Z","text_content":"Whales Fuel Bitcoin Buzz amidst On-Chain Data Misinterpretation https://ift.tt/eoarxwg","gravity_id":"372496775","id":62708,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:15.859Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:15.859Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-02T17:07:00.050Z","text_content":"🇺🇸 JPMorgan says #Bitcoin has strong support around $94,000 and still sees a potential move toward $170,000 ahead.    \n\nBullish 🚀  $BTC","gravity_id":"372496772","id":62709,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:16.033Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:16.033Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-02T17:06:28.419Z","text_content":"🇸🇻 BULLISH: El Salvador is doubling down on $BTC  and AI in 2026, making them key pillars of its national strategy, according to The Bitcoin Office a bold move that signals continued commitment to innovation and digital assets. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"372496765","id":62710,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:16.207Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:16.207Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-02T17:05:02.568Z","text_content":"$BTC  WASH TRADE ALERT!!!!","gravity_id":"372497399","id":62711,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:16.382Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:16.382Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-02T17:04:45.535Z","text_content":"In a landmark moment for digital assets, Bitcoin (BTC) has decisively broken through the $90,000 barrier, trading at $90,037 on the Binance USDT market as of today, March 21, 2025. ##Markets #BITCOIN #CRYPTOCURRENCY #Finance #Technology\nhttps://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-surges-past-90000-milestone/ ","gravity_id":"372498324","id":62712,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:16.557Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T17:11:16.557Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-02T17:28:06.423Z","text_content":"Whales are buying $BTC   like madmen!  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372495942","id":62734,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T17:30:05.625Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T17:30:05.625Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-02T17:27:23.106Z","text_content":"$BTC Dominance\n\n\nAccording to the Ichi Cloud we will find a major direction in the next 4 weeks.\n\n\nWe still believe in #altcoins outperformance, but only once we get the BTC D confirmed downside move. 📉📉📉 #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"372495940","id":62735,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T17:30:05.905Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T17:30:05.905Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-02T17:26:59.493Z","text_content":"$BTC Update by Lorena Zeus dm and follow her up on TikTok for more tops she said $BITF The Bitcoin mining industry still appears undervalued.
