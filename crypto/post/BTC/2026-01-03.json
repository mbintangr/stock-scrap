This is the main move and the start of the downtrend for the Bitcoin Dominance index.\n\nThe main low happened 24-August 2025. This is to say, that the market as a whole, Bitcoin and the altcoins, were in bullish territory until August, at that point the market entered a full blown bearish bias. As the market moved down, Bitcoin and the altcoins, the Bitcoin Dominance index (BTCDOMUSDT) started to move up.\n\nBTCDOMUSDT has been rising since 24-August 2025. It peaked 10-October 2025 and then started to produce lower highs signaling that the bullish bias was losing strength.\n\nBitcoin Dominance stopped growing completely in early November, the 4th, and started to move sideways. It failed to break resistance over and over. The resistance zone is clearly depicted on this chart.\n\nNow, after 194 days, we have the start of a new bearish wave. So the first wave-down was in June 2025 and the next one starts now, January 2026. This means that the altcoins market is about to produce a huge bullish cycle, Bitcoin will also grow. As Bitcoin Dominance goes down, everything Crypto grows.\n\nIf you like the SHORT side of a trade, here you have a set of trade-numbers for this trading pair.

If you only trade top assets like $BTC , you might not have felt it much. But for on-chain traders, the change was obvious.  The move toward a Universal Exchange opened the door to more than just crypto, making it possible to explore different asset classes, including stocks, all in one place. Having that level of flexibility and convenience within a single platform is a huge win for me.  What really stands out is how Bitget continues to support on-chain traders. Regular campaigns like the Bitget Onchain Challenge let you trade on-chain tokens such as $RAVE , BABAon, and CRCLon while stacking BGB rewards. Trading and earning at the same time just hits different. ﻿#Meme Alpha#  #BNBChain#","gravity_id":"372512064","id":63395,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T01:50:25.161Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T02:00:08.579Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-03T01:40:45.041Z","text_content":"🚨 INSIGHT: Bitcoin enters 2026 without a clear trend, with a volatile $80K–$140K range seen as the most likely outcome.

In this situation, we can expect at least three waves driven by the bear, or even up to five waves visible through price pattern comparisons.  A potential scenario that could happen with Bitcoin in 2026 and what might be expected in 2027 and the following years $BTC    A price pattern created on a larger chart ten or even fifteen years ago shows strong similarities with Bitcoin's pattern.  · Both major declines (\"crashes\") lasted approximately the same duration. · The first decline was stronger than the second – the correction waves were weak, and the bear had predominant strength. · The second decline saw much more struggle between the bear and the bull, where it was clearer to see waves 2 and 4 showing stronger force from the bull's side.  The average upward wave also shows similarity: a pre-rise (marked with a pink arc) is visible, followed by five waves upward. After that, the price holds approximately at the same level for some time, after which a strong selling wave, or wave 1, begins, followed by a five-wave correction.  Based on this, it could also be said that the bottom of this decline may be above $50,000, where the movement could see the previous all-time high (ATH) as a good support point.

In the UK, where creator Satoshi Nakamoto is believed to have lived, this was early evening.\nThe Hidden Message\nSatoshi embedded a famous headline into the block's coinbase parameter: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\" This acted as a \"proof of date\" and a critique of the traditional financial system. Technically, this was hidden by converting the text into hexadecimal code (54 68 65 20 54 69 6d 65 73...), which is invisible to the software but readable by humans using block explorers.\nThe Unspendable 50 BTC\nThe original 50 BTC reward can never be spent. This is because the Genesis block was hardcoded into the software, but the code skips adding its transaction to the UTXO set (the database of valid, spendable coins). Any attempt to move them would be rejected by the network. This remains one of Bitcoin's greatest technical quirks—whether intentional or a minor bug.\nThe 21 Million Cap\nThe total supply of Bitcoin will never actually reach 21 million. Due to the math of the halving cycle (the reward cutting in half every 210,000 blocks), the maximum possible supply is 20,999,999.9769 BTC.\nThe supply is even lower in practice because:\n * The Genesis 50: Those first coins are excluded from the spendable supply.\n * Rounding: The reward eventually hits the 8th decimal place and rounds down to zero.\n * Human Error: Early miners occasionally claimed lower rewards than permitted or lost access to their keys.\nThe final satoshi is projected to be mined around the year 2140, after which miners will rely entirely on transaction fees.","gravity_id":"372515444","id":63659,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T07:50:07.177Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T07:50:07.177Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-03T07:43:45.059Z","text_content":"BTC Live Price ","gravity_id":"372516332","id":63660,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T07:50:07.397Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T07:50:07.397Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-03T07:43:45.053Z","text_content":"$BTC Breakout Confirmed After Multi-Month Consolidation\nAfter months of sideways movement and retracements, #Bitcoin finally demonstrated a decisive breakout.

This mismatch between the CME and the Spot market creates a fascinating phenomenon called the CME Gap. This is one of the most reliable indicators of money flow direction.\n\nFor Example.....\n🔸 The CME closes on Friday afternoon and reopens on Monday morning.\nCME closes Friday with Bitcoin at $60,000. Over the weekend, good news breaks, and Bitcoin pumps to $62,000.\nWhen CME reopens on Monday, the open price is $62,000. A price gap from $60,000 to $62,000 appears on the chart.\n\n🔸 Historical statistics show that about 90 to 95% of CME Gaps eventually get Filled. This means the price will reverse back to the $60,000 zone to close that void before resuming the main trend.\n\nIt is driven by Arbitrage Bots and Institutional Market Makers working to balance books and liquidity between Futures and Spot markets. The Gap acts as a magnet pulling the price back.\n🔹 If early in the week you see Bitcoin pumping hard, creating a large CME Gap below, do not FOMO. It is highly likely a Fake Pump.\nPatiently place Limit Buy orders right at the old Gap zone. Institutional money tends to come back to pick up the most patient passengers at this station.\nOpen the CME Bitcoin Futures chart. Are there any unfilled Gaps below? If so, would you bet on price returning there to pick you up, or do you believe this time is different?\nNews is for reference, not investment advice.

As we enter the weekend, with Bitcoin hovering near the range highs, I am closely monitoring for a definitive breakout above $90k or a potential retest towards the $88k - $87k zone.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights# #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372521902","id":64166,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T13:30:05.936Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T13:30:05.936Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-03T13:29:06.660Z","text_content":"$BTC now super bullish MNTC","gravity_id":"372522876","id":64167,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T13:30:06.225Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T13:30:06.225Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-03T13:28:45.309Z","text_content":"TRUMP FUNDING FROM AI & CRYPTO? 🤯 $BTC  gonna moon regardless, but this is some next-level galaxy brain stuff.

By taking the opposite side of EigenAI’s signals, it benefited from a period where EigenAI’s was largely mistaken, allowing the counter agent to capture several strong moves.\n\n@deepseek_ai had a difficult week, giving back a large portion of its previous gains after being caught on the wrong side of intraday reversals. Despite the drawdown, it continued to trade actively rather than remaining flat, and now sits below Counter EigenAI on the leaderboard.\n\nCounter Deepseek managed to have a good week, overtaking EigenAI, @OpenAI and counter GPT-5. Although Deepseek itself struggled, simply inverting its signals did not result in huge gains, suggesting its gains were driven more by noise than by a consistently exploitable bias\n\nEigenAI also underperformed over the week.

True whale holdings actually declined in December, as top wallets sold or reduced positions according to CryptoQuant research.  This underlines how tricky whale metrics can be: exchange consolidations often mimic accumulation, skewing on-chain interpretation.

Presidential memecoins and fresh all-time highs gave way to trade wars, historic $BTC  liquidations, and sweeping rule changes that reshaped the entire crypto industry. Volatility wasn’t just present — it was the theme. Crypto has clearly moved beyond the “niche” phase. It was debated in U.S. Congress, embedded into political strategies, and forced lawmakers to rewrite legislation. The market cycled through euphoria, brutal crashes, and a hard reset of expectations, separating speculation from conviction. While some chased fast multiples, others quietly built for the next phase — anchored in stablecoins, tokenization, institutional capital, and real-world products.

What’s going on?  Everyone’s glued to the $90,000 mark like it’s some kind of final boss. Bitcoin dipped below it, snapped right back, even as the news kept getting messier. On Binance, $BTC   jumped back above $90K. CoinDesk spotted a quick dip toward the high $89Ks, then the bounce.  Let’s talk about what’s happening under the hood. On January 2, the New York Fed pumped $22.8 billion through overnight repos—$19.5B in Treasuries, $3.3B in mortgage-backed securities. This isn’t a rate cut. It’s a temporary fix, the sort of thing that keeps the gears turning when cash is tight.  Take a step back and it gets more interesting. At year end, banks tapped the Fed’s repo facility for a record $74.6 billion—basically grabbing overnight dollars from the backstop. That’s why crypto traders keep saying, “follow the liquidity.”  And don’t forget, the Fed started buying T-bills for “reserve management” in December. Powell called it a technical move to keep reserves fat. Arthur Hayes calls this RMP and says it acts like QE for scarce assets, even if the Fed won’t admit it.  Then, out of nowhere, the headline: President Trump said Maduro and his wife got captured and flown out of Venezuela. AG Pam Bondi posted they were indicted in New York on narco-terrorism and drug charges. Markets hate that kind of chaos, so Bitcoin holding steady actually means something.  Here’s how I see it: Bitcoin’s trading like a liquidity thermometer. If the money keeps flowing, dips get bought up fast. If things tighten up, expect uglier drops.  So, what’s $90K to you—resistance, or the launchpad?","gravity_id":"372524458","id":64392,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T15:40:06.734Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T15:40:06.734Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-03T15:34:45.040Z","text_content":"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\n\nThe most important string of text in financial history.\nHappy Birthday, Bitcoin. 🟧 ","gravity_id":"372524456","id":64393,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T15:40:06.966Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T15:40:06.966Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-03T15:33:27.147Z","text_content":"📊 BTC$BTC  Analysis Update\r \r \r Price is starting to move toward the short liquidity we talked about earlier this week, sitting around 94K.
