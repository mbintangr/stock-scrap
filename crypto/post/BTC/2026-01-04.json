While \"risk-on\" assets often sell off during military escalations, Bitcoin’s performance during the current U.S. action in Venezuela highlights its emerging status as a \"Geopolitical Neutral\" asset. As reported, Bitcoin prices remained steady near the $90,000 mark even as headlines broke regarding the capture of Maduro.  This resilience is particularly notable because traditional markets are closed over the weekend, leaving Bitcoin as the only major liquid asset where participants can express a real-time risk view.   The lack of an aggressive sell-off suggests that the market views this event as a local restructuring rather than a global contagion risk. For the 2026 institutional holder, $BTC  Bitcoin is increasingly serving as the \"liquidity of last resort\" during high-tension weekends when banks and stock exchanges are inaccessible.  #Bitcoin  #Geopolitics  #USVenezuela  #MarketResilience  #Crypto2026","gravity_id":"372529906","id":64955,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T22:20:05.351Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T22:30:07.100Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-03T22:19:28.672Z","text_content":"Imagine learning about $BTC and digital assets in school instead of discovering them through losses later in life.\n\nIf the UAE is moving education in this direction, it’s a strong sign that crypto isn’t going away, it’s being normalized. #Bitcoin #BTC","gravity_id":"372530733","id":64956,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T22:20:05.649Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T22:30:07.403Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-03T22:15:19.227Z","text_content":"$BTC only reason we might not dump again, is because we are bombing Venezuela 🤣🤡🌎","gravity_id":"372530709","id":64957,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T22:20:05.950Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T22:30:07.588Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-03T22:13:45.041Z","text_content":"Metaplanet's yen-funded Bitcoin strategy projected to deliver 4-6x higher equity value versus dollar competitors over 20 years. \n\nLow 4.9% coupons and currency tailwinds create 17.5% net growth compared to 7-10% for USD-based rivals.\n\n#Bitcoin #BTC #Metaplanet #CryptoStrategy\n\n👉Full Story👇\n\nhttps://t.co/jJ3LtEglmh","gravity_id":"372529881","id":64959,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T22:20:06.554Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T22:20:06.554Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-03T22:11:34.813Z","text_content":"Possible scenario for $BTC .

The 4H timeframe shows a controlled pullback from the mid-December highs near $94,000–$95,000, with price now compressing at this demand area.

What makes this rally different is how it’s happening. There’s no euphoria, no retail frenzy — just steady positioning.  🔹 Spot demand is improving while selling pressure continues to fade, a combination typically seen during early accumulation phases.  🔹 On-chain data shows long-term holders are staying put, suggesting confidence rather than distribution.  🔹 Derivatives activity is rising, but without excessive leverage — indicating participation, not speculation.  Big picture? Bitcoin is behaving like a market leader again. Volatility is compressing, sellers are stepping back, and capital is quietly rotating into BTC before the narrative fully shifts.  This doesn’t look like a short-term pump. It looks like the market resetting its base.

Watching Trump and the US take over Venezuela, while regulators try to figure out what's happening. The future is here, and it's a wild, unregulated ride.

Bitcoin Rides the Institutional \"Trillions\" Wave!\n\nHey Investor, here is the essence of the recent market movements:\n\n💡 1. The Major Force: $1.4 Trillion in ETFs\nETFs (traditional investment funds) in the United States recorded record net flows of $1.4 trillion in 2025.\n\nThis massive inflow means that \"smart money\" and institutional capital are strongly entering regulated markets.\n\nConclusion: An increasing portion of these trillions will be allocated to BTC because it is now considered a fundamental asset for hedging.\n\n📈 2. Bitcoin Performance: Confirmation of Confidence\nCurrent Price: Bitcoin is trading at approximately 91,096, showing a good rise (over 1.09\\%).\n\nStrong Momentum: The price action is stabilizing above key moving averages (like the MA(200)), and this is an indicator of quiet, long-term accumulation rather than mere speculation.\n\nMarket Message: The stability above 90,000 confirms that institutions (influenced by the ETF flows) view this level as a \"new floor\" for purchasing.\n\n🎯 What Does This Mean for You?\n\nWhen trillions of dollars (1.4 trillion) acknowledge the value of your asset class, prices follow suit. Bitcoin's current rise is a logical reflection of the sheer volume of liquidity in the financial system as a whole.\n\nDon't focus on daily volatility; focus on this number: 1.4 Trillion. This is the real driving force!\n\n#Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#  #ETF #Crypto #MarketAnalysis \n $BTC","gravity_id":"372534944","id":65202,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T02:30:08.067Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T02:30:08.067Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T02:49:45.073Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nFlow: The network has fully recovered and plans to release the attack event analysis report within 48 hours\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372537354","id":65207,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:29.775Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:29.775Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T02:49:45.072Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nPolymarket Prediction Market: Probability of \"#Bitcoin January Surge to $100,000\" Rises to 38%\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372537353","id":65208,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:30.075Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:30.075Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T02:49:45.070Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nTop Whale Watch: \"$BTC OG Insider Whale\" Turns Loss into Gain After Holding Position for 20 Days, \"ZEC Largest Short\" Recently Loses $11.6 Million\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372536065","id":65209,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:30.377Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:30.377Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T02:49:45.062Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\n#Solana-based Meme Coin WhiteWhale Surges Over 40% in the Past 24 Hours, Currently Trading at 0.067 $USDT\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372537352","id":65210,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:30.677Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:30.677Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T02:49:45.059Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\n「$BTC OG Insider Whale」 Long Position Turns from Loss to Profit, Currently Sitting on $1.33 Million Unrealized Gain\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372537350","id":65211,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:31.192Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:31.192Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T02:49:45.054Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nPolymarket's prediction market now gives a 38% probability to \"#Bitcoin hitting $100,000 in January\".\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372537349","id":65212,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:31.417Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:31.417Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T02:49:45.049Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nA Trader Profited $400,000 from Maduro's Arrest, US Lawmaker Plans to Legislate Against Prediction Market 'Insider Trading'\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372536064","id":65213,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:31.748Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:31.748Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T02:49:45.047Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nThree Key Events Shaping the 2026 Market\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372537348","id":65214,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:32.045Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:32.045Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T02:49:45.045Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nBSC On-Chain 'Rug Pull' Market Cap Rebounds to $40 Million, Now Trading at $0.039\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372537347","id":65215,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:32.345Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T02:53:32.345Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T03:19:02.037Z","text_content":"$BTC , #Bitcoin  spot ETFs saw a surge on Jan 2, 2026, posting $ 471.3M in net inflows in a single session, per ETF flow data.

It looks relatively straightforward, with the only caveat being somewhat low volume, though what volume exists is positive. Also, spot CVD is currently at its lows (meaning there are no significant spot purchases, and the price is being driven by futures positions). At the $94k and $93k levels, there are large sell orders, but above them sits liquidity with few other major sellers. So, if buyer pressure intensifies, we could absorb these two large sell walls to collect liquidity before a potential move down.  For now, we lack a Break of Structure (BOS) on higher timeframes, sufficient volume, and the stability of capital rotation (check the TOTAL charts on TradingView). We'll likely continue to chop around in this range.  I can't rule out that this is the calm before the storm, similar to April—no one believed the first pump, nor the second, but by the third, it was too late, hehe. Currently, there's insufficient data to construct a solid \"to the moon\" strategy; we need to watch developments in real-time.  In low-attention environments, price often drifts higher not on genuine demand, but on leverage accumulation. Such moves tend to look structurally “clean” — resembling healthy retests or continuation patterns — while in reality they serve as positioning traps. Participants entering late, especially via futures, often become the liquidity source for the next redistribution phase.  If someone is considering a position, it's also better to decide in the moment. Alternatively, you could consider placing sell limit orders at $93k, $94k, and $97k with a stop-loss based on your Risk Management (RM) and take-profit levels at $92k and $90k.

This strength is signaling a potential continuation to the upside, which is exactly what I have been waiting for over the past two months.\n\nAfter Bitcoin hit my sub 90k target, I clearly stated that a move toward the 1W 50 EMA in the 98k to 100k region, or even slightly above, was still possible before any major downside continuation.\n\nAt this stage, the market appears to be attempting that move. For this reason, I am placing multiple short orders at 98k and 100k.\n\nI am keeping my existing shorts from the 118k region fully open, while current short orders are only preparation if price moves higher.

Bitcoin Confirms Recovery and Targets New Peaks.\nHey Investor, here is the summary of what the current charts are telling us:\nThe Strongest Technical Recovery (EMA200): The most important signal is the reclaiming of the EMA200 level on the 4-hour timeframe (as indicated by the X analysis). This is not just an uptrend; it is a strong technical confirmation that major selling pressure has ended, and we have entered the \"relief rally\" phase.\nStability Above 90,000: The price chart clearly shows that Bitcoin has stabilized above the 90,000 level, trading at $91,096 with a 1.09\\% rise. This stability confirms that institutions likely viewed 90K as a \"new floor\" for purchasing.\nPositive Momentum: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 71.87, indicating strong momentum and an active buying wave. The moving averages (MA7, MA30, MA200) are also diverging positively.\n💡 The Investment Conclusion:\nBitcoin has officially transitioned from the \"Defense\" phase to the \"Offense\" phase. Reclaiming the EMA200 confirms the end of the deep correction. Now, focus on the resistance levels near 91,400.\nThe Verdict: The current movement is a \"confirmation\" that the major uptrend wave has begun!\n#BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?# #TechnicalAnalysis \n $BTC","gravity_id":"372540252","id":65485,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T08:30:05.876Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T08:40:06.393Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T08:27:08.980Z","text_content":"Crypto education is self-driven.

While the issue highlights the need for stronger consumer protection and education, it also puts $BTC  infrastructure under increasing regulatory scrutiny moving forward.  ﻿Join us on Telegram: t.me/AlphaCryptoSignal  ﻿#CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#  #CMC Smart Quests#  #Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372540765","id":65542,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T09:10:08.311Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T09:10:08.311Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T09:03:05.293Z","text_content":"$BTC 💰 Bitcoin recovers —Bottom confirmed\n\n#Bitcoin #BTC #BTCUSDT\n\nI was told, \"I will only accept Bitcoin as bullish when it trades above 90K.\" \nAgreed. Bitcoin is now trading above $90,000.\n\nThe bottom is in and we have a full bottom process.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was set to produce a higher high, the bottom process produced lower lows. As Bitcoin is now set to produce a lower high, the bottom process is printing higher lows. This is shown with the blue lines on the chart.\n\nIt is the fourth consecutive day of bullish action. As insignificant as this might sound, incredibly enough, Bitcoin hasn't close more than three days green since the November bottom—incredible. After three days, red again.\n\nSo after the correction low, and since late October, it is the first time Bitcoin trades green for four consecutive days. And this is huge... When it comes to this-our market and TA. This means we are set to experience a very nice bullish wave.\n\nWe mapped some targets, but these can be violated on the way up. The important part to keep in mind is that the move after the bullish wave is likely to end in a lower low. We will adapt and update if anything changes.\n\nAt $94,600 we have a new higher high, this would confirm a local uptrend for the first time since the correction, the correction lasted only 46 days. It is not that much and it ain't that bad. Up-up up, we are going up next.\n\nNamaste.","gravity_id":"372540758","id":65543,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T09:10:08.498Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T09:10:08.498Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T09:02:33.409Z","text_content":"Funding rates for Bitcoin have flipped negative, highlighting just how much disbelief is still present in the market. When funding turns negative, it means shorts are paying longs, signaling that traders are aggressively positioning for downside rather than upside. Historically, this setup often appears near inflection points. Heavy short bias can act as fuel if price stabilizes or moves higher, forcing shorts to cover. While it doesn’t guarantee an immediate reversal, $BTC  being shorted aggressively while holding structure is a condition that deserves close attention.

And they’re not stopping there, Bitmain is bundling the deal with hosting services across the US, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Paraguay, and Ethiopia, offering power rates between 5.5–7¢/kWh.

Whoever controlled money decided what mattered, what got funded, and what got ignored. But something fundamental is shifting in how influence forms, particularly in how civic and market signals get captured.   As a #SocialMining  contributor exploring @XPOLL_News  and the #XPoll  model, I want to examine why independence now gets earned through participation rather than granted by institutions.   Artificial intelligence has become exceptionally good at execution. AI scans more data, reacts faster, and executes millions of decisions in seconds. Trying to beat markets trade by trade, whether in $BTC  or traditional assets, is becoming impossible for everyone except machines. Speed and capital no longer determine who shapes outcomes.   What matters now sits upstream from execution, which is deciding what deserves to become a market in the first place. Before anything can be traded, it must first be noticed, measured, and understood. That process used to be controlled by institutions and media gatekeepers.   As #AI  takes over execution, real value shifts to meaning formation. Communities can now turn voices and lived experiences into visible signals through platforms that enable bottom-up participation. Instead of waiting for institutions to define relevance, people ask their own questions, measure real sentiment, and create signal representations of shared expectations.   In a world where algorithms handle execution, the most valuable thing becomes human signal with integrity. Independence gets earned by participation, by asking questions, by showing up early, and by contributing voice before decisions get made for you.   The future belongs to those who see change first, name it clearly, and share it openly. Independence is not declared but earned daily.","gravity_id":"372546136","id":65651,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T10:40:17.526Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T10:40:17.526Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T10:31:18.808Z","text_content":"$BTC  Bitcoin is the next..  precision study shows that a bull trend will start in 7 hours","gravity_id":"372546127","id":65652,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T10:40:17.765Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T10:40:17.765Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T10:30:12.076Z","text_content":"#Bitcoin  Momentum shift checklist   ✔️Tenkan reclaim 🔴  ✔️Kijun 🔵 ✔️Break the trendline ⏳Acceptance above the cloud  $BTC  is inside the cloud. $98.5k is the level that matters.   ﻿#Altcoin Season#  $ZEC  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372545129","id":65653,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T10:40:17.984Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T10:40:17.984Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T10:48:55.321Z","text_content":"$BTC sell 76,000$","gravity_id":"372545212","id":65667,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T10:50:05.436Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T10:50:05.436Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T10:48:53.434Z","text_content":"$BTC Buy","gravity_id":"372545210","id":65668,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T10:50:05.736Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T10:50:05.736Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T10:48:23.331Z","text_content":"🚨 JUST IN:  $BTC needs to drop $2000 to wipe out $1.1B in longs, but it only needs to go up $770 to wipe out $1.1B in shorts.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372543111","id":65669,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T10:50:06.059Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T10:50:06.059Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T10:45:48.127Z","text_content":"⚡🚨 LATEST 🚨\n🔶 The US Government now holds over $30B in crypto with 97% of it in  $BTC.\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372546185","id":65670,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T10:50:06.655Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T10:50:06.655Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T10:43:45.050Z","text_content":"Bitcoin faces a violent repricing Monday if this specific supply-chain metric proves the bond market right\n\nvia @andjelaradmilac \n\nhttps://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-faces-a-violent-repricing-monday-if-this-specific-supply-chain-metric-proves-the-bond-market-right/","gravity_id":"372545191","id":65671,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T10:50:06.869Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T10:50:06.869Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T10:41:46.476Z","text_content":"$BTC  The next bullrun can take BTC to 140K. with time we can follow step by step the trend.","gravity_id":"372543080","id":65672,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T10:50:07.094Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T10:50:07.094Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T10:41:20.574Z","text_content":"$BTC  🟠\r \r 180 Day Realized Price % Change. \r \r Look at previous tops. \r \r This whole cycle has barely got above the move we saw in 2019. \r \r Green spike loading.","gravity_id":"372542361","id":65673,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T10:50:07.422Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T10:50:07.422Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T10:40:33.714Z","text_content":"$BTC Bitcoin is soaring!

Multiple breakout attempts from this range failed, confirming the strength of the boundaries and the lack of sustained momentum during that phase. Eventually, price broke out of the range to the upside and transitioned into a clean ascending channel, signaling a short-term bullish shift. This move was supported by higher highs and higher lows, reflecting increasing buyer control. However, as price approached the major Resistance Zone around 91,800, bullish momentum started to fade. The market printed reactions and hesitation near this resistance, indicating strong selling interest at higher levels.\n\nCurrently, the upper boundary of the ascending channel is being tested, and price is currently struggling to hold above the 90,000 Support Zone, which previously acted as a key breakout and demand area. The recent price action suggests that the upside move is losing strength and may be corrective rather than impulsive.\n\nMy Scenario & Strategy\n\nMy primary scenario: as long as BTCUSDT remains below the 91,800 Resistance Zone and fails to reclaim the upper part of the ascending channel, the bias favors a short-term bearish correction. A rejection from resistance increases the probability of a pullback toward the 90,000 Support Zone, which is the first key downside target. If this support fails to hold, further downside continuation toward lower range levels becomes possible.\n\nHowever, a strong bullish breakout and acceptance above 91,800 would invalidate the short bias and open the door for renewed upside continuation within or above the channel. For now, price is at a critical decision area, with sellers defending resistance and buyers attempting to hold structure.","gravity_id":"372547209","id":65897,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T14:30:08.365Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T14:30:08.365Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T14:40:25.913Z","text_content":"Total Market Cap (Excluding $BTC  & Stables)  Coming to the end of a strong week for Alts.  2026 will be a movie.","gravity_id":"372548269","id":65917,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T14:40:40.987Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T14:50:07.231Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T14:37:45.045Z","text_content":"Sound money is important.\n\nUsable money is essential.\n\nBitcoin.ℏ was created to bring both together. 🧠⚖️\n\nThe Common Sense Bitcoin.\n🔗 https://bitcoin.org.ht ","gravity_id":"372548256","id":65918,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T14:40:41.294Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T14:50:07.541Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T14:37:45.037Z","text_content":"Still hearing “crypto is a scam” and “BTC to zero”?

This represents one of the most aggressive accumulation phases in the asset's history, occurring even as the price remains stuck in a volatile range between $87,000 and $90,000.  While institutional entities and \"Long-Term Holders\" (LTHs) are aggressively buying the dip, short-term traders remain sidelined. The Fear & Greed Index remains in \"Extreme Fear\" (23), reflecting retail exhaustion after the 2025 autumn correction. Historically, when whales accumulate in high volume while retail sentiment is bottomed out, it marks the precursor to a structural supply shock.

A short pullback to the breakout zone would be normal and healthy, but a return inside the range would weaken the bullish outlook.","gravity_id":"372550436","id":66134,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T17:40:07.012Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T17:40:07.012Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T17:34:44.187Z","text_content":"This is the most important range for $BTC  !  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372550435","id":66135,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T17:40:07.318Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T17:40:07.318Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T17:34:09.076Z","text_content":"Big support for $BTC  !🚨  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372550434","id":66136,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T17:40:07.621Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T17:40:07.621Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T17:33:44.452Z","text_content":"$BTC  looks undervalued compared to the Global Liquidity!  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372551277","id":66137,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T17:40:07.923Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T17:40:07.923Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T17:32:53.848Z","text_content":"This is the largest drawdown EVER for $BTC  ETFs.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372550429","id":66138,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T17:40:08.222Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T17:40:08.222Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T17:48:42.854Z","text_content":"⚡ UPDATE: Every time $ETH  has had a red Q4, the following Q1 has been green.
