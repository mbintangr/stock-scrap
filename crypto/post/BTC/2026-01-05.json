Historically, these liquidity boosts tend to ease financial conditions - and crypto usually feels it early.  Bitcoin has already started the year strong, briefly moving above $90K as the market tries to recover from last year’s October crash. While rate cuts aren’t expected immediately, Reserve Management Purchases are back on the table, and some analysts see this as the kind of setup that has fueled major BTC rallies in past cycles.  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372553741","id":66311,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T19:30:05.301Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T19:40:06.876Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T19:22:00.564Z","text_content":"$BTC  clearing $91K looks more than a short-term bounce.

But weekend highs are a higher quality magnet than CME Close.   On top, our bias is also overall bullish (see this post for instance).   Therefore, that simply and logically means:   Use the higher quality magnet (the weekend highs above) for a target, and the lower quality magnet for an wait-for-entry if given, especially if you followed along and are already long from lower (85.2 k), this is worth  missing out upon.  Shorting here, or before setting the weekend highs, as well as after, is suboptimal as you  are shorting below a magnet which is tough, can draw out, and keep on stopping you out multiple times with a magnet pull against you.   The only play I would make is indeed adding to longs (playing the trend) below the CME Close level if given.   Or wait for a move above weekend highs  before thinking about shorts with extra conditions fulfilled which we will see on Monday/Tuesday (both better RR and higher chance of it working out, win-win).   This idea should cut out 90% of the noise you see around.    Where many keep shorting to the CME gap (because it \"has to\" be filled), yet keep getting stopped. Maybe they are right  eventually, but they have been eating many SL's and eroding capital or mental capital beforehand so even if right, it's hard to call it a win even if the drop comes.   Play the bullish direction or the bearish  direction with aggressive TP's. As we have a bullish bias and also higher quality magnets above versus below.   It is this exact mentality (on higher  timeframes), that also made us long 85.2k and not trying to short every high created anymore once we moved below our 87k level which activated our trigger to look for longs  below if you remember, triggering one at 85.2k   #CryptoZeno  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372554124","id":66351,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T20:00:07.922Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T20:00:07.922Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T19:49:45.154Z","text_content":"BTC Live Price ","gravity_id":"372553885","id":66352,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T20:00:08.234Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T20:00:08.234Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T20:09:33.495Z","text_content":"$BTC passage of time will show everything and prove that RATWIF is the best memecoin and will grow the most in Bullrun.","gravity_id":"372554232","id":66357,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T20:10:06.032Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T20:10:06.032Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T20:06:13.967Z","text_content":"$BTC fj","gravity_id":"372553970","id":66358,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T20:10:06.335Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T20:10:06.335Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T20:06:11.573Z","text_content":"$BTC dk","gravity_id":"372553969","id":66359,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T20:10:06.645Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T20:10:06.645Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T20:06:07.391Z","text_content":"$BTC hd","gravity_id":"372553968","id":66360,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T20:10:06.979Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T20:10:06.979Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T20:05:13.372Z","text_content":"⚡ NEW: 50% of all recorded Q1 periods for $BTC   have shown positive performance.  💡 Follow me to get smart trading insights every day!","gravity_id":"372554208","id":66361,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T20:10:07.282Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T20:10:07.282Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T20:03:53.688Z","text_content":"📉LIQUIDITY CLUSTERS BUILDING BELOW  Liquidity clusters are forming around the $86K–$87K $BTC  level.","gravity_id":"372554201","id":66362,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T20:10:07.470Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T20:10:07.470Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-04T20:03:26.408Z","text_content":"Holding exchange tokens can be a powerful way to grow alongside an exchange’s ecosystem.

Supply shock incoming?   \n\nSources say it came from:  \n- Gold swaps (2018–2020): ~400k BTC bought at ~$5k avg  \n- Oil deals in USDT → swapped to BTC (2023–2025): $10–15B  \n- Seized mining ops: extra $500M\n\n#Bitcoin #BTC #Crypto #Venezuela #NicolasMaduro\nIf confirmed and seized by the US, this could represent ~3% of total Bitcoin supply entering government custody.

It is the result of sustained structural demand meeting a historically constrained supply profile.   From a market structure perspective, #BTC  continues to print higher lows on the daily timeframe after reclaiming the $88K–$89K range, which now acts as a well-defined demand zone. The recent pullbacks have been shallow and corrective, not impulsive, indicating distribution has not yet emerged. Price acceptance above $90K signals that this level is transitioning from resistance into value.  On the volume side, the +39% increase in 24h trading activity confirms participation, but importantly, volume is not accelerating at a rate that would suggest blow-off behavior. This is constructive. Healthy trends advance on moderate volume expansion. The Vol/Mkt Cap ratio at ~1.8% remains far below historical cycle peaks, reinforcing that this move is not overcrowded.  BTC’s supply dynamics remain the dominant driver. Over 19.97M BTC are already in circulation, with new issuance now structurally minimal. Long-term holder supply remains elevated, while exchange balances continue to trend lower over time, reducing available float during periods of demand expansion. This is the same supply compression setup that historically precedes sustained trend extensions.  On the macro layer, Bitcoin is increasingly trading as a liquidity-sensitive asset. Capital rotation into BTC is occurring even as broader markets digest policy uncertainty, reinforcing its role as a neutral, non-sovereign asset. What matters next:   – Holding above $90K on daily closes maintains bullish market structure – A clean acceptance above $93K–$94K opens the path toward price discovery – Loss of $88K would signal short-term cooling, not trend failure  Do you see this phase as late-cycle strength?  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#   #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372569296","id":67100,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T06:50:06.536Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T07:00:07.573Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T06:46:41.320Z","text_content":"$BTC  i sell all. bull trap is coming","gravity_id":"372568538","id":67101,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T06:50:06.855Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T06:50:06.855Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T06:45:26.785Z","text_content":"🚀 Bitcoin is back above 93,000 and the mood is shifting  As $BTC  pushes past a key resistance level, veteran trader James Wynn has turned bullish again, reopening a major long position.

Analysts note the $88,000 range emerged as strong support amid thin liquidity during the holiday season, while inflows into spot ETFs have shifted market sentiment from “panic” to “cautious optimism.” As of early Monday, Bitcoin traded above $92,000, with its 100-hour moving average holding a bullish structure.   ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372569827","id":67168,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T07:50:06.941Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T07:50:06.941Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T07:40:45.084Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\n\"On-chain PEPE Top Long\" Single-Coin Unrealized Gain of $2.05 Million\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372569817","id":67169,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T07:50:07.145Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T07:50:07.145Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T07:40:45.079Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nWhy Has Meme Coin Become the Darling of the Crypto Market?\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372570069","id":67170,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T07:50:07.503Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T07:50:07.503Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T07:40:45.076Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nIf #Bitcoin breaks $94,000, mainstream CEX cumulative short liquidation pressure will reach $465 million\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372569816","id":67171,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T07:50:07.814Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T07:50:07.814Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T07:40:45.072Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nA Whale on Polymarket Loses Over $2 Million in 35 Days\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372569815","id":67172,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T07:50:08.130Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T07:50:08.130Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T07:58:45.058Z","text_content":"Bitcoin energy myths DEBUNKED!\n\nAn ESG expert used data to bust 9 misconceptions about BTC mining's environmental impact.\n\nThis de-risked narrative supports mining stability & a neutral hashprice, easing regulatory concerns.\n\nOptimize hashpower with this insight.","gravity_id":"372571025","id":67177,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T08:00:06.018Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T08:10:08.081Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T07:58:03.805Z","text_content":"$BTC JUST FLASHED A FRESH GOLDEN CROSS\n\nBitcoin has just experienced its fifth \"Golden Cross,\" a technical signal historically followed by significant price rallies, even though market sentiment currently remains low and skeptical.\n\nPrevious Golden Crosses were followed by strong price advances of 87%, 47%, 78%, and 33%. \n\nHistorically, these crossover signals appeared early in cycles during times of hesitation and doubt, BEFORE widespread optimism returned .\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Gold #Macro Insights# #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372571014","id":67178,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T08:00:06.211Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T08:10:08.389Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T07:57:51.376Z","text_content":"🚨 Crypto markets are on edge amid rising geopolitical tensions.

What stands out is how calm the reaction has been compared to earlier geopolitical events that often led to sharp risk-off behavior.\n\n\nAccording to several analysts, the main difference this time appears to be speed and execution. The Venezuela operation played out quickly, which reduced lingering uncertainty. With less time for fear to build, markets avoided panic pricing, allowing Bitcoin to stick with its technical recovery instead of losing structure.\n\n\nTrump’s broader rhetoric does introduce additional macro uncertainty. Comments involving Colombia, warnings aimed at Mexico, and renewed remarks about Greenland keep geopolitical risk in the background, even if it hasn’t become disruptive. Historically, these kinds of conditions can be supportive for Bitcoin as a non-sovereign asset, especially when volatility stays contained rather than spiking.\n\n\nFrom a market-structure angle, # $BTC holding above the $90K psychological level is worth noting. As long as price stays supported above that area, geopolitical headlines may function less as fear catalysts and more as background factors reinforcing Bitcoin’s macro sensitivity.\n\n\nFor now, the takeaway is simple:\nBitcoin isn’t reacting emotionally — it’s taking in geopolitical pressure while still showing upside momentum.\n#BTC #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"372571871","id":67274,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T09:10:07.423Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T09:10:07.423Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T09:04:45.045Z","text_content":"When Trump finds out Venezuela is holding $60B in Bitcoin \"Shadow Reserve\"\n\nHow much is Colombia and Cuba holding?

The reason? A classic power struggle between the FSC and the Bank of Korea over who gets to control the stablecoin and $BTC  market.  This delay is a double-edged sword. While it creates a \"regulatory gray zone\" for another year, the draft itself is incredibly aggressive. Introducing no-fault liability (operators pay for losses even if not at fault) and 100%+ reserve backing shows that Korea is prioritizing investor safety over market speed.  The real story here is the push for a Won-backed stablecoin. Korea is tired of USD dominance and wants its own on-chain currency to lead Asia. By 2026, we’ll see if they choose a \"Bank-led\" or \"Fintech-friendly\" path.

After several years of declining developer participation, contributor activity turned higher, a signal often overlooked during price-driven cycles.  According to contributor data, 135 developers contributed to Bitcoin Core in 2025, up from roughly 112 in 2024. While still below the ~200-contributor peak seen in 2018, this marks one of the strongest year-over-year rebounds in recent years.  This reversal matters. Historically, periods of renewed relevance for $BTC  tend to coincide with higher protocol-level engagement, and 2025 followed that pattern as institutional attention and infrastructure interest returned to the network.  🔧 Code Activity Moves Higher  Contributor growth translated into tangible output. In total, ~285,000 lines of code were changed in 2025, compared with ~276,000 in 2024 - a +3% YoY increase.  For a mature and conservative codebase like Bitcoin Core, even small increases are meaningful. Most changes focus on performance optimization, security hardening, and long-term maintainability, rather than headline features.  🛡️ Security and Funding Signals  In 2025, Bitcoin Core completed its first public third-party security audit, which reported no critical or high-risk vulnerabilities. This reinforced confidence in the protocol’s stability at a time when $BTC  is under growing global scrutiny.  Despite ongoing funding challenges typical of public-good software, development remains supported by a mix of grants, sponsors, and independent contributors - keeping the project resilient.  📌 Why It Matters  The combination of rising contributors, increased code output, and a clean audit suggests Bitcoin Core entered 2026 with renewed long-term commitment.  This isn’t about speculation. It’s about maintaining the foundation that secures the world’s most valuable decentralized network - quietly, methodically, and without shortcuts. #BTC Price Analysis#  #BTC100K","gravity_id":"372573436","id":67351,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T10:00:08.476Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T10:00:08.476Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T09:52:15.042Z","text_content":"Something is clearly broken in the crypto market, $BTC   should have surged on this news.   #BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372572682","id":67352,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T10:00:08.788Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T10:00:08.788Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T09:52:14.796Z","text_content":"$BTC The 2026 setup looking very solid.

Importantly, Lee framed the move not as dilution, but as strategic flexibility for future capital raises, M&A activity, and potential stock splits if prices become inaccessible for retail investors.   Why this matters:   • BMNR has effectively evolved into an ETH-centric treasury vehicle, with its stock closely tracking Ethereum  • Lee openly argues that if BTC$BTC  moves toward $1M, ETH could reprice  sharply - making stock splits a necessity rather than a choice  • The structure positions BMNR less like a traditional miner and more like a public ETH exposure proxy   The market reaction suggests investors understood the message:  capital structure is being prepared ahead of  the next cycle, not after it starts.  #BitMine  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372577039","id":67364,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T10:10:06.973Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T10:10:06.973Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T10:08:56.483Z","text_content":"Hey $BTC  fans! 🚀 Which gadget from WhiteBIT’s Crypto Santa would you love to win? 🎅 Vote and win 💎 prize pool!  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372576047","id":67365,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T10:10:07.283Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T10:10:07.283Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T10:08:11.401Z","text_content":"Whales continue loading #Bitcoin , first time in history that the BTC$BTC  accumulation is growing this exponentially. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372576040","id":67366,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T10:10:07.595Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T10:10:07.595Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T10:02:05.676Z","text_content":"I just scrolled through the feed everyone’s waiting for 98k, 102k, 108k, or at the very least 144k on  $BTC.\n\nKind of hilarious 😁\n\n#BTC Price Analysis#\n\n#Crypto\n\n#Binance","gravity_id":"372573526","id":67367,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T10:10:08.222Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T10:10:08.222Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T10:01:45.036Z","text_content":"GM ☕️\nJust 5 days into the year.\n\nWhat is your Bitcoin prediction for 2026? 👀","gravity_id":"372573516","id":67368,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T10:10:08.433Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T10:10:08.433Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T10:19:29.325Z","text_content":"$BTC  currently has two open CME gaps:\n\n-$91K–$90K \n-$88K\n\nMost CME gaps get filled within a week.A pullback is normal.

Across all major cohorts, long-term capital is steadily absorbing supply, reinforcing the broader bullish market structure.\r \r \r Accumulating addresses (blue) have reached new all-time highs in #Bitcoin  balance, accelerating notably throughout 2024–2025. This behavior is historically consistent with phases where long-term conviction outweighs short-term price fluctuations, often acting as a stabilizing force during periods of elevated volatility. Importantly, this accumulation has persisted even as price retraced from local highs, suggesting reduced sensitivity to short-term drawdowns.\r \r \r Retail accumulating addresses (orange) are also trending higher, though at a more measured pace. This indicates growing participation from smaller holders without the signs of euphoric inflows typically observed near cycle tops. Meanwhile, accumulating pattern addresses (green) continue their steady expansion.\r \r \r From a macro on-chain perspective, the MVRV ratio has cooled from overheated levels while remaining well above long-term mean values. Historically, such resets within an uptrend tend to extend cycle longevity rather than signal structural tops. This normalization suggests the market is digesting gains rather than distributing aggressively.\r \r \r Taken together, the divergence between rising accumulation balances and short-term price weakness points to a market still driven by conviction rather than speculation. As long as accumulation cohorts continue to absorb supply at this pace, downside risk appears structurally limited, with the broader trend remaining constructive for BTC in the medium to long term.\r \r #CryptoZeno  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372579162","id":67752,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T13:20:07.439Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T13:20:07.439Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T13:17:09.516Z","text_content":"📉 Institutional Yield: The Force Behind Bitcoin’s 2025 Calm\r \r \r Bitcoin is ending 2025 in a surprisingly \"quiet\" mood.

Instead of panic selling, geopolitical headlines have had a limited impact on market structure, with volatility staying relatively contained.\n\n🔴This resilience reinforces the view that Bitcoin is increasingly behaving like a macro asset, driven more by global liquidity, monetary expectations, and capital flows than by isolated geopolitical events.

December’s inflation data lands January 13, right before the next Fed meeting. It’s the first major economic signal of the year, and it could shake up Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market.  Last time, CPI surprised everyone by coming in lower than expected. Headline inflation dropped to 2.7%, core CPI hit 2.6%—the lowest since early 2021. People started hoping inflation was cooling off and maybe the Fed could stay more flexible. But then John Williams from the New York Fed pointed out that the numbers might’ve been skewed by the government shutdown. That’s why this next report matters so much.  Traders aren’t just sitting around. Prediction markets show about a 91% chance the Fed keeps rates steady this month, and barely anyone expects a cut. So, no one’s getting carried away. This CPI report could either back that cautious mood or flip the script fast.  CPI days are rarely boring for Bitcoin. If inflation comes in lower than expected, it strengthens the case for rate cuts later in the year and could keep Bitcoin’s rally going. BTC already jumped past $90,000 to kick off 2024—up about 6% so far—and a friendly inflation number could keep that momentum rolling.  But the risk cuts both ways. If CPI runs hot, risk assets like Bitcoin usually take a hit, at least in the short term. That doesn’t mean the big picture changes, but you might see a sharp drop as traders rethink rate cut bets.  Bottom line? Bitcoin’s acting like a macro asset again. Next week’s CPI isn’t just another stat—it’s a reset button for sentiment. Expect some fireworks, and pay attention to how Bitcoin settles after the dust clears.","gravity_id":"372584569","id":68173,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T16:40:05.722Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T16:40:05.722Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T16:39:29.241Z","text_content":"I’m bearish on $BTC","gravity_id":"372585311","id":68174,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T16:40:06.046Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T16:40:06.046Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T16:39:21.894Z","text_content":"🚨 BREAKING BRONDOR - THE #FED  JUST SURRENDERED  JEROME #POWELL  JUST GAVE EVERY BANK IN AMERICA THE \"GO\" SIGNAL FOR BITCOIN AND CRYPTO  They're coming for your bags.

The key signal is participation: 24h volume surged above $43B (+59%), lifting the volume-to-market-cap ratio to ~2.3%, a level typically seen when both spot buyers and derivatives desks are active.  From a market-structure perspective, BTC has held higher lows throughout the session and reclaimed prior intraday resistance without sharp rejection, suggesting controlled accumulation. With circulating supply at ~19.97M BTC and issuance structurally constrained, marginal demand continues to have an outsized impact on price when liquidity expands.  On the macro side, Bitcoin’s $1.87T market cap now places it firmly back into the “macro asset” conversation, where flows are influenced by risk appetite, balance-sheet allocation, and long-term hedging behavior. The absence of supply-side shocks, combined with rising turnover, points to a market that is being repriced higher through participation.  In short, today’s move reflects improving market depth and renewed capital engagement. If volume sustains while volatility remains contained, Bitcoin’s current price action reads as continuation-driven; an important distinction that the market will continue to test in the sessions ahead. #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#   #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372583953","id":68214,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T17:00:05.508Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T17:00:05.508Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T16:59:38.770Z","text_content":"$BTC  devs just cranked up activity 60%—the real builders are moving, not the TikTok shillers.
