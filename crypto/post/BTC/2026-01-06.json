Do not be fooled though, this didn't happen overnight. Bitcoin has been building up strength—a recovery process—since late November 2025.\n\nThe action to end last year was mixed but bullish nonetheless. Now that we are back at $94,000 and rising, we know as a matter of fact that the bullish bias is confirmed. We can expect higher prices.\n\nThe relief rally has been confirmed based on Bitcoin's price action. This fully reveals that we are headed higher in the coming weeks. All the altcoins are also recovering and moving forward for a while now.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, $240M worth of SHORT positions have been liquidated, vs only $12.5M worth of LONGs. This clearly reveals an overwhelming bearish bias and sentiment on Bitcoin and the Cryptocurrency market. \n\nWhat happens when the sentiment changes from bearish to bullish? What happens when the market realizes that we are headed up? \n\nI'll tell you, a massive bullish run.\n\nThe next rise is set to challenge the $98,000 to $104,000 price range. You can see the targets by visiting this trade. This trade is now at 216% profits within just 18 days and is set to continue growing.\n\nTrue and strong bullish momentum will develop when you see $1B worth of SHORT positions liquidated in a single day. When this happens, the entire market will produce a major advance, several levels up.\n\nThe fact that we are rising now, does not mean that there will be a retrace, absolutely not. The rise now confirms the bulls are in, things will only get better.\n\n\nJanuary 2026 is green —100% certain.\n\nThanks a lot for your continued support.\n\nNamaste.","gravity_id":"372593777","id":68966,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T23:10:07.218Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T23:20:08.456Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T23:02:21.732Z","text_content":"$BTC  The last OCTO fake bulltrend what looks like this one did started at 113K to 116k and it did crash away below 81K as end result","gravity_id":"372593754","id":68967,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T23:10:07.565Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T23:10:07.565Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-05T23:02:03.607Z","text_content":"$BTC  - Mcap 1.87T$ - 81%/ 5.9M votes Bullish  SC02 M5 - pending Long order.

That rising structure has now carried price straight back into the 92–94k zone – the same level where the last breakdown started. This makes the current region the first real higher-timeframe test of strength. If BTC can accept above this 92–94k block and use it as support on a pullback, the market will have turned a former breakdown level into a base for a larger recovery. If, instead, price gets rejected here and later loses the rising trendline, the move will fade back into a simple lower-high rally inside the broader downtrend. The message from the chart is clear: the trendline has done its job lifting price; now the 92–94k zone will decide whether this is a true reversal or just a relief bounce.  BTC has risen off the 80k low in a series of higher lows and is now hitting the 92–94k daily breakdown zone. Flip this level into support and the reversal is real; reject here and it risks turning back into a lower-high rally inside the larger downtrend.","gravity_id":"372599557","id":69228,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T03:10:06.124Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T03:30:08.363Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-06T03:07:26.934Z","text_content":"$BTC  has wicked passed the resistance at 94K, can it trade above it?  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372599543","id":69229,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T03:10:06.459Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T03:20:08.415Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-06T03:06:23.999Z","text_content":"$BTC  BTC is near the target of confirmed breakdown","gravity_id":"372598767","id":69230,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T03:10:06.813Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T03:20:08.738Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-06T03:00:00.166Z","text_content":"JUST IN: Michael Saylor Has Shared his First 2026 Strategy Tracker.\r \r \r “Orange or Green?” More #Bitcoin  ?\r \r \r Currently Holding: 672,497 $BTC  (~$61.31B)\r \r Average Entry: $74,997 per BTC\r \r \r Another BTC Buy May be Coming Tomorrow.","gravity_id":"372598723","id":69231,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T03:10:07.147Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T03:10:07.147Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-06T03:20:00.478Z","text_content":"$BTC Look for 106K to be the high for this run… then the games down again","gravity_id":"372599618","id":69235,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T03:20:06.622Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T03:30:06.899Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-06T03:19:15.926Z","text_content":"$BTC Yes We are mooning btc will chase above 3trillion market cap 📈\nWe made profit +74k$ in 3days in #BTC 💥","gravity_id":"372598848","id":69236,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T03:20:06.955Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T03:30:07.232Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-06T03:18:06.815Z","text_content":"$BTC \r Experts predict six RWA shifts for 2026: pilots become repeatable, standardized on‑chain financial products; legal wrappers and custody standards mature; institutions and regulated rails scale tokenized treasuries and credit; oracles, insurance and compliance tooling improve; DeFi composability rises.

The 30-day cumulative net position change shows STHs leaning toward distribution during periods of elevated price levels, while LTHs continue to absorb supply during pullbacks and consolidation phases. Historically, spikes in STH net outflows tend to align with short-term overheating, when momentum-driven participants take profit into strength. This behavior is once again visible as short-term cohorts reduce exposure after sharp advances, introducing near-term volatility but at the same time easing speculative excess in the market structure.   In contrast, the 30-day net position change of LTHs tells a structurally constructive story. Episodes of heavy selling pressure from STHs are being met with persistent accumulation from longer-term investors, a pattern that has repeatedly characterized   mid-cycle consolidations rather than macro tops. When BTC trades sideways after strong rallies and long-term holders continue to build positions, it usually reflects growing conviction in higher time-frame valuation and signals that supply is migrating from weaker hands to stronger ones.  Distribution by short-term participants creates the liquidity needed for long-term capital to scale in, while sustained LTH accumulation helps stabilize the market after explosive moves. As long as long-term holders do not shift into prolonged net distribution, the dominant trend remains intact, even if short-term price action stays choppy. In this context, the current divergence between short-term selling and long-term accumulation points less to a cycle peak and more to a continuation phase, keeping the medium-term outlook for BTC constructively biased despite inevitable volatility along the way.  #CryptoZeno  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372606939","id":69740,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T10:00:16.806Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T10:00:16.806Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-06T09:54:34.842Z","text_content":"Crypto Market Cap Watch: A Key Level Ahead\nIn 2026, over $250B has been added to the total crypto market cap, with the majority of inflows concentrated in $BTC and $ETH.\n\n\nIf the market can break and hold above $3.5T before the end of January, historical patterns suggest a strong expansion phase for altcoins could follow.\n\n\nAll eyes are on this level.\n\n\n#BTC #ETH #AltcoinSeason","gravity_id":"372607699","id":69741,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T10:00:17.011Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T10:00:17.011Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-06T09:54:33.539Z","text_content":"$BTC CNBC reports that the U.S. government may consider seizing Venezuela’s Bitcoin and other crypto holdings.\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372607698","id":69742,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T10:00:17.211Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T10:00:17.211Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-06T09:54:32.749Z","text_content":"$BTC\nAs we can see, resistance until proven otherwise.\nThis doesn’t change my plan.

California has officially brought crypto under its Unclaimed Property Law with the passage of AB 1052. The rule is simple: 3 years of inactivity = asset considered abandoned.  This isn’t a forced liquidation model. Unlike other states, California must keep crypto in its native form, appointing a licensed custodian instead of selling coins into USD. That’s a key distinction - value is preserved, not crystallized at the moment of seizure.  Why this matters:  Crypto is now legally classified as intangible property  Long-term “set it and forget it” custody is no longer neutral  Exchanges must implement notification systems before the 3-year clock expires  Self-custody quietly becomes the default for true HODL strategies  States like Illinois, Delaware, and Arizona already claim dormant crypto - but they liquidate first. California’s approach is more asset-protective, yet still forces action.  The timing is notable. This law arrives as $BTC  trades back above $90K, with broader market confidence rebuilding into 2026. Regulation here isn’t about banning crypto - it’s about forcing accountability in custody.  Bottom line: AB 1052 doesn’t kill HODL. It kills passive custody. For long-term investors, inactivity now carries regulatory risk. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372609601","id":69855,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T12:33:00.287Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T12:33:00.287Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-06T12:37:48.094Z","text_content":"INSTITUTIONAL ADOPTION\n\n\nMorgan Stanley has filed an S-1 registration with the SEC for a $BTC Trust, marking another major step in expanding regulated institutional access to Bitcoin.","gravity_id":"372611956","id":69901,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T12:40:05.845Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T12:40:05.845Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-06T12:37:45.066Z","text_content":"Alts or BTC — pick one.\nWho leads the next bull run in early 2026?

BANK OF AMERICA SHIFTS COURSE AND OPENS CRYPTO ENTRY UP TO 4% IN BITCOIN\n\n🔴Bank of America has reportedly updated its stance on Bitcoin and crypto exposure, indicating that it may now allow allocations up to 4% of client portfolios in Bitcoin and potentially other digital assets. This represents a significant shift from more cautious positions previously held by many large U.S. banks.\n\n🔴The move signals growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate portfolio component rather than a fringe or speculative holding. Allowing meaningful exposure — even at 4% — reflects broader trends of traditional financial institutions integrating crypto into asset allocation frameworks, particularly as demand for digital alternatives to cash and bonds increases.\n\n🔴Analysts see this as part of a wider evolution in conservative money management, where regulated banks and wealth managers begin to incorporate Bitcoin as a hedge and diversifier alongside traditional asset classes.\n\n🔴The decision may influence other major institutions, weighing how to position clients in a market where macro conditions and long-term adoption narratives continue to evolve.","gravity_id":"372613653","id":70066,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T14:20:05.544Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T14:20:05.544Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-06T14:16:45.066Z","text_content":"🚨 U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LIQUIDATES $6.3M IN BITCOIN DESPITE PRESIDENTIAL ORDER\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has reportedly sold $6.3 million worth of Bitcoin from its holdings, even though a recent presidential order encouraged government agencies to consider digital assets as strategic reserves rather than dispose of them.\n\nThe liquidation highlights a possible tension between executive guidance on digital asset strategy and the Justice Department’s operational decisions regarding seized crypto assets.

Once I started confirming my BTC, ETH, SOL, BGB, and XRP setups with GetAgent, my trades became more structured and calmer.  Now I combine my own TA with GetAgent before entering any trade. It doesn’t guarantee wins, but it helps me avoid bad decisions which has made a big difference in my consistency.
