While nothing guarantees a move to $100k, taking out forced selling pressure and increased institutional interest have historically aligned with sustained bull runs, so the environment looks technically and sentimentally healthier for upside continuation.","gravity_id":"372654185","id":72563,"createdAt":"2026-01-07T18:50:07.110Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-07T18:50:07.110Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-07T18:46:45.085Z","text_content":"🤵‍♂ I’ve been saying buy Bitcoin on my YouTube channel since it was around $18K.\n\nConviction beats noise. 📈₿ ","gravity_id":"372654175","id":72564,"createdAt":"2026-01-07T18:50:07.491Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-07T18:50:07.491Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-07T18:46:45.080Z","text_content":"NEW: 📲 #Bitcoin social mentions hit a monthly high on Jan 6th, with over 220K posts on X in a single day.\n\nThe platform saw 1.1M Bitcoin posts in the first week of 2026 alone. 📈 ","gravity_id":"372657131","id":72565,"createdAt":"2026-01-07T18:50:07.861Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-07T18:50:07.861Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-07T18:46:45.076Z","text_content":"Venezuela is rumored to have $60 billion in bitcoin.\n\nWhat does this mean for bitcoin and Venezuelans?

Price isn’t collapsing, but it’s not breaking out either - it’s stuck in a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers.  Analyst Keith Alan says a move back toward $87,500 is likely at some point. Right now, bulls are trying to hold support near $92,000, but the order book suggests bigger players are fine letting price dip first and “check” that level.  The logic is simple. Before $BTC  can really run again, the market may need one more cleanup. A proper support test, some weak hands shaken out - and only then a daily Golden Cross could kick off the next rally.  When you zoom out, the message stays cautious. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are sitting at key decision points, and new all-time highs may be more of a 2027 story than a 2026 one.

Sometimes the best trade is simply reassessing risk. ﻿$BREV  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372659989","id":72965,"createdAt":"2026-01-07T23:30:08.123Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-07T23:30:08.123Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-07T23:39:18.246Z","text_content":"Breaking News: BlackRock’s head of equity ETFs says on CNBC that the growth story for Bitcoin $BTC  and Ethereum is still just beginning.  #BTC  #ETH  #Bitcoin  #Ethereum  #Crypto","gravity_id":"372662136","id":72970,"createdAt":"2026-01-07T23:40:05.216Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-07T23:40:05.216Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-07T23:39:05.672Z","text_content":"$BTC  Call Me Crazy Mr Crypto Jesuds but I say BTC Boumces this solid DEMAND here look at the PRICE ACTION JESUS!","gravity_id":"372662134","id":72971,"createdAt":"2026-01-07T23:40:05.468Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-07T23:40:05.468Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-07T23:39:01.054Z","text_content":"Breaking News: S&P 500 futures have reached the 7,000 level for the first time in history.  #Markets  #SP500  #USA  $BTC","gravity_id":"372662132","id":72972,"createdAt":"2026-01-07T23:40:05.827Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-07T23:40:05.827Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-07T23:38:58.068Z","text_content":"🚨 BREAKING\n\nTHE EXACT REASON WHY #BITCOIN JUST CRASHED:\n\nBINANCE SOLD 9,635 BTC\nCOINBASE SOLD 6,766 BTC\nPAXOS SOLD 6,757 BTC\nGALAXY DIGITAL SOLD 4,050 BTC\nWINTERMUTE SOLD 2,808 BTC\n\nTHEY DUMPED $3.55 BILLION  $BTC IN 45 MINUTES.\n\nTHIS WAS A COORDINATED MANIPULATION!!\n\n#altoinseason","gravity_id":"372663125","id":72973,"createdAt":"2026-01-07T23:40:06.191Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-07T23:40:06.191Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-07T23:37:19.294Z","text_content":"$BTC  Finally confirmation Bullrun possiblity is not confirmed, BTC enters into bearmarket, it can take possible 70 days+ before we get new cycle chance. we will follow the confirmed breakdown until the max","gravity_id":"372663110","id":72974,"createdAt":"2026-01-07T23:40:06.571Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-07T23:40:06.571Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-07T23:36:00.008Z","text_content":"$BTC \r MSCI on Jan. 6 spared a popular \"Bitcoin Treasury\" strategy from index expulsion, averting a potential forced sell-off in crypto-linked equities.

What I personally enjoy most:   ✔ Lower fees, makes frequent trading feel a lot less painful ✔ Higher leverage, better capital efficiency without overcomplicating things ✔ Strong liquidity, smoother execution and less slippage, even during volatile moments  The TradFi + crypto combo actually works.

Leverage above 500x is rarely used by serious traders and mainly increases liquidation risk. That’s why Bitget’s 500x leverage stands out as a more responsible and practical choice for everyday trading.  What really sets Bitget TradFi apart, however, is how seamlessly it blends crypto and traditional markets. With one account for multiple assets, you can trade everything from $BTC  to tokenized stocks like $AMZNon  without jumping between platforms. Using USDT as margin keeps capital management simple and efficient, while the transparent fee structure and competitive Bitget TradFi spreads ensure you always know your true trading costs, no hidden surprises.  In short, Bitget TradFi isn’t about flashy numbers; it’s about smart leverage, streamlined access to diverse assets, and fair, transparent pricing designed for traders who actually play the long game. ﻿#Macro Insights#  #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"372662753","id":73056,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T01:00:06.699Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T01:00:06.699Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T00:57:24.645Z","text_content":"$BTC now has less selling pressure after MSCI removed about $15B in forced selling.\n\n\nThis gives the market more room to move and helps confidence slowly return.\n\n\nNot a guarantee of a pump but a healthier setup for the next move.\n\n\nWatching how this plays out on BingX and across the market.\n\n\n#BTC #BingX #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"372662752","id":73057,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T01:00:07.079Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T01:00:07.079Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T00:56:36.884Z","text_content":"$BTC is cooling into structure — not collapsing.\n• Resistance: recent highs (supply still present)\n• Support: prior demand zone (buyers defending)\nUntil one side breaks with acceptance, this is range behavior.\nLet price choose — risk stays defined.","gravity_id":"372662746","id":73058,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T01:00:07.444Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T01:00:07.444Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T00:55:10.537Z","text_content":"It's really encouraging to see the MSCI finally acknowledge that balance sheet composition shouldn't arbitrarily disqualify healthy operating companies.  \r \r Taking that $15B \"forced selling\" overhang off the table is a massive relief for the mid-term structure, as it prevents a mechanical dump from passive funds that would have devastated liquidity.

I have been talking about BTC price developing dynamically between these specific Timescape Levels exactly as it’s happening, for weeks.

He improved consistency by shifting his focus to capital protection, reducing position sizes, avoiding low liquidity periods, and improving execution with tighter spreads by using bitget tradfi. These changes mattered even more as $BTC  remains in a volatile, range bound phase in the crypto market, where uncertainty often spills over into broader risk assets.

MSCI has decided not to exclude digital asset treasury companies (DATCOs) from its global equity indexes for now, shelving earlier plans that could have forced as much as $10B–$15B in forced selling from passive funds tracking crypto-heavy firms.  This move removes a major near-term overhang for Bitcoin-linked equities such as Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and eases mechanical selling pressure tied to index rebalancing. Shares of DATCOs jumped after the news, signaling reduced stress in crypto-treasury exposure channels.  However, MSCI will conduct a broader review of how firms holding significant digital assets are classified, leaving longer-term structural questions open.  📈 With this forced selling risk diminished, some analysts see tailwinds for Bitcoin price sentiment. But moving BTC toward $100,000 still depends on broader institutional inflows, demand dynamics, macro conditions, and regulatory clarity not just index technicals.

The main liquidity magnets remain above — in the $95,000 area. At the moment, the market continues to trade within the VAH of the 6-week composite, while the 4H order flow remains intact, keeping the relevance of trading from the nearest balances inside the 4H FVG.\r \r The $94,000 level acts as a key resistance and preserves the composite structure. The current market structure forms two base scenarios:\r — price holds above the composite, forming a new local balance, with sell-side absorption and acceptance of higher prices;\r — a return back into balance with continuation of the correction toward the lower VA boundaries, targeting the $87,000 area.\r \r 📊 Metrics\r \r Bid/Ask Ratio on local depths shows overheating on the bid side — there is no full imbalance yet, but values are approaching peak levels. On larger depths, support from a large player remains, pulling bid liquidity higher.\r \r The key reaction zone is the POC around $90,000 & the 4H FVG at $89,500. No notable reactive activity is observed near the VAH so far.\r According to heatmaps, the nearest long-term liquidity is concentrated around $87,000.\r \r 💬 Conclusion\r \r The next scenario will be determined as price approaches $90,000. With active sell-side absorption, an expansion toward $95,000 is possible. If buyer strength weakens, price is likely to remain within the composite VA, with a logical continuation of the correction toward $87,000.  \r #Bitcoin  #TechnicalAnalysis  #OrderFlow  #Liquidity  #PriceAction","gravity_id":"372670397","id":73461,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T07:30:09.721Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T07:30:09.721Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T07:38:33.259Z","text_content":"$BTC  The market IS FULL OF CONFIDENCE.

We are talking about MNTC, the world's second decentralized crypto coin after Bitcoin, which has been in the market for the past 3 years. On December 11, 2025, it became the world's second decentralized crypto coin after Bitcoin, which you can view live anytime and anywhere on the world's number one blockchain, Binance. Decentralized means that it no longer has any owner, and not a single coin can be minted (created) from its supply. The smart contract on which it was built means that its supply of 78 million coins is now fixed and cannot be changed in the future.  No one can hack it because the owner's address in the smart contract has been set to Null, which you can verify on the Binance blockchain. The company that created MNTC decided to make it decentralized because currently, millions of crypto coins are circulating in the world, and thMNTC, which is exactly like Bitcoin, but most people in India and the world are still unaware of it. This is why, despite having a supply one-third that of Bitcoin (78 million), its price is so low. Currently, only the company and a few people who joined earlier know about it. Now that it has become decentralized, only a few people are aware of its decentralized nature; others still consider it like any other coin.  They're thinking, \"We just have this coin, and if the price increases a bit, we'll sell.\" But the reality is, they don't yet understand its decentralized nature. If you ask a real crypto expert, they'll say it will be more expensive than gold. And the day crypto experts and investors learn about it, they will hoard the entire supply because they're getting MNTC at such a low price right now. This is because, in reality, the world and crypto experts don't know about it yet. The day the world finds out, MNTC could reach $50, $100, $500, $1000, $5000, $50000, or even more...

Passive funds no longer face mechanical selling of crypto-linked equities, which helps liquidity, sentiment, and overall risk appetite across markets tied to Bitcoin. That said, this decision removes downside risk rather than creating new demand. It stabilizes the environment but doesn’t directly drive BTC buying. For Bitcoin to reach $100,000, this relief needs to align with stronger catalysts like sustained ETF inflows, favorable macro conditions, and continued institutional adoption. Bottom line: MSCI’s move clears a key obstacle and supports a bullish setup, but $100,000 still requires follow-through from demand — not just the absence of forced selling. #BTC  #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"372673029","id":73588,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T08:40:09.731Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T08:40:09.731Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T08:49:43.098Z","text_content":"I'm bearish on $BTC","gravity_id":"372673273","id":73594,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T08:50:06.097Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T08:50:06.097Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T08:49:17.582Z","text_content":"$BTC  Fed adds $40 billion!!!!\r \r \r Hayes’ argument that Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by March hinges on the Fed’s plan to buy $40 billion of government debt each month.\r \r \r This, he argued, essentially amounts to the central bank printing new money.\r \r \r Once investors realise that this pretty much amounts to quantitative easing, then Hayes said it’s only a matter of time before Bitcoin’s price skyrockets..","gravity_id":"372672260","id":73595,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T08:50:06.480Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T08:50:06.480Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T08:49:05.462Z","text_content":"🚨 BITCOIN $BTC JUST DUMPED BELOW $90,000\n\n\n$100 MILLION IN CRYPTO WAS LIQUIDATED ON THIS MOVE\n\n\nWHO IS SELLING? 👀","gravity_id":"372672258","id":73596,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T08:50:06.832Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T08:50:06.832Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T08:48:56.283Z","text_content":"$BTC  Attack at greenland by trump means END NATO","gravity_id":"372673252","id":73597,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T08:50:07.192Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T08:50:07.192Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T08:48:23.497Z","text_content":"$BTC  BREAKING NEWS: TRUMP leave 31 Nations (UN.. what is the plan, will he attack greenland","gravity_id":"372672239","id":73598,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T08:50:07.544Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T08:50:07.544Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T08:48:20.176Z","text_content":"👀 Is the $BTC  market entering a growth phase?

The market is in a suspended state — direction has not been chosen, yet tension continues to build. In such conditions, the most vulnerable participants are: 1. Those who built positions within the range or slightly above it — their expectations remain unrealized. 2. Those who struggle with waiting and are tempted to enter without an edge, simply to “be in the market.” At its core, the market is not testing levels — it is testing time. How long participants are willing to hold positions without movement or confirmation. Notably, neither news flow nor ETF inflows have resulted in a sustained impulse. This suggests the market is actively avoiding directional commitment and is unwilling to confirm either side. A move to the downside within this structure is largely anticipated. What remains unclear is not the move itself, but the function it serves. In that case, an upward move would emerge not from strength, but from the absence of resistance. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Market Psychology#  #BNBChain#","gravity_id":"372681400","id":74229,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T14:20:07.364Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T14:20:07.364Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T14:16:50.556Z","text_content":"$BTC  H1 OSC RIP","gravity_id":"372680391","id":74230,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T14:20:07.722Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T14:20:07.722Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T14:16:48.518Z","text_content":"$BTC i just lost all my student loan money, what do i do now","gravity_id":"372677636","id":74231,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T14:20:08.084Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T14:20:08.084Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T14:16:45.162Z","text_content":"When the job market's looking bleak, but your crypto dreams are still soaring! 🚀💼  \n\n$BTC down 3%?

This illustrates a clear example of a support/resistance flip. Additionally, $BTC has successfully filled the CME gap at $90,500, making the $90,000 zone a critical psychological threshold to maintain.

Stock futures volumes have already topped $10B in weeks, showing Bitget is clearly on a different level this year. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #BTC  #ETF","gravity_id":"372682824","id":74653,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T17:50:07.185Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T17:50:07.185Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T17:44:19.353Z","text_content":"$BTC 🪙 Bitcoin recovers · Keeping it simple\n\n#Bitcoin #BTC #BTCUSDT\n\nToday Bitcoin completed its third red day. This is all the time we are giving the market to balance things out; to take profits, to remove over leveraged positions, so that weak hands can exit at a nice price. This is the standard pause after several days of growth, three days red. From now on, Bitcoin can easily recover.\n\nI was about to start going about this and that but I realized I can just keep it simple. There is a higher low in place and Bitcoin will continue growing for sure. If you are feeling uncertainty or have any doubts or fear, you can relax yourself and rest easy, the market will continue growing. Bitcoin and the altcoins, massive growth.\n\nIf you still have doubts after reading this update, please read the charts I've been sharing about the altcoins market above this post. These will remove all doubts. The market is trading at bottom prices and ready to move ahead. Bullish momentum is only starting to build-up, ignore the short-term. This is classic short-term noise, prices will always fluctuate either on the way down or on the way up... We are going up.\n\nNamaste.","gravity_id":"372684582","id":74654,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T17:50:07.551Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T17:50:07.551Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T17:43:35.794Z","text_content":"$BTC  Based on the comprehensive monthly analysis of the provided dataset (which includes historical data and projections up to 2026), here is the breakdown of Bitcoin's percentage drops every time it reached a significant new All-Time High (ATH).  Summary of Analysis Total New ATH Months: 13 major peaks identified.  Average Major Drop: ~52.6% (for drops exceeding 20%). Key Takeaways The \"30% Rule\": During strong bull runs (like 2017), Bitcoin frequently experiences \"local\" crashes of 30-40% that recover within 1-2 months. This is considered healthy consolidation.  Cycle Tops: The \"End of Cycle\" crashes (2013, 2017, 2021) historically result in drops of 75% to 92%.  Diminishing Volatility: The magnitude of the \"Cycle Top\" crashes has slightly decreased over time:  2013: -93% 2017: -84% 2021: -77% 2025 Projection: The data suggests a more moderate ~36% drop, implying a maturing market structure similar to traditional assets. Analysis: The drop from the October 2025 peak ($126k) to the low ($80k) is 36%. This fits the profile of a \"bull market correction\" (similar to 2017) rather than a full \"bear market crash\" (>70%). Therefore, recovery is expected to be relatively fast (months, not years).","gravity_id":"372683808","id":74655,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T17:50:07.921Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T17:50:07.921Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-08T17:40:38.374Z","text_content":"💰 Coincheck Group signs 97% deal for 3iQ  Coincheck Group has agreed to acquire 97% of crypto investment firm 3iQ, broadening its footprint in digital asset investing.  #Coincheck  #3iQ  #Crypto  #Investing  $BTC    https://crypto-economy.com/coincheck-group-signs-deal-to-acquire-97-of-3iq/","gravity_id":"372682805","id":74656,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T17:50:08.172Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T17:50:08.172Z"}]
