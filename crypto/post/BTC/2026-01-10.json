The Blueprint for Institutional Trust:    • The BitTorrent Model: Vitalik compares Ethereum to BitTorrent a system that scales through pure peer-to-peer coordination without a central server. With the recent launch of PeerDAS, Ethereum is now proving this scale can coexist with decentralized consensus.   • The Linux Standard: By mirroring the Linux model, Ethereum aims to be the open-source layer that enterprises and governments trust because no single entity owns it. It is built to pass the \"Walkaway Test\" applications must keep running even if their original developers disappear.   • Solving the Trilemma: Earlier this week, Vitalik stated the Trilemma is no longer a theory. With zkEVMs and PeerDAS moving into production, Ethereum is the first network to achieve high bandwidth, security, and decentralization simultaneously.  If Ethereum follows this path, adoption won't be a loud marketing event. It will be a quiet, deep integration into the global financial and social fabric becoming as indispensable (and as hard to replace) as the internet itself. 🌐  #ETH  #VitalikButerin  #Web3  #MacroInsights  #InstitutionalCrypto","gravity_id":"372714408","id":76868,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T19:00:08.882Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T19:00:08.882Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-09T18:51:24.981Z","text_content":"$BTC this market makers will rekt btc below 88k","gravity_id":"372713458","id":76869,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T19:00:09.257Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T19:00:09.257Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-09T18:50:33.960Z","text_content":"Large $BTC holders are trimming exposure, but the market isn’t in clear distribution mode.\n\n\nAddresses holding 1k–10k $BTC are down roughly 220k $BTC year over year, the fastest decline since early 2023.

After the previous cycle’s peak, price could continue ranging within a broad demand zone, with volatility remaining elevated but direction unclear.  Rather than a straight continuation higher, this scenario suggests: • extended sideways movement • multiple tests of support • lower highs and choppy price action • a market focused more on distribution and accumulation than trend expansion  This would reflect a maturing cycle, tighter liquidity conditions, and more selective capital allocation. A deeper consolidation wouldn’t invalidate Bitcoin’s long-term thesis — it would simply reset expectations before the next major move.  Markets don’t move in straight lines. 2026 may be about patience, not hype. #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372716410","id":77050,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T21:00:09.110Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T21:00:09.110Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-09T20:49:53.583Z","text_content":"Bitcoin  $BTC had perfect phases this cycle for the Price Oscillator Pivot, and now it's returned below the 0 line to start the 3 bear market pivots.\n\nThe first of the three is currently under formation.\n\nOur data position lines up with these dates in other cycles:\n\n- March 2014\n- March 2018\n- January 2022","gravity_id":"372714953","id":77051,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T21:00:09.485Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T21:00:09.485Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-09T21:09:24.768Z","text_content":"Oh, lawmakers *finally* worried about conflicts of interest in crypto? 🙄 Maybe focus on, you know, not debasing the currency first. $BTC  doesn't need their permission. #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"372717055","id":77056,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T21:10:07.010Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T21:20:09.593Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-09T21:07:08.418Z","text_content":"Banks are finally figuring out $BTC .

After a fast start to 2026, $BTC  is hitting a \"wall\" at 90K. Here is my take on what is happening:  The Big Outflows: We just saw over $400M leave Bitcoin ETFs in a few days. When the \"big money\" stops buying or starts taking profits, it’s hard for the price to move up.  A \"Wait and See\" Mood: Many investors are nervous about upcoming US economic data. People are choosing to play it safe rather than bet on a breakout.  The 90K Level: This isn't just a number; it’s a psychological barrier. We’ve seen $BTC  get rejected near 95K recently, so 90K has become the new \"battleground.\"  My View: I think we might close slightly below 90K this week. The selling pressure from ETFs is still a bit too high, and the market needs to \"breathe\" after the early January jump. If we can hold 88K as support, I’m not worried about a big crash—it’s just a healthy pause.  What do you think? Are you buying this dip or waiting for 85K? 📉🚀  #BTC Price Analysis#  #CryptoNews  #BitcoinETF  #MarketUpdate","gravity_id":"372714987","id":77060,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T21:10:08.559Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T21:10:08.559Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-09T21:01:45.031Z","text_content":"Will Bitcoin Hold Steady This Weekend? https://ift.tt/hIlbTXB","gravity_id":"372716441","id":77061,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T21:10:08.830Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T21:10:08.830Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-09T21:00:56.298Z","text_content":"$BTC   is trying to hold above key levels this weekend amid mixed macro data and low trading volume.

After a fast start to 2026, BTC$BTC  is hitting a \"wall\" at 90K. Here is my take on what is happening:\r \r \r The Big Outflows: We just saw over $400M leave Bitcoin ETFs in a few days. When the \"big money\" stops buying or starts taking profits, it’s hard for the price to move up.\r \r \r A \"Wait and See\" Mood: Many investors are nervous about upcoming US economic data. People are choosing to play it safe rather than bet on a breakout.\r \r \r The 90K Level: This isn't just a number; it’s a psychological barrier. We’ve seen BTC$BTC  get rejected near 95K recently, so 90K has become the new \"battleground.\"\r \r \r My View: I think we might close slightly below 90K this week. The selling pressure from ETFs is still a bit too high, and the market needs to \"breathe\" after the early January jump. If we can hold 88K as support, I’m not worried about a big crash—it’s just a healthy pause.\r \r \r What do you think?

The outflows signal profit-taking from institutional flows, which has capped upside and turned $90K into a key psychological and technical pivot.  Price action shows strong supply near $90K–$91K, while bids are building below, suggesting the market is in wait-and-see mode ahead of the weekly close. A weekly close above $90K would indicate that spot demand is absorbing ETF selling and could reopen upside continuation. Conversely, a close below $90K risks a deeper pullback toward the $86K–$88K support zone, where buyers previously stepped in.  In short, ETF outflows have stalled $BTC ’s advance, and the weekly close around $90K is likely to define near-term direction strength above favors continuation, while rejection keeps BTC in consolidation. #Macro Insights#  #BTC  #BTC Correction Incoming?#  #ETF  #BingX","gravity_id":"372722006","id":77293,"createdAt":"2026-01-10T01:00:08.553Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-10T01:10:07.558Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-10T01:05:24.476Z","text_content":"Vitalik Buterin’s Ethereum Vision: Infrastructure Over Hype\n\nWhile  $BTC established digital scarcity, Vitalik Buterin is focused on making Ethereum scale like global infrastructure rather than a niche crypto product.\n\nHe compares Ethereum to Linux, open-source, neutral, and boring, yet trusted by enterprises and governments worldwide.

Not only the major ones post ATH, 2018 and 2022, but also the intermediary ones. I focused on shape, size and duration. Bitcoin is relief rally friendly.\n\nAfter a sharp drop, if the general market bias is bearish, Bitcoin tends to produce a relief rally before resuming with its bearish trend.\n\nThese relief rallies tend to happen within 10-50 days after the drop with one exception. There was one instance where it took almost two months for a relief rally to fully unravel. Normally, these tend to show up much faster.\n\nThese relief rallies fluctuate in size from a nice 35% to some 60-80%. They tend to be big. So far, in 2026, our present relief rally peaked at 17%. Meaning, there is plenty of room left for additional growth.\n\nIt's been 49 days since the 21-November low. This time window also indicates that a higher high can develop within days. Can be 3-5 days.\n\nA double-top came-in 5-January (vs 9-December). After four days red, Bitcoin's price remains strong. All the signals short-term came out as neutral. A neutral signal favors whatever was happening before the signal showed up. Bitcoin has been rising since 21-November 2025 so we have a bullish bias. This bias continues intact.\n\nIf Bitcoin drops below $90,000 before moving ahead, this should be considered a \"extreme buy opportunity.\" Buy everything you can with high lev.\n\nConclusion: Bitcoin is bullish and will continue rising.\n\nNamaste.","gravity_id":"372731019","id":77753,"createdAt":"2026-01-10T10:10:08.327Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-10T10:10:08.327Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-10T10:05:08.232Z","text_content":"Bitcoin top is NOT in at $126K yet. 📉According to analysts using the business cycle, $BTC  hasn’t hit its peak because key economic indicators like the ISM PMI haven’t crossed critical thresholds  meaning the bull run could still have room to run.

Let's Do Bitcoin DeFi Cardano Way 💙🧡\nSundial’s Bitcoin-Aware Plutus Smart Contracts proposal introduces a way for Plutus to natively understand the real BTC state. \nNo wrapped assets. No custodians. No trusted intermediaries. Just verifiable BTC logic via Cardano contracts. \n2. Bitcoin holds the largest pool of digital capital in the world, yet its holders are forced into tradeoffs when seeking yield or utility. Bridges add risk. Custody breaks trust. This proposal directly addresses that gap by allowing Cardano contracts to react to authenticated.\n3. The breakthrough is simple but powerful. Plutus contracts gain the ability to validate BTC headers, Merkle proofs, and Taproot-related conditions. BTC activity becomes a first-class input for Cardano logic, aligned with the UTxO & without introducing new trust assumptions.\n4. This matters because it changes the design space entirely. Instead of synthetic BTC or fragile bridges, developers can build DeFi primitives that respond to actual Bitcoin state while remaining fully non-custodial. This is not a bridge. It is programmable verification.\n5. @SundialProtocol is not experimenting in isolation. The work builds on proven research and existing cross-chain primitives, with institutional partners validating real-world yield and risk requirements. The goal is not novelty, but infra that serious capital can rely on.\n6. For the Cardano ecosystem, the upside is massive. Developers gain new composability. Protocols gain access to dormant BTC liquidity. BTC holders gain utility without giving up sovereignty. All delivered as open source tooling that fits cleanly into today’s Plutus environment.\n7. This proposal strengthens trust minimization, attracts external capital, and positions Cardano as the most principled environment for Bitcoin-aware DeFi. \nRead more before voting starts:\nhttps://projectcatalyst.io/funds/15/cardano-partners-tier-1-enterprise-integrations/sundials-bitcoin-aware-plutus-smart-contracts","gravity_id":"372728411","id":77777,"createdAt":"2026-01-10T10:30:07.589Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-10T10:40:08.531Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-10T10:28:45.104Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nIf #Ethereum drops below $3,000, the mainstream CEX long liquidation risk will reach $882 million\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372732094","id":77778,"createdAt":"2026-01-10T10:30:08.411Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-10T10:40:09.306Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-10T10:28:45.100Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nTelegram 2025 Financial Report Puzzle: Revenue Soars by 65%, Yet Plagued by $200 Million Loss Due to TON?\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372727434","id":77779,"createdAt":"2026-01-10T10:30:08.686Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-10T10:30:08.686Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-10T10:28:45.087Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nCZ Retweet: \"Rich Bank Buying #Bitcoin,\" Says U.S. Bank Continues to Accumulate During Retail Panic Selling\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372728410","id":77780,"createdAt":"2026-01-10T10:30:09.066Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-10T10:30:09.066Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-10T10:28:45.079Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\n「Whale」 Long Position's Unrealized Loss Grows to $610,000, #Ethereum Long Liquidation Price at $3,000.16\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372727432","id":77782,"createdAt":"2026-01-10T10:30:09.846Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-10T10:30:09.846Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-10T10:25:00.072Z","text_content":"🚀 South Korea is cooking up something spicy for crypto in 2026  They just dropped their new economic growth plan, and spot $BTC  ETFs are officially on the menu this year—finally giving local investors a regulated way to get BTC exposure without jumping through foreign loopholes. https://www.ethnews.com/south-korea-moves-toward-spot-bitcoin-etfs-in-2026-strategy/   💼 Lawmakers are still tweaking the rulebook, so it’s not live yet—but the vibe is institutional doors opening and capital staying local instead of flowing offshore.

Bitcoin is institutional accumulation and cyclical momentum that crypto veterans recognize all too well. Trading at $99,668 after a powerful rally from the $60,000-$65,000 support zone, BTC is now knocking on the door of six figures while respecting a multi-year ascending channel that's been in play since the 2020 lows.  The chart reveals a critical support zone between $60K -$65K that absorbed massive selling pressure throughout 2024, forming a rock-solid foundation for the current move. The blue projection line tells the story clearly: Bitcoin is targeting the upper boundary of its ascending channel near $150K-$160K.   Near-term resistance sits at $126,208, but the real prize is the $150K+ zone where the channel top intersects with peak cycle timing around late 2026 or early 2027.   The 2028 Bitcoin halving, marked by the red dashed line around January 2028. This event will slash block rewards from 3.125 BTC to 1.5625 BTC, cutting fresh supply in half overnight—that's roughly $23 million in daily sell pressure that simply vanishes.  History rhymes beautifully with Bitcoin halvings. The 2012 halving sparked 9,000%+ gains, 2016 delivered 2,900%+, and 2020 generated 670%+. Percentage gains decrease as Bitcoin matures, but absolute dollar gains explode.  By 2028, Bitcoin will have nearly four years of spot ETF accumulation, clearer regulatory frameworks, and potentially multiple nation-states holding BTC as strategic reserves. The supply cut hitting this backdrop of surging institutional demand creates a powder keg of bullish pressure.  The wave pattern shows $BTC   four-year cycle: we're currently in the early markup phase (2024-2025), heading toward parabolic acceleration (2026-2027), with the 2028 halving triggering the next major bull phase toward $200K+. The technical setup combined with the halving catalyst presents one of the highest-conviction long-term plays in crypto markets.","gravity_id":"372729948","id":78316,"createdAt":"2026-01-10T16:30:06.344Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-10T16:40:11.090Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-10T16:26:58.703Z","text_content":"$BTC  still has that unfilled #CME  gap from New Year’s Eve sitting near $88K and it matters. ✍️\n\nIf price slides down to close it, we could see over $2.4B in #leveraged  longs get wiped out, triggering a fast flush lower.\n\nIt’s a level #traders should keep on their radar  one dip in that direction and volatility could explode in both directions.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372729943","id":78317,"createdAt":"2026-01-10T16:30:06.592Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-10T16:30:06.592Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-10T16:25:50.915Z","text_content":"$BTC  Update: 1D  The current price movement is being influenced by significant capital.
