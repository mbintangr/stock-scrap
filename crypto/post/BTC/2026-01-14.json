The company added a substantial amount of Bitcoin during a period of market consolidation, signaling strong conviction rather than short-term speculation.

Large corporate buys also reduce available #BTC  supply on exchanges, quietly tightening the market.   \r \r \r On-chain and technical indicators suggest #Bitcoin  is building a base rather than entering a distribution phase. When combined with upcoming catalysts—such as potential rate cuts, continued ETF accumulation, and the post-halving supply shock-Strategy’s timing looks deliberate.

This time, the macro backdrop looks less restrictive, meaning a potential relief rally could last longer and develop more constructively.","gravity_id":"372818814","id":84280,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T20:30:06.748Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T20:30:06.748Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-13T20:26:40.117Z","text_content":"$BTC\nBULLISH: 🇺🇸 Eric Trump says gold profits could rotate into Bitcoin soon.\n\nIf that rotation happens, it would support the “BTC as digital gold” narrative and add fresh demand during consolidation phases.\n\nThe key is whether capital actually moves, not just headlines.\n#BTC #Bitcoin #MacroInsights","gravity_id":"372820427","id":84281,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T20:30:07.218Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T20:30:07.218Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-13T20:25:45.174Z","text_content":"BTC 94.430 $","gravity_id":"372818801","id":84282,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T20:30:07.638Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T20:30:07.638Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-13T20:20:37.840Z","text_content":"#Bitcoin  $95,000 💰    BTC    #crypto  $BTC","gravity_id":"372818779","id":84283,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T20:30:08.502Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T20:30:08.502Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-13T20:38:21.050Z","text_content":"$BTC Take-Profit target 3 ✅\nProfit: 60.5683% 📈\nPeriod: 1 Days 3 Hours 41 Minutes ⏰","gravity_id":"372818868","id":84292,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T20:40:07.600Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T20:40:07.600Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-13T20:36:00.086Z","text_content":"Why Your 2026 Portfolio Needs More Than Just $BTC   🚨  If you're a trader, it’s hard to stay excited without a solid watchlist for 2026.

As before, we’re watching the resistance zone (green). If we break and hold above it, we could see a local move toward $99,000, where price may get rejected again.  What still concerns me is that we remain inside a falling flag pattern, which points to further downside. This current move could simply be a bull trap for futures traders. There’s a massive amount of liquidity above price, and most people are expecting Bitcoin to drop — and as we know, the market often moves against the crowd.  I still believe we’ll see $80,000 at some point. I’ve already bought 2/3 of my position, but I’ve kept the remaining third in case we move lower. In short, watch the green zone closely. If we break out and consolidate above it, a move to $99,000 should be easy. Pay special attention to altcoins today — they’ve been moving strongly. If you haven’t positioned yourself before the bigger move, don’t wait too long.  In my TG-channel (link in the bio), I shared my positions that I expect to grow by 70%+.

Scenario A: Break and hold above 94k (bullish) 💸 • A clean daily close above 94k, followed by 94k acting as support on a retest • That is when 100k becomes a realistic magnet, not just a meme • If we get acceptance above 94k, the move can accelerate because sidelined buyers chase and shorts cover  Scenario B: Another wick above 94k and fade (still chop) • If BTC pops on CPI and then gives it back, it is the same range story • That would signal supply is still sitting overhead and the market is not ready for trend yet • In that case, we likely rotate back into the mid-range and keep grinding  What I am watching into the close • Does BTC hold the gains, or does it do the usual vertical selloff after the spike • Does volume expand on the breakout attempt, not just on the wick • Where does the weekly structure settle relative to 90k and 94k  What do you think?

Bitcoin climbed about 1.7% in the past 24 hours, trading above $93,000 for the first time in almost a week.  Ethereum ( $ETH  ) followed with its own push, moving toward $3,200 and holding above the key $3,000 level - even though selling pressure stayed heavy through the week. That combo usually signals buyers are absorbing supply instead of chasing blindly.  The move also triggered a classic short squeeze. Liquidations hit about $193.5M over the last 24 hours, with shorts taking most of the damage - roughly $120.3M came from traders positioned against the rally, according to Coinglass.  What stands out is the divergence with stocks. While crypto pushed higher, U.S. markets drifted lower - the S&P 500 slipped about 0.3% and the Nasdaq fell 0.2% after opening slightly green earlier Tuesday.  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372820915","id":84433,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T22:10:03.695Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T22:10:08.798Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-13T22:01:52.351Z","text_content":"UPDATE: A Bitcoin OG trader is showing nearly $17M in unrealized profit from large long positions in  $BTC,  $ETH, and SOL, according to the HyperDash screen.\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372819968","id":84434,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T22:10:04.120Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T22:10:09.635Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-13T22:00:07.576Z","text_content":"$ETH  $3,120 price has repeatedly failed to sustain levels above $3,300 over the past 60 days, leading traders to question whether a durable bullish momentum is still achievable in 2026.

Cooling inflation has strengthened expectations for future rate cuts, a macro backdrop that historically supports BTC upside.  Price action now places Bitcoin at a critical inflection zone between $92K–$94K, an area highlighted by traders as major resistance. A decisive daily or weekly close above $94K could unlock momentum toward the psychological $100,000 level, where liquidity and breakout traders are likely to engage.  Sentiment across Web3 circles remains cautiously bullish. Many analysts point to improving ETF flows and declining macro pressure as tailwinds, while warning that failure to reclaim $94K could trigger short-term consolidation or a pullback toward $90K support.  Bottom line: Soft CPI has reignited bullish momentum, but $94K is the key gate. Clear it convincingly, and the path to $100k opens.

Lose it, and BTC likely slips back into a deeper retest before trying again.  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372838256","id":85513,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T10:40:09.833Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T10:40:09.833Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T10:34:55.893Z","text_content":"Trading is 80% waiting, 20% executing.

Data shows that the move through key levels was accompanied by large-scale short liquidations, with forced buying significantly amplifying the upside momentum.\n\nNotably, despite the strong price action, market sentiment has not shifted into extreme optimism. Readings remain closer to neutral, making this rally structurally different from a typical FOMO-driven surge.\n\n#Bitcoin #BTC #CryptoMarket\nThe market’s focus has now shifted to one question: Is $100,000 the next target?\n\nThe answer depends less on headlines and more on whether sustained spot buying can hold prices once liquidation pressure fades. Without follow-through demand, upside momentum may weaken quickly.\n\nAt the same time, $100,000 represents a major options and hedging zone, where volatility tends to intensify rather than resolve cleanly. This move looks less like hype and more like a structural test — and the real verdict will come from capital flows, not narratives.\nRead More👉https://www.coinrank.io/crypto/bitcoin-sets-a-new-high-for-2026-pulls-crypto-higher-is-100000-next/ ","gravity_id":"372838230","id":85516,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T10:40:11.131Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T10:40:11.131Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T10:46:29.879Z","text_content":"Crypto Market Dominance Update 📊\r \r 🔥 Bitcoin ($BTC ): ~58.83% 🟡 $BTC \r 💎 Ethereum ($ETH ): ~11.50% 🔹 $ETH \r ⚡ BTC still rules the market, while ETH remains strong as the top alt.\r 👀 Altcoins keeping a close eye as dominance shifts 🌐\r \r #BTC   #ETH","gravity_id":"372841269","id":85519,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T10:50:02.387Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T11:00:13.116Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T10:48:40.199Z","text_content":"Crypto markets are turning bullish again as regulatory clarity improves.

Strive Enterprises ($ASST) received approval to acquire Semler Scientific ($SMLR).  This is a strategic consolidation of \"Digital Gold.\"  1. The Numbers 📊 Strive is absorbing Semler’s 5,048 $BTC . They also added 123 $BTC  at ~$91,561.  Total: Combined entity will hold ~12,797 $BTC .  Global Ranking: Strive is now the 11th largest corporate holder, surpassing Tesla and Trump Media.  2. Why This M&A Model Matters 🚀 Buying a \"Bitcoin-rich\" company like Semler allows Strive to:  Avoid market slippage from massive buy orders.  Use Semler's cash flow to fuel more $BTC  buys.  Target a high \"Bitcoin yield\" for 2026.  3. The Roadmap CEO Matt Cole aims to monetize Semler’s medical business to retire debt (including a $20M Coinbase loan) and focus on a \"pure-play\" Bitcoin entity.  My Take: We are entering the \"consolidation phase.\" Acquiring existing treasuries is now the fastest way for institutions to build massive positions without moving the spot price against themselves.

A break above that level with strong volume would signal that buyers are in control and could open the door to renewed upside toward 100,000.

Traders watching derivatives positioning and funding rates remain mindful that short-term profit taking can slow momentum even in a bullish setup.  If Bitcoin can hold above its recent breakout zone and continue to attract buying interest, clearing 94,000 would increase the likelihood of a run at 100,000.

When buying Bitcoin instantly, users should weigh fees, payment methods, security, liquidity, and transparency. Credit/debit cards and mobile payments (Apple Pay, Google Pay) offer speed, but often come with higher fees and spreads. A solid exchange should combine fast execution with clear pricing, proof-of-reserves, fraud protection, and dependable customer support.\n\n2) How Top Exchanges Compare\n\nLeading platforms like Bitget, Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and crypto(.)com all support instant Bitcoin purchases, but differ in costs and flexibility. Some prioritize ease of use and fiat on-ramps, while others offer deeper liquidity and lower spreads—especially for stablecoin-to-BTC conversions, which are often faster and more cost-efficient than card buys. Choosing the right platform depends on whether your priority is convenience, cost control, or advanced safeguards.\n\n3) Practical Steps to Buy Bitcoin Instantly\n\nStart by creating and securing your account with two-factor authentication. Next, choose a payment method, cards and mobile payments for speed, bank transfers for lower fees. Always review the quoted price, fees, and spread before confirming. After purchase, decide whether to hold  $BTC on the exchange, transfer it to a private wallet, or use it for trading, based on your risk and strategy.\n\nBottom line: Instant Bitcoin access is widely available, but smart buyers compare fees, payment options, and security features. Platforms like Bitget and its peers offer reliable solutions, understanding the trade-offs helps you move fast without sacrificing safety or cost efficiency.\n\n#Bitcoin #Altcoin","gravity_id":"372840994","id":85778,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T13:20:09.514Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T13:20:09.514Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T13:11:54.903Z","text_content":"⚡ Bitcoin Liquidity Is Tightening Again Selling pressure across Bitcoin markets is rapidly declining while BTC$BTC  is reclaiming critical levels above $92K–$95K.

The move capped a near 5% rally in 24 hours, with BTC briefly touching the $96,600 area before cooling near $95K. Momentum has clearly flipped back toward buyers.  The driver is institutional flow. U.S. spot $BTC   ETFs pulled in over $750M in net inflows in a single day. Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB led the charge, showing that demand is not slowing as price rises. This is steady absorption, not speculative chasing.  Macro conditions helped set the stage. U.S. CPI came in at 2.7%, in line with expectations, easing inflation fears and supporting risk assets. While uncertainty around Trump-era tariff court rulings remains, the market reaction shows liquidity and flows are taking priority.  Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan added fuel to the move, arguing that ETF demand is structurally bullish. Since launch, ETFs have been buying more than 100% of new Bitcoin supply. Price has not gone parabolic yet because long-term holders have been willing to sell. Hougan’s view is simple. That supply is not infinite.  If ETF inflows persist, sellers eventually run out. When that happens, marginal demand has nowhere to go but higher. That is how parabolic moves start, not from hype, but from supply imbalance.  The breakout caught traders off guard. Roughly $688M in short positions were liquidated in 24 hours, showing how crowded the downside had become. Short-term squeezes add fuel, but the bigger picture is structural.  Bitcoin is moving less on headlines and more on sustained institutional absorption. If these flows continue, this move may be the early phase of a supply-driven expansion, not just another spike.","gravity_id":"372839362","id":85850,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T14:00:07.555Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T14:00:07.555Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T13:58:23.816Z","text_content":"📊 MARKET: Over $1B in short positions will be rekt if $BTC  breaks 97,100.","gravity_id":"372839360","id":85851,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T14:00:07.995Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T14:00:07.995Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T13:57:59.212Z","text_content":"🔥 BITCOIN $BTC  IS DELEVERAGING  Bitcoin open interest is down 30%+, from $15B in Oct to $10B, as leveraged traders get flushed out (e.g. 1011 market crash).

Paradigm's Justin Slaughter called it \"a big win for Democratic Members on Senate Banking.\"\n\nHere are five key provisions that could shape crypto's future. 👇\n\n~~ Analysis by @JackInabinet ~~\n\nNo Stablecoin Yield\n\nUnder the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, stablecoin issuers will be prohibited from distributing yield back to passive token holders.\n\nTitle IV of DAMCA, which lays out the rules for how regulated banking institutions can interact with digital assets, will prohibit stablecoin issuers (as defined by the GENIUS Act) from making interest payments to holders.\n\nWhile DAMCA will allow stablecoin issuers to distribute rewards tied to actions, such as account opening incentives and cashback rewards, protecting stablecoin yield had previously been a firm \"red line\" for the crypto industry. Heavy restrictions on stablecoins risk putting crypto-native issuers at a perpetual disadvantage against the banking sector.\n\nStill, many key crypto players – including Coinbase – have surprisingly continued to back the bill's language on stablecoin yield prohibition, viewing it as the least favorable language they could tolerate without derailing the bill's momentum.\n\nCommodity Clarity\n\nTitle I of DAMCA would amend the Securities Act of 1933 to clarify when crypto network tokens transition from securities into commodities.\n\nThe SEC will publish formal guidelines within 360 days for when initial token distributors and largest recipients are considered a token's issuer. Title I establishes expansive regulations over anyone who sold, controlled, or caused the initial distribution, extending liability to related persons and SEC jurisdiction over foreign government tokens, tokens without company structures, and majority American-owned tokens.\n\nNetwork tokens can be treated as non-securities when they have no attached financial rights, such as profit sharing or ownership interest.\n\nTo certify their non-security status, asset issuers must submit written certifications to the SEC. The Commission has 60 days to deny the certification.\n\nProjects unable to certify must publish semiannual mandatory disclosures. Projects with over $25M in gross proceeds must also publish audited financial statements.\n\nTitle I will not be applied retroactively, meaning individuals who distributed tokens before enactment need not fear retroactive liability.\n\nDeFi Regulation\n\nTitle III of DAMCA outlines when crypto projects are – and are not – considered truly \"decentralized.\"\n\nA decentralized protocol allows users to make financial transactions via an \"automated rule or algorithm that is predetermined and non-discretionary\" without relying on a person to maintain custody or control over their assets.\n\nThe designation of \"non-decentralized finance trading protocol\" applies when: a person or group can control or alter functionality; the application doesn't operate based solely on code; or a person or group can restrict, censor, or prohibit user activity.\n\nNon-decentralized protocols must comply with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Bank Secrecy Act, imposing registration, conduct, disclosure, record-keeping, and supervision requirements.\n\nThis may capture non-immutable smart contract protocols with even minimal operator control, including those using multi-signature technology or trusted encryption environments.\n\nTitle III includes a carveout allowing protocol \"security councils\" to respond to incidents with \"pre-defined, temporary rules-based cybersecurity emergency measures\" without jeopardizing their decentralization status.\n\nTitle III also imposes requirements on \"web-hosted\" crypto wallets, mandating compliance with sanctions and anti-money laundering regulations. This regulation won't apply to \"any software or hardware wallet that facilitates the custody of an individual of their digital assets.\"\n\nMicro-Innovation Sandbox\n\nDAMCA will require the CFTC and SEC to establish a \"Micro-Innovation Sandbox\" within 360 days of its enactment to \"enable 10 eligible firms to test innovative activities within the United States,\" subject to applicable Federal and State securities and commodities laws.\n\nTo participate, eligible groups must be looking to conduct lawful innovative activities within the United States, and cannot employ more than 25 employees or gross more than $10M of revenue in any given fiscal year.\n\nAll applications must be jointly approved by the CFTC and SEC for entry, and participants in the program will be granted regulatory relief, which can be revoked at any time by discretion of the Commissions.\n\nSandbox participants will be required to satisfy the disclosure requirements of both Commissions when their jurisdiction is implicated, and any regulatory relief granted through the program will supersede any State securities or commodities registration requirements.\n\nProgram acceptance will be limited to 20 projects per year, and accepted firms will be limited to $20M in aggregate customer, investor, or counterparty funds.\n\nDigital Asset Kiosk Crackdown\n\nPerhaps most surprisingly, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act devotes significant attention to the regulation of digital asset kiosks – think Bitcoin ATMs.\n\nUnder Section 205 of DAMCA, digital asset kiosks will be designated as \"money transmitting businesses,\" imposing substantial regulatory burdens on operators of these cash-for-crypto machines.\n\nEvery 90 days, operators will be required to submit a detailed list of their kiosks to the Secretary of the Treasury, including the operator's legal name, trade name, the physical address of each kiosk, and the digital assets compatible with the kiosk.\n\nBefore entering into transactions, operators must disclose their terms and government-imposed consumer warnings in an easily readable manner.\n\nDigital asset kiosks will be required to furnish customers with a receipt detailing their transaction, and implement anti-fraud controls to prevent the transfer of digital assets to wallets known to be affiliated with fraudulent activity.\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury will also be empowered to set limits on single-day deposits and withdrawals at their discretion, but until such time, digital asset kiosk operators will not be permitted to conduct transactions exceeding $3.5k with \"new customers\" within any 24-hour period.","gravity_id":"372842342","id":85873,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T14:10:08.174Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T14:10:08.174Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T14:03:36.456Z","text_content":"Attention is on today’s U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) release, as markets look for signs of cooling wholesale inflation following a steady CPI earlier this week.

Until we break above it, there’s no point in talking about further upside 🧐  So keep a close eye on this level, especially if you’re not yet positioned in Bitcoin.  I’ve already bought 2/3 of my allocated capital, keeping the rest for a potential move lower. I’m still expecting a final pullback. We’re trading inside a flag pattern, which in this case points to a continuation to the downside. On top of that, the liquidity below price still hasn’t been taken.  For those who don’t know: liquidity mainly consists of stop-losses from futures traders — and as we know, stops act like a magnet for price. Where the liquidity is, price usually goes.  Ethereum looks better from a bullish perspective for now. I mentioned earlier that ETH has a support zone (green) holding price, along with a trendline (purple) that’s also preventing further downside.  As long as we stay above these zones and trendlines, the bias remains bullish. I’m holding ETH with 2/3 of my intended position as well. Overall, I expect Ethereum to reach $6,000 this year.
