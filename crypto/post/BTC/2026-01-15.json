Enjoy the pump.","gravity_id":"372848997","id":86413,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T18:40:06.986Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T18:40:06.986Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T18:33:29.631Z","text_content":"$BTC\nOverall Market Context\nCurrent price is around $98,800.\nStrong upward move from the $95,000 area.\nThis rally was largely driven by short liquidations (short squeeze).\n🔥 Key Liquidation Zones\n(Brighter = higher liquidation liquidity)\n🔴 Above Price (Short Liquidations)\n$99,600 – $101,400\nVery dense liquidity cluster.\nIf price pushes into this zone, another short squeeze is likely.\nMarket makers may try to drive price upward to clear these positions.\n🟢 Below Price (Long Liquidations)\n$96,200 – $97,000\nSignificant long liquidation area.\nA pullback into this zone could trigger long liquidations.\n$94,500 – $95,000\nStronger liquidity pool → acts as a magnet if bearish momentum appears.\n🧠 Market Maker Behavior (Liquidity Logic)\nPrice tends to move toward high-liquidity zones.\nCurrent structure shows more liquidity above than below, suggesting:\nUpside sweep first, then potential pullback.\n📈 Scenario Analysis\n✅ Bullish Scenario\nBreak and hold above $99,000\nPrice likely targets:\n$99,600\n$101,400\n⚠️ Bearish / Pullback Scenario\nFailure to break $99,000\nRetrace toward:\n$97,000\nThen $95,000\n🎯 Key Takeaway\nMarket is currently liquidity-hunting.\nUpside liquidity is dominant, favoring a move higher first.\nExpect high volatility around $99k–$101k.\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Altcoin Season# #Macro Insights# #CRYPTONINJAWORLD @Binance","gravity_id":"372851071","id":86414,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T18:40:07.340Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T18:40:07.340Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T18:33:16.028Z","text_content":"$BTC   🚀 hits a new 2026 high above $97K, with data showing bulls still have enough fuel for higher prices. 👀 Momentum points toward a potential push past $100k Stay alert for the next breakout! 💹       #BTC  #CryptoNews","gravity_id":"372850065","id":86415,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T18:40:07.596Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T18:40:07.596Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T18:32:23.648Z","text_content":"#BTC    The Bull Market EMA crossover will likely occur only once Bitcoin has overextended beyond the EMAs and then failed to retest them as new support  The crossover will likely be a lagging indicator reacting to any future weakness after this rally  $BTC  #Crypto  #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"372848989","id":86416,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T18:40:07.856Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T18:40:07.856Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T18:47:28.923Z","text_content":"$BTC\n🚨 BTC $100K JANUARY ODDS AT 50% \n\nPolymarket now shows a 50% chance Bitcoin hits $100K by January. \n\nBig signal for what’s ahead \n\nThe bulls are waking up.\n#BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372852065","id":86424,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T18:50:04.930Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T19:00:11.581Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T18:44:46.112Z","text_content":"Whale Alert: #Hyperliquid  Whale (0xa503) Long BTC with 40x leverage, entry price $96380.0, position value $2.89M.

Syscoin IS Bitcoin security via merged mining Proof-of-Work.\n\nThis thread: Why direct hashpower inheritance beats every alternative. And why young builders recognize this. 🧵 \nLet's start with what 'Bitcoin-adjacent' actually means: platforms that reference Bitcoin in marketing but use completely different security models.\n\nPoS validator sets. Bridge trust assumptions. Economic incentive alignment. These aren't Bitcoin security. They're separate systems.\nBitcoin-centered means: direct security inheritance through merged mining.\n\nWhen F2Pool, ViaBTC, or AntPool mine Bitcoin, they simultaneously secure Syscoin. Same computational work. Same cryptographic proof. Same attack cost. This is actual Bitcoin security. Not adjacent. Direct.\nWhy does this matter? Because the security you inherit can't be faked. Attack Syscoin and you need Bitcoin-level computational resources. No economic assumptions. No validator compromises. No bridge exploits.\n\nPhysical barrier requiring Bitcoin hashpower. 11 years proves it works.\nHonduras November 2025: Government deployed ballot attestation on Syscoin during contested election.\n\nWhy? Because when electoral integrity matters, you don't trust economic assumptions. You trust mathematics. Bitcoin PoW via merged mining delivers cryptographic proof governments need.\nFresh generation notices this. 200-400+ young developers per event across dozens of LATAM and Africa countries. They evaluated PoS platforms promising easy scaling. They chose Bitcoin-secured PoW.\n\nWhy? Because government validation signals: this survives pressure.\nThe Forge approaches Q1 2026: DeFi, NFT, staking, trading, swapping experiences rewarding ecosystem participation. Young developers are building this infrastructure on a Bitcoin-secured foundation. Users arriving soon to government-validated architecture.\n\nThis is why inheritance matters.\nCompetitive reality: Platforms claiming 'Bitcoin security' through PoS, bridges, or Proof of Transfer use Bitcoin's NAME. Syscoin via merged mining uses Bitcoin's HASHPOWER.\n\nThe difference isn't marketing. It's architecture proven across 11 years with zero successful Bitcoin-level attacks.\nWhy young developers choose this: They see platforms that rebranded when narratives shifted. They want a foundation that survives whatever comes next.\n\nBitcoin PoW via merged mining? 16 years Bitcoin, 11 years Syscoin. This is what survival looks like.\nThe builder lesson: Real Bitcoin security enables real government deployments enables real ecosystem growth. Honduras validated it. Young developers build on it. The Forge rewards users on it.\n\nThis is how legitimate infrastructure creates legitimate ecosystems.\nBitcoin-centered vs Bitcoin-adjacent isn't a subtle difference. Its architectural choice determines survival. \n\nA fresh generation with no crypto baggage evaluated everything. Choose direct hashpower inheritance. \n\nThey're building before The Forge launches.

It is based on the hypothesis that scarcity drives value. Under this framework, Bitcoin is scarcer than gold and could ultimately be worth more than gold.\n\nS2F is intended to capture the average price over a four-year cycle. The current cycle’s average is around $90,000, significantly higher than the previous cycle’s average of about $34,000.

Over the prior two months, Bitcoin had traded in high-level consolidation, with selling pressure near the upper range and demand emerging on pullbacks. Although prices weakened briefly in early January, there was no clear evidence of large-scale long-term holder distribution or a structural deterioration in supply-demand conditions.\n\nThe dominant explanation for this move is that spot demand and leverage unwinding occurred simultaneously under a temporarily stabilized external environment. On January 13, U.S. CPI data came in broadly in line with market expectations, easing concerns about renewed inflation acceleration and further rapid monetary tightening. This reduced macro-driven downside pressure and allowed internal market dynamics to play a larger role in price formation.\n\nIn parallel, progress reported in the U.S. Congress on digital asset market structure legislation, commonly referred to as the CLARITY Act, contributed to a stabilization in market sentiment by reducing regulatory uncertainty, even though it was not a direct short-term price catalyst.\n\nWithin this context, inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs provided the initial upward impulse. As prices approached the upper end of the range, short liquidations in the derivatives market accelerated the move through forced buybacks. The recovery in the Coinbase Premium Gap suggests that U.S.-based spot demand strengthened during this period.\n\nAt present, this price action is best viewed as a demand-driven rebound within a range. If spot demand weakens again, this interpretation would need to be reassessed.\n \nhttps://t.co/JUVxJnGjpk’s-Mid-January-Rebound:-A-Structural-Look-at-Macro-Relief,-ETF-Flows,-and-Short-Covering","gravity_id":"372851519","id":86527,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T20:10:06.223Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T20:10:06.223Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T19:58:45.260Z","text_content":"Spot buying is leading the market.\n\nBitcoin has risen from around $84,400 to $96,000 over the past few weeks.

Historically, that environment favors risk assets, and Bitcoin tends to respond early when liquidity assumptions improve.  A ruling that upholds the tariffs would still matter. It would reinforce tighter trade conditions and maintain uncertainty around costs, which could slow risk appetite and cool BTC momentum. This is why BTC remains exposed even before a verdict. Markets trade expectations first, and price reflects that tension.  Structurally, BTC has confirmed a breakout from a cup-and-handle formation, clearing the $94,000 supply zone and flipping it into support. Price is now trading near $97,000 after a strong move fueled by recent CPI data. Buyers are in control, and the character of the move suggests expansion rather than a false break.  Momentum indicators reinforce that view. Directional strength has surged, showing buyer dominance and trend confirmation rather than exhaustion. With structure aligned and participation strong, a rotation toward the $100,000 level appears increasingly likely.  The key level to watch is $94,000. As long as BTC holds above that zone, the breakout remains valid. A breakdown would weaken the setup and shift price back into consolidation.","gravity_id":"372853793","id":86534,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T20:20:06.091Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T20:20:06.091Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T20:17:50.823Z","text_content":"🚨 ALTSEASON CONDITIONS ARE ALIGNING — AND THE DATA IS SCREAMING 🚨\n\n\nEvery major crypto cycle tells the same story. Different narratives, same mechanics.\nAnd right now, those mechanics are lining up again.\n\n\n📊 What the data is showing:\n• OTHERS/BTC sitting at historically suppressed, multi-cycle lows\n• OTHERS.D coiling for expansion 📈\n• Risk appetite quietly rotating beneath the surface\n\n\nThere is one final trigger the market is waiting for 👇\n\n\n🔥 BTC.D breaking decisively below 55%. 🔥\n\n\nThat moment is closer than most are prepared for.\n\n\n🧠 For altseason to fully ignite, history demands:\n✅ BTC pushes higher → then goes sideways (distribution, not collapse)\n✅ Ethereum outperforms BTC and reclaims strength above $4,000\n✅ Capital rotates from safety → into risk assets\n\n\nAll of these conditions are stacking for a March–April 2026 altseason, a phase where risk assets historically outperform every other asset class.\n\n\nI know I sound like a broken record repeating these metrics — but that’s because 📚 the data and the history books never change. Markets don’t reward hype. They reward patience, positioning, and conviction.\n\n\n⚠️ This is the phase where:\n• Assets feel uncomfortable\n• Sentiment is weak\n• Conviction gets tested\n• Risk looks “unrewarding”\n\n\nAnd yet… this is exactly where generational opportunities are built.\n\n\n🧱 BOTTOM LINE:\n\n\nI want my audience to win. But winning means trusting the process.\n\n\nRisk assets always hurt before they reward. Volatility is the entry fee. Drawdowns are part of the game.\n\n\nEven if we go 90% down, the ones who stay disciplined are the ones who reap the upside when expansion arrives 🚀\n\n\nPosition early. Stay rational. Let the data lead — not emotions.\n\n\n#Altseason #BitcoinDominance #CryptoCycles #RiskAssets #UrxrlTrading $BTC","gravity_id":"372853792","id":86535,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T20:20:06.351Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T20:20:06.351Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T20:17:02.761Z","text_content":"$BTC Weekly\n\n\nPeople are not reading my 84K $BTC Long threads now\nBack in days they criticised me for being on Long side\n\n\nThey did once more when I gave them 126K TOP selling to 91K\n\n\nAnd they will criticise me once again\n\n\nGoing to stick over my path\n54K coming up","gravity_id":"372852502","id":86536,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T20:20:06.615Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T20:20:06.615Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T20:16:45.084Z","text_content":"Bitcoin miner CleanSpark just made a big move!\n\nThey acquired a Texas site to boost AI/HPC operations and add 2.4 EH/s to their BTC mining capacity.\n\nThis added hashrate indicates slight downward pressure on hashprice from increased network competition.\n\nSecure your hashpower edge on Lumerin.","gravity_id":"372851600","id":86537,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T20:20:06.790Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T20:20:06.790Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T20:15:30.613Z","text_content":"$BTC TO 100k before the weekend","gravity_id":"372851591","id":86538,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T20:20:06.940Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T20:20:06.940Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T20:15:02.884Z","text_content":"$BTC is about to reclaim $98K are we back?","gravity_id":"372852487","id":86539,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T20:20:07.135Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T20:20:07.135Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T20:14:54.362Z","text_content":"$BTC realex","gravity_id":"372853774","id":86540,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T20:20:07.390Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T20:20:07.390Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T20:29:33.968Z","text_content":"💥 Called it!   $BTC is now 98k⚡\nAs I said, next stop… 100k 🚀🔥\nDon’t just watch, join the ride.","gravity_id":"372851653","id":86546,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T20:30:05.015Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T20:40:06.167Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-14T20:28:49.249Z","text_content":"The US stock market vs $BTC .

Ukraine bans Polymarket as gambling! Thailand hunts gray money across gold and crypto! Nigeria ties exchanges to tax IDs! Dubai dumps token whitelist!\n\nLet's unpack this week's crypto adoption madness. 🧵\n\n1/8\n📈 Market Overview\n\nUSD1 stablecoin hits $3.4B market cap as sovereign deals multiply. Polymarket is restricted in 34 countries despite an $8B valuation. Governments shift from blockchain surveillance to identity-based reporting, linking crypto flows to tax systems, national IDs, and AML hubs.\n\n2/8\n🇵🇰 Pakistan\n\nPakistan signs a deal with SC Financial Technologies (World Liberty Financial affiliate) to explore USD1 stablecoin for cross-border payments and remittances. USD1 has already moved $2B for Abu Dhabi's Binance stake. Pakistan is building Bitcoin reserves, licensing exchanges, and eyeing tokenized assets.\n\n3/8\n🇺🇦 Ukraine\n\nUkraine blocks Polymarket under unlicensed gambling laws, adding the domain to the national ban registry. Authorities slammed the platform for hosting bets on Russian invasion outcomes. Polymarket is now restricted in 34 countries, including France, Germany, the UK, and Poland.\n\n4/8\n🇹🇭 Thailand\n\nThailand launches a \"gray money\" crackdown on gold and crypto as parallel laundering channels. Includes lower gold reporting thresholds, stricter Travel Rule enforcement, and a national data hub for real-time monitoring. PM orders \"integrated force\" to fight analogue and digital financial crimes.\n\n5/8\n🇳🇬 Nigeria\n\nNew tax law requires crypto exchanges to link transactions to tax IDs and national ID numbers starting Jan. 1. Virtual asset providers must file customer data and transaction details with tax authorities. Identity-based model replaces blockchain surveillance and aligns with OECD's global Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework.\n\n6/8\n🇦🇪 UAE\n\nDubai's DFSA scraps token whitelist, shifts vetting to licensed firms in DIFC free zone. Companies now assess token suitability under principles-based rules. Privacy coins like Monero and Zcash face tougher internal scrutiny despite no explicit ban. VARA maintains direct prohibition authority outside DIFC.\n\n7/8\n💡 Key Takeaways\n\n🔹 Stablecoins win sovereign partnerships while prediction markets get banned\n🔹 Tax IDs and national databases replace on-chain surveillance\n🔹 Privacy tools squeezed by compliance-first frameworks\n🔹 Fragmented enforcement, unified direction; governments control the rails\n\n8/8","gravity_id":"372863443","id":87222,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T07:30:05.845Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T07:30:05.845Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T07:24:22.958Z","text_content":"JUST IN: Bitcoin $BTC  ETFs bought $750 MILLION BTC yesterday  BlackRock led with $351 MILLION  Largest daily inflow since October 🐂","gravity_id":"372863436","id":87223,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T07:30:06.029Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T07:30:06.029Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T07:24:11.145Z","text_content":"TRADE: $RIVER/USDT\n🟥 SHORT\n\n🌟 Entry Parameters\n✅ Entry range: 22.625 – 22.86\n\n🎯 Targets:\n💰 22.453\n💰 22.221\n💰 22.005\n💰 21.782\n💰 21.562\n💰 21.365\n\n🌟 Risk Management\n❌ StopLoss: 23.443\n\n🔰 Leverage: 5x – 20x\n $BTC $RIVER","gravity_id":"372864415","id":87224,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T07:30:06.180Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T07:30:06.180Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T07:23:46.570Z","text_content":"$BTC  ,\r Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned of рolitical pressure on the Fed, spаrking safe‑haven demand and a sharp crypto rally. #Bitcoin  аnd #Ethereum  climbed strongly whilе   https://transscreen.ru/en/CMK_news29127 privacy coins also jumped amid rising macro optimism and sоfter risk‑off flows. #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372864411","id":87225,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T07:30:06.373Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T07:30:06.373Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T07:22:47.796Z","text_content":"The AI Master 2026 blessing straight gave \"Value HODLer\" energy  Buy, forget, let time cook I'm locked in on that vibe.

Gold is soaring above $4,600 per ounce, and silver has shattered $90, reaching over $5 trillion in market cap. This rush into hard assets signals growing global uncertainty and for many, it’s setting the stage for $BTC  next move.  $BTC , at $95,000, has been more restrained, but this isn’t a weakness. Instead, it’s part of a familiar pattern: Bitcoin tends to follow gold, just with a lag of 4-7 months. According to André Dragosch of Bitwise, gold’s moves historically anticipate Bitcoin’s and we’re likely seeing that dynamic in play now. 🟡🔜💻  What’s happening? • Gold’s parabolic rally (+65% in 2025) was driven by central banks hoarding reserves. • Bitcoin’s spot ETFs have absorbed 100% of new supply, putting upward pressure on price once long-term holders run out of ammunition. • Fed instability and macro uncertainty are fueling a move towards assets immune to political risk - Bitcoin fits the bill as a “convex hedge”.  Analysts point to a potential short-term target of $120K–$130K for Bitcoin, aligning with the Gold-to-Bitcoin rotation thesis. Bitcoin’s scarcity effect is now kicking into gear, much like gold in 2025.

On-chain data is starting to whisper something interesting and it’s not noise.  According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s market structure is quietly resetting in a way that has historically preceded bullish reversals.  What’s happening under the hood? • $BTC   derivatives open interest is down 31% over the last 3 months - a textbook deleveraging phase. • Leverage ratios continue to cool off, flushing out excess risk. • CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost notes that similar conditions in the past often marked market lows, not tops. 🟢  This kind of reset matters. Strong trends rarely start from overcrowded, over-leveraged markets - they start after pain, patience, and cleanup.  But let’s stay sharp. • If $BTC  keeps sliding, more deleveraging is still possible. • This setup increases probability, not certainty.  👉 What makes this phase especially interesting is how utility-driven assets behave during resets.  Take WhiteBIT Coin (WBT) as a real example. In 2025, WBT delivered +131% growth, reaching an ATH above $60 - not on hype, but on expanding real utility: fee discounts, trading advantages, and deeper integration into regulated infrastructure. That kind of performance during volatile cycles shows what markets tend to reward once leverage is washed out.  The takeaway? Bitcoin is at a structural crossroads. If the reset completes, the next move may not be driven by leverage - but by fundamentals, utility, and capital rotation.  The coming weeks won’t be loud. But they will be decisive. 👀 #BTC Price Analysis#  #BullRun  #BTC100K","gravity_id":"372875496","id":87667,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T13:20:06.353Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T13:20:06.353Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T13:29:51.907Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $BTC","gravity_id":"372870331","id":87678,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T13:30:15.905Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T13:30:15.905Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T13:29:48.828Z","text_content":"I’m bearish on $BTC","gravity_id":"372875613","id":87679,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T13:30:16.177Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T13:30:16.177Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T13:28:45.180Z","text_content":"When Bitcoin and Ether decide to party, shorts get liquidated! 💧💸 \n\nRemember, in crypto, it’s always highs and lows! \n\nCheck out the action here: https://kanalcoin.com/p/bitcoin-ether-price-surge-liquidations.webm \n\n#Bitcoin #Ethereum #CryptoMeme #InvestSmart","gravity_id":"372877530","id":87680,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T13:30:16.454Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T13:30:16.454Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T13:25:38.401Z","text_content":"$BTC  CME after marking the potential reaction zone on the trendline near the 0.618 golden ratio, price moved into a slow accumulation phase.

When you buy a bond, you’re lending money to a government or company in exchange for fixed interest payments and the return of your principal at maturity. They’re less volatile than stocks or crypto and are often used for stability and income.\n\nBond prices move opposite to interest rates, making them a key signal for inflation, central bank policy, and market sentiment.

This transition often appears near early reversal zones, where genuine demand begins absorbing remaining supply and price starts to curl upward.  Key observations: • Strong green spikes signal aggressive bid-side absorption from spot buyers • The prolonged red sell-pressure streak from late 2025 is weakening, reducing downside momentum • Price structure is tightening to the upside, with order flow aligning toward bullish continuation setups  Overall, $BTC  is forming the early foundation of an upside re-accumulation phase, as spot flows once again begin to support bullish momentum rather than distribute into strength.

Investments would then be pointless and would weaken, and ultimately destroy, the crypto market.","gravity_id":"372873821","id":87875,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T15:10:12.720Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T15:10:12.720Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T15:03:46.820Z","text_content":"BlackRock Drops $840M Into Bitcoin ETFs\r \r 📊 Sentiment: bullish\r \r 💰 Coins: $BTC   Key Points (Data-Driven):\r \r ✓ BlackRock's IBIT absorbed $840M in single-day inflows - largest since launch\r ✓ Total Bitcoin ETF inflows hit $919M as institutions flood back in\r ✓ This marks 5th consecutive day of net inflows after 2-week drought\r Market Insights (High-Impact):\r \r ⚡ BlackRock leading the charge signals institutional FOMO phase beginning - retail follows within 2-3 weeks historically\r ⚡ At $840M daily pace, ETFs would absorb entire new Bitcoin supply in under 4 days\r ⚡ This accumulation pattern mirrors November 2023 pre-rally when similar inflows preceded 60% BTC surge","gravity_id":"372881516","id":87876,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T15:10:13.080Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T15:10:13.080Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T15:17:24.221Z","text_content":"🚨 #Bitcoin dipped under 96,000 dollars right after the US markets opened\n\n\n$BTC","gravity_id":"372881617","id":87886,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T15:20:04.951Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T15:40:06.327Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T15:16:45.180Z","text_content":"Cryptocurrencies Most Frequently Mentioned on X Revealed for the First Time - Bitcoin and Two Altcoins at the Top\nhttps://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cryptocurrencies-most-frequently-mentioned-on-x-revealed-for-the-first-time-bitcoin-and-two-altcoins/?feed_id=62301&_unique_id=69690251e52b8","gravity_id":"372883284","id":87887,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T15:20:05.218Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T15:40:06.658Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T15:16:45.065Z","text_content":"Global cryptocurrency markets experienced significant turbulence today as Bitcoin, the world's leading digital asset, plunged below the critical $96,000 threshold. #BITCOIN #CRYPTOCURRENCY #Finance #MarketAnalysis #trading\nhttps://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-below-96000-analysis/ ","gravity_id":"372881603","id":87888,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T15:20:05.494Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T15:40:06.921Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T15:16:45.064Z","text_content":"Bitcoin Price Rallies as Whales Turn Bullish, What’s Next for BTC?\nhttps://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2026/01/15/bitcoin-price-rallies-as-whales-turn-bullish-whats-next-for-btc/\n#Bitcoin #BTC","gravity_id":"372883276","id":87889,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T15:20:05.771Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T15:30:07.106Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T15:16:45.051Z","text_content":"Mezo opens pre-deposit vaults to bring liquidity to bitcoin native infrastructure\n\nthese guys are some of the og bitcoin defi teams, they have some heavy backing on it and been running their bitcoinfi accelerator. \n\nnow @mezonetwork is closer and closer to TGE and their launch, now they are allocating up to 2.5% of their supply towards this campaign. \n\nI am looking forward to see whats next for mezo and their token launch, hopefully the latest market is good timing for it.","gravity_id":"372881600","id":87890,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T15:20:06.040Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T15:30:07.377Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T15:15:45.386Z","text_content":"Gold is dropping hard!\n\nMoney is flowing into $BTC","gravity_id":"372879037","id":87891,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T15:20:06.204Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T15:30:07.647Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T15:14:51.170Z","text_content":"Michael Saylor’s STRATEGY raised $25 BILLION to buy Bitcoin $BTC   in 2025  100× their first Bitcoin buy in August 2020 ($250M) 🚀","gravity_id":"372873877","id":87892,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T15:20:06.418Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T15:30:07.916Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T15:14:17.949Z","text_content":"$BTC  is still holding above the $96,000 level.

It clearly highlights the altcoin market cap growth in 2017 and 2021 — the periods when we last saw massive altcoin rallies.  From 2021 until now, the market has been in a downtrend, with Bitcoin dominance increasing. But things are changing.  Now focus on the trendline (white). Once it’s broken, the trend shifts bullish and a broad altcoin rally begins — just like in 2017 and 2021. We’ve already had three attempts to break above it without success. From my experience, any major trend usually breaks on the 3rd–5th attempt.  That’s why I believe the breakout and the real move will happen within the yellow zone, followed by a very strong rally 🔥  That said, not everything will pump. I don’t believe in that. The market has changed, there are too many coins, and 99% of them are junk.  ETH is a must-have — I already explained my $6,000 target for this year in a previous post.

The market is simply catching its breath.\nThe Bullish Path: We are watching for a decisive high-volume push above the $98.4K - $100K resistance block. Clearing this hurdle is the trigger that opens the path straight to $102,000 - the confirmation level that would turn the six-digit psychological barrier into a new floor.\nThe Support Zone: Downside risk remains manageable as long as price action respects the\n$93.9K - $96.6K band.

At the same time, #Coinbase  — the main source of sell-side pressure during the consolidation — has noticeably slowed down. This removes a chunk of overhead supply and helps price stabilize.
