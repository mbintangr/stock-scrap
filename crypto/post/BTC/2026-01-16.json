For example: Say January closes at $104,000. It can go higher during the month but by the time it closes the price is 104K. This is the open for February.\n\nIn February prices start rising and we get $110,000, $115,000 even $118,000 and so on. 13-February Bitcoin is at its highest, in this example can be any price between $114,000 to $120,000 or anything you think is possible. As the month reaches a close, prices start to go down. By the end of February we get $105,000 and the month ends.\n\nSee how in this example we get an open price of $104,000 and a close at $105,000 and we still get a green close on the monthly session. The upper wick would reach $114,000 or $120,000, whatever was the peak price.\n\nBut what about March?\n\nIt is the same. Let's assume we get a red close in March but this doesn't mean that the entire month we get bearish action. Say March opens at $105,000 and Bitcoin goes up to $112,000. Slowly but it gets there. Then it starts to go down, it fluctuates down and up but the month ends up closing at $100,000 and this gives us a red close. $105,000 the open vs $100,000 the close.\n\nThe ensuing months bearish momentum can intensify. This is all assuming we get a repeat of the last relief rally in 2022 which lasted two months.\n\nThese are just some examples to have an idea as to what we can expect. Whenever Bitcoin grows just a tiny bit, the altcoins will produce a strong reaction.\n\nHow to know when the bear market bottom is in?\n\nWhen Bitcoin hits bottom, maybe after three months red after the end of the bullish period (five months total, three months for the intensity, steep decline and bearish momentum), we can know because of a major. \n\nNamaste.","gravity_id":"372879910","id":88132,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T18:00:08.206Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T18:00:08.206Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T18:07:10.059Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $BTC","gravity_id":"372882540","id":88141,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T18:10:06.552Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T18:10:06.552Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T18:05:16.828Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $BTC","gravity_id":"372879969","id":88142,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T18:10:06.827Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T18:10:06.827Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T18:04:50.822Z","text_content":"Today the chatter is about $ 4?

A bounce from the current support strengthens the probability of hitting the channel’s upper boundary.\nKey Drivers & Risks\nBullish Catalysts: Heavy institutional adoption, sovereign wealth fund entries, and the historical post-halving cycle (2025–2026) align with this peak window.\nBearish Risks: Extreme overbought conditions and potential \"Whale\" profit-taking near $140k. Macroeconomic shifts or regulatory crackdowns remain the primary threats to the channel's stability.\nCritical Support Zones\nIf Wave 4 extends below $90,000, watch these levels:\nPrimary ($84,000 – $88,000): Most common Fibonacci retracement. A bounce here keeps the $140k target highly probable.\nSecondary ($78,000 – $81,000): Deep correction zone. Holding here keeps the count valid but suggests a slower recovery.\nLine in the Sand ($68,000 – $72,000): The \"Must-Hold\" Golden Pocket. Dropping below $68k invalidates the bullish impulsive count and may signal a long-term trend reversal.\nConclusion:\nThe technical outlook remains bullish with a target range of $120k–$150k. However, strict risk management and stop-loss orders are essential due to high volatility near cycle peaks.\nDisclaimer: Technical analysis only; not financial advice.\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372885276","id":88222,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T19:00:06.043Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T19:00:06.043Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T18:57:10.078Z","text_content":"Crypto Market Structure Bill Stalls as Senate Banking Postpones Markup.

Volume faded (about -20%) but derivatives open interest rose (about +11%), which usually means leverage is rebuilding even though price is not trending yet.

Here’s the gist: the Advance/Decline Index for the top 100 cryptocurrencies has been in a steady downtrend since late 2021.  Back in 2020–2021, $BTC ’s growth was supported by: a rising tide of altcoins, massive liquidity inflows from retail and institutional investors.  Fast forward to today: $BTC ’s growth is largely driven by defensive demand and institutional buying, while altcoins are losing investor interest and liquidity, and the constant launch of new coins just spreads the volume thinner.  “Bitcoin’s bull market masked altcoin weakness for years.

According to the latest ECB projections (December 2025), real GDP growth is forecast at 1.2%, down from ~1.4% in 2025. Other forecasts are similar: OECD, Conference Board, Mastercard, and FT consensus around 1.2%, Allianz slightly lower at 1.1%, and Nomura expects gradual improvement later in 2026.\nSignals supporting weaker growth:\nManufacturing PMI (Dec 2025): 48.8 – deeper contraction, lowest in 9 months, with Germany performing worst, signaling industrial weakness that can drag the economy.\nComposite PMI (Dec 2025): 51.5 – still expansion, but declining from November → growth slowing at the end of Q4.\nOther risks:\nUS tariffs / trade wars impacting exports (cars, chemicals, machinery)\nFiscal tightening in France, Spain, Italy\nWeak consumer demand, high savings, slower wage growth\nStructural challenges: aging population, competition from China, EV transition\nPositive factors include continued services growth (~52 PMI), low inflation (~1.9%), and fiscal support from Germany and NGEU funds. However, if manufacturing remains weak or trade frictions worsen, growth could fall closer to 0.8–1.0%.\nImplications for rates and markets:\nIf growth slows faster than expected, the likelihood of additional ECB rate cuts in 2026 rises. Markets currently price little change, but a few disappointing data releases could change that quickly.\nInvestor takeaway: The scenario “slower growth → more cuts → positive for markets” is still alive. Stay invested and hold your positions, as weaker growth with potential rate cuts generally supports financial markets.","gravity_id":"372884987","id":88337,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T20:20:05.028Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T20:30:07.210Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T20:17:12.229Z","text_content":"Time for #Bitcoin to recover the STH  $BTC Cost price and trigger the full reversal\n\n#BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372885781","id":88338,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T20:20:05.327Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T20:30:07.490Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T20:14:02.966Z","text_content":"$BTC And up","gravity_id":"372887323","id":88339,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T20:20:05.601Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T20:30:07.764Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T20:27:23.259Z","text_content":"Bitcoin Update 🔍  $BTC  continues to face resistance around the Bull Market EMA cluster, which could trigger a post-breakout retest near $93,500.

This often signals a shift in market structure from bearish to bullish, as sellers are exhausted, and buyers regain control. In the context of the 1-hour timeframe, this BOS occurred after a sharp decline, suggesting the downmove was a liquidity grab rather than a trend continuation.\n\n➡️Inducement: The recent dip to the $94,500 area appears to function as an inducement—a deliberate fakeout designed to trap short-sellers by sweeping liquidity below key levels before reversing higher. This is evident in the elongated wick on the downside candles, followed by bullish engulfing patterns. Such moves are common in volatile assets like Bitcoin, where smart money manipulates price to accumulate positions at discounted levels. \n\n➡️Points of Interest (POI): Multiple POIs are visible, including potential order blocks and fair value gaps around $94,000–$95,000. These areas have acted as support, with price respecting them during the pullback. For instance, the gray shaded zone on the chart likely represents a high-volume node or imbalance, where institutional buying interest is concentrated. Re-testing and holding these POIs reinforces the bullish setup, as they often precede expansions to the upside.\n\n➡️Trendline Respect: The ascending trendline (drawn from lower lows on the left side of the chart) has been respected, with price bouncing off it during the recent low. This trendline, potentially connecting supports from early January, indicates underlying upward momentum. As long as price remains above this line (currently around $94,000), the path of least resistance is higher, targeting prior resistance levels\n\n#BTC  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372890721","id":88529,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T23:10:05.405Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T23:30:06.992Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T23:06:20.621Z","text_content":"$BTC  #BTC  slipped below $ 97,000 as funding rates stalled and retail trаders stayed on thе sidelines.\r will TradFi flоws reignite a push to $ 100,000? #Macro Insights#   https://transscreen.ru/en/CMK_news29147","gravity_id":"372890692","id":88530,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T23:10:05.676Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T23:30:07.265Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T23:05:46.727Z","text_content":"$BTC   RED RT MEANS  IMPORTANT ZONE  RESISTANCE AND SUPPORT (ZONE)","gravity_id":"372889793","id":88531,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T23:10:05.951Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T23:30:07.540Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T23:05:00.068Z","text_content":"#Bitcoin Finally reached $97,000 !\n\nAs promised,\nI want to change someone's life and send 0.5  $BTC (~$48,500) to one person by tomorrow.\n\nJust like, retweet and comment 'done'.\nRandom winner in 24 hours","gravity_id":"372889787","id":88532,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T23:10:06.218Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T23:20:06.862Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T23:03:42.004Z","text_content":"US Senate Democrats to meet again with crypto industry representatives tomorrow about the Bitcoin and crypto market structure legislation $BTC ☑️","gravity_id":"372889779","id":88533,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T23:10:06.513Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T23:20:07.072Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T23:03:14.462Z","text_content":"Bitcoin Means Self Sufficiency\n\n\nI’m at the grand opening of the Michigan Bitcoin Trade Council in Lansing, Michigan.\n\n\nAmber Harris is the Managing Director of the Michigan Bitcoin Trade Council (MiBTC).\n\n\nFollow the Michigan Bitcoin Trade Council\n\n\nhttps://x.com/angelofyhvh/status/2011935657187275217?s=46&t=Kxud7JVUlu_OLFIOPp14PA\n\n\n$BTC","gravity_id":"372890670","id":88534,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T23:10:06.706Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T23:20:07.270Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-15T23:15:52.936Z","text_content":"A pullback to $94,500 would be healthy to retest the top of the pattern and confirm $95K as support.

In response, U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said that the handling of such assets does not fall within his remit and would be addressed by other government departments. At the same time, he emphasized that this week marks a critical juncture for U.S. crypto regulation, as the Senate is set to review a bipartisan crypto bill aimed at providing a clearer regulatory framework for the industry and clarifying the division of responsibilities between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

The resistance at $94,500 was broken, and the price has paused at a level that once served as support: $97,666.  We can now say that the price is undergoing a retest. However, looking deeper, the move was primarily driven by leveraged futures positions. Spot CVD showed a slight increase, but OI remains flat. If this situation doesn’t change, the price will likely be unable to move higher and will instead follow the obligations created by the long futures positions.  In any case, we’re now at a decision-making stage. One could consider entering a long position from the former resistance at $94,500, but only with a proper SL and a TP target around $100k — if you’re afraid of missing out. If not, it’s better to monitor how events unfold, especially with the weekend approaching.  Ultimately, until spot buying shows confident growth, most of what we see remains part of the game.  DYOR.

In that scenario, upside attempts are more likely to face distribution, and price action typically remains choppy as the market continues working through a recovery phase rather than transitioning into a sustained expansion.\n\nIn short, the STH cost basis remains a key on-chain level to watch, acting as a line between recovery and renewed momentum for Bitcoin.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights# #Altcoin Season# #Meme Alpha#","gravity_id":"372901645","id":89039,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T08:30:05.878Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T08:30:05.878Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-16T08:23:15.217Z","text_content":"$BTC .\n\n\nHolding up above the crucial resistance zone for support.\n\n\nAgain, as long as the 21-Day MA is beneath us, the trend is up and it's just a matter of time until it breaks to the next level, which is $100K.\n#Macro Insights# #Meme Alpha# #Altcoin Season# #BNBChain#","gravity_id":"372901633","id":89040,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T08:30:06.163Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T08:30:06.163Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-16T08:22:50.267Z","text_content":"Are u ready for this???😉\n\nALTSEASON 2026.... $BTC","gravity_id":"372902521","id":89041,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T08:30:06.454Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T08:30:06.454Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-16T08:21:34.512Z","text_content":"BREAKING: \n\n🇺🇸 BofA CEO warns that interest-bearing stablecoins could drain $6 trillion from U.S. banks.\n\nCrippling lending and sending borrowing costs soaring.\n\nTranslation: banks are insanely afraid of crypto.  $BTC","gravity_id":"372902508","id":89042,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T08:30:06.676Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T08:30:06.676Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-16T08:39:25.953Z","text_content":"[{\"sourceId\":\"6969f7bc69480f35c16ccc32\",\"tldr\":\"Bitcoin's ETF-driven growth signals a shift to institutional investments, enhancing its strategic asset status.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/6968bb5ada144f66edc174b0\",\"relevantWord\":\"ETF-driven growth\",\"score\":\"8.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"6969f7bb69480f35c16ccc2d\",\"tldr\":\"Bitcoin achieves substantial growth to $97,000, propelled by institutional adoption, clearer regulatory frameworks, and strong network infrastructure, reflecting major shifts in market structure and showcasing robust institutional confidence.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/6968bb598f36e961360f07a8\",\"relevantWord\":\"institutional adoption\",\"score\":\"8.0\"}]","gravity_id":"372901816","id":89047,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T08:40:05.558Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T08:50:06.504Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-16T08:37:45.057Z","text_content":"Digital Wealth Safeguard: A Nation Turns to Bitcoin https://ift.tt/wOql1fL","gravity_id":"372901781","id":89048,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T08:40:05.844Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T08:50:06.796Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-16T08:37:45.036Z","text_content":"If $BTC reaches $200K this year, what’s your first tweet?","gravity_id":"372901779","id":89049,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T08:40:06.123Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T08:50:07.127Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-16T08:37:01.299Z","text_content":"$BTC  WHICH MEMECOIN SHOULD I POST ABOUT?

While this has caused a minor dip, the asset is currently fighting to maintain its ground above the psychological $95,000 mark.\n\nThe Support Zones That Matter\nIn the current 2026 market structure, the logic remains focused on two key levels. As long as Bitcoin stays above the $93,500 - $94,000 zone, the overall bullish setup is still active. This area represents a significant accumulation zone for institutional players who have been driving the recent rally.\n\nKey Scenarios:\nBullish Case: A successful bounce from $94,000 confirms that the 50W EMA rejection was merely a \"liquidity grab\" before the next leg up.\n\nBearish Case: A decisive 4-hour candle close below $93,500 would invalidate the immediate bullish momentum and could lead to a deeper retracement.\n\nMy Perspective: Professional trading in 2026 is about tracking the \"engine\" behind the moves—understanding volume and structural support rather than just chasing green candles. The next 48 hours will be crucial for confirming the trend direction.\n\nCommunity Discussion: Are you seeing this dip as a \"bear trap\" or are you moving to stables until $93.5K is confirmed as support? 💬\n\n#Bitcoin #BTC #CryptoAnalysis #TradingStrategy #MarketUpdate","gravity_id":"372910052","id":89347,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T12:32:21.097Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T12:40:07.969Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-16T12:29:47.703Z","text_content":"CRAZY: 🤯 Satoshi Nakamoto is now the world’s 12th richest person.\n\n\nAnd still, no one knows who he is. $BTC","gravity_id":"372907132","id":89348,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T12:32:21.380Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T12:40:08.254Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-16T12:28:23.417Z","text_content":"New York's DA wants to jail people for using crypto 😂  They're finally realizing Bitcoin is the only way to play this game.

A daily close above 98,000 is decisive Analysts at Glassnode point out that the area around 98,000 is particularly important. This level corresponds to the average entry price of short-term holders.  “Reclaiming this level means recent buyers are back in profit.
