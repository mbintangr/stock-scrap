With the Fed still cautious, inflation refusing to cool, and geopolitical risks rising, institutions are choosing capital preservation first, upside later.  Why Gold is winning (for now): 🔹 Gold just delivered its strongest year since 1979 (+61%, ATH ~$4,600) 🔹 Major banks are already calling for $5,000 gold by 2026 🔹 ~$2.7B has flowed into tokenized gold products 🔹 In uncertainty, institutions always choose safety before growth  My view: This isn’t a long-term shift, it’s a waiting phase.  Big money is parked in gold, watching macro conditions. Once fear fades and clarity returns, that capital won’t stay in a low-volatility asset.  It rotates back into #Bitcoin  . That rotation is the real catalyst.

The Thunder Wallets are going to give more usable coins to the economy over time which can be interpreted as a version of inflation much like bitcoin has a max supply of 21 Million, but usable coins enter the economy every 10 minutes to a lucky miner. \n\nHowever, RAIN’s inflation is different. Think of it this way, when new coins go to a special segment of the holders, there is an imbalance. For bitcoin all the inflation goes to miners and they become a source of dilution to all other holders. The slice of the pie going to miners gets bigger over time, and everyone else’s slice of pie gets smaller. It’s ugly even though it does make sense in bitcoin’s system. \n\nFor RAIN, everyone’s slice gets larger at the same rate. So yes there is more usable supply entering the system, BUT no one is at a disadvantage. In our case the entire pie is getting bigger, not just a special slice. Is this inflation? No because no one’s value is being diluted.","gravity_id":"372921849","id":90225,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T22:20:06.586Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T22:20:06.586Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-16T22:16:45.114Z","text_content":"Riot's stock surged 12% with a new AMD deal for a Texas AI data center expansion.\n\nThis move by a major Bitcoin miner signals a strategic diversification into high-demand AI infrastructure.\n\nSuch expansions could temper the pace of pure Bitcoin hashrate growth by diverting capital, potentially stabilizing or slightly improving hashprice as network supply increases slow.\n\nUnderstand these evolving market dynamics.

Fraudsters are now using artificial intelligence (AI) to put a new, sophisticated spin on age-old scams.

Now, AI can improve grammar, tone and intonation to make emails more convincing, as well as create convincing digital footprints and identities that can mimic the voices of people we know.    Common scams that leverage AI.  - Bank or government official impersonations: AI can create realistic audio or video clips (i.e., deepfakes and synthetic media)  - Social engineering: Fake phone calls, texts or emails have long been used to trick targets into sharing confidential data or sending funds to a fraudulent account.  - Extortion scams: AI can craft convincing phishing emails or texts that can mimic legitimate communications with trusted contacts.","gravity_id":"372934013","id":90543,"createdAt":"2026-01-17T06:00:05.316Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-17T06:00:05.316Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-17T05:56:38.024Z","text_content":"$BTC  Tested its Bull Market Support band for the first time since the breakdown in November.

My Simple Thoughts 📈\n\n\nHey everyone! I'm pretty new to crypto (and this account 😅), just a regular person trying to learn Bitcoin while the market does its thing. Been following BTC closely lately and wanted to share what I'm seeing—no fancy whale analysis, just observations + questions for you pros!\n\n\nCurrent vibe right now (Jan 17, 2026):\n\n\n1️⃣ BTC sitting around $95,000–$96,000 after dipping a bit from the recent push above $97K.\n\n\n2️⃣ Some wild swings this week—up nicely earlier, now consolidating.\n\n\n3️⃣ Spot Bitcoin ETFs had big inflows early January (over $1.7B in spots recently reported), which feels bullish after late-2025 outflows.\n\n\nQuick things catching my eye:\n🖇️ Breaking past old resistance levels → could test $100K again if momentum holds?\n\n\n⏳Analysts saying 2026 range might be $75K–$150K average, with some bulls calling $150K–$225K by year-end if institutions keep coming in.\n\n\n📈 But volatility is real—could pull back to $90K first.\n\n\nAs a beginner, I'm wondering:\n- Do you think we smash $100K this month or see a dip first?\n- What's the one thing you're watching right now (ETFs, macro news, charts)?\n- Any tips for newbies like me on when/how to enter during times like this? (Not financial advice—just curious!)\n\n\nWould love your thoughts—bullish, bearish, or somewhere in between?

After you read this post you will agree with me 100%. And this is good because you can show off with your friends telling them that you knew Bitcoin was going to crash months and months before the masses, specially when everything becomes euphoric next month.\n\nHere I will show you Bitcoin's long-term trajectory and then reinforce this with another post showing the monthly MACD.\n\nIn short, Bitcoin is now producing a relief rally, which means there will be a crash after a lower high.\n\nThe chart here shows Bitcoin monthly, thirty days, or one month, per candle.\n\nBack in April 2021, the market produced a Doji to signal the peak of the bull market. This was followed by three months of bearish action. Then comes a double-top and another Doji shows up November 2021.\n\nThe second high in November 2021 is followed by three months red and after the third month Bitcoin closes two consecutive months green. This was the relief rally in 2022. This happened in February and March.\n\nAfter the relief rally there was a bearish continuation, aka. a major crash, and I predicted this easily back in December 2021 with hundreds of publications. I also predicted the crash of all major altcoins and all the rest as well as the bull market that happened in 2025 and so on. This is all public. I am just saying this because people easily forget. It is impossible to fake the data coming from the charts.\n\nOk. Fast forward and bring yourself to this present moment.\n\nDecember 2024 Bitcoin produces the first Doji. This shows the bull market is reaching its end. The same process as 2021 repeats and we get a second high this time ending October 2025 when a second Doji appears. The second Doji is followed by three months red.\n\n\n\nNamaste.","gravity_id":"372933295","id":90573,"createdAt":"2026-01-17T06:20:07.976Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-17T06:20:07.976Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-17T06:10:39.865Z","text_content":"$BTC almost tapped 98K and is now consolidating above 94K.\n\nHere's what I expect:\n\nHold 94K -> 105K comes quick.\n\nHold 105K -> New ATHs.\n\nIt's that simple.\n\nI'll improve my giga longs if we close above 94K this week.\n\nFireworks soon! ✍️","gravity_id":"372934119","id":90574,"createdAt":"2026-01-17T06:20:08.269Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-17T06:20:08.269Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-17T06:25:45.111Z","text_content":"🐋 BlackRock has withdrawn 3,312 $BTC ($314.39M) and 5,336 $ETH ($17.54M) from #Coinbase in the past 10 hours.\n\n👉 This brings total withdrawals over the last 3 days to 12,658 #BTC ($1.21B) and 9,515 #ETH ($31.3M).\n\nIs this accumulation or preparation for something bigger? 🤔\n\nSource: @OnchainLens\n\n#BlackRock #Bitcoin #Ethereum #CryptoMarkets","gravity_id":"372933412","id":90580,"createdAt":"2026-01-17T06:30:03.350Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-17T06:40:07.387Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-17T06:28:34.328Z","text_content":"🚦 #Crypto Fear and Greed Index:\n\n🧭 Index Value : 50\n😱 Sentiment : Neutral 🟡\n💰 #BTC Price : $95,300\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Altcoin Season# #Meme Alpha#  $BTC","gravity_id":"372933438","id":90583,"createdAt":"2026-01-17T06:30:05.561Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-17T06:40:06.368Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-17T06:26:06.450Z","text_content":"Bitcoin’s price action has been on fire lately! $BTC  surged to two-month highs near $98K before consolidating around $96K.

From here, continuation will depend entirely on buyer strength and overall market sentiment.

However, it’s important to remember that one more CME gap still remains far below current price. Its fill would be highly undesirable and would likely signal a heavy market shakeout.

What the data shows - Short-term holders (STH) started cashing out gains - Spike in realized profits during the local rebound - Previously they were mostly in the red, now flipping to green  Analyst take: These profit-taking bursts often signal the current momentum is losing steam rather than kicking off a strong new leg up. It's more of a \"sell the rip\" reaction than fresh conviction buying.  Such patterns help spot potential exhaustion points in rallies.

However, price is still below the major supply band near $100k–$105K, which previously acted as a breakdown zone.

DeepBook provided the liquidity and dynamic order book management, ensuring seamless trading experiences. Walrus Protocol then layered on top, providing unmatched security, scalability, and decentralized governance.\nAfter months of development and testing, the Cipher Architects decided it was time to unveil their creation. They orchestrated a surprise launch event, where the entire community was invited to explore the platform at once. The response was overwhelming. Users marveled at the seamless integration of AI insights with high-speed trading and robust security.\nThe platform quickly became the talk of the town, attracting traders, developers, and investors from all corners of the globe. The fusion of IKA’s intelligence, DeepBook’s liquidity, and Walrus Protocol’s security set a new standard for DeFi.\nIn the end, the secret project became a legendary success, and Cipher Architects cemented their place as pioneers in the blockchain world.","gravity_id":"372954341","id":91222,"createdAt":"2026-01-17T15:00:06.164Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-17T15:00:06.164Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-17T14:53:56.699Z","text_content":"🇺🇸 Trump advisor: a Bitcoin reserve remains a U.S. priority\n\nPatrick Witt, Donald Trump’s crypto advisor, said that BTC accumulation is being carried out in “budget-neutral ways” — without costs for taxpayers.\n\nIn other words, the U.S. is not buying Bitcoin, but building a reserve from confiscated crypto.
