When the ratio drops below 0.995, it signals that short-term holders (STH) are selling at a loss. It’s often during these moments of STH capitulation that good opportunities emerge. For anyone implementing a DCA strategy, this indicator has proven to be particularly effective.  Some examples : August 2023 : BTC jumped from $26k to $70k. August 2024 : BTC surged from $54k to $100K . April 2025 : BTC climbed from $78,000 to $126,000.  🚨Today, it’s over.

A few European countries sent small, symbolic military teams to Greenland as a diplomatic gesture of support for Danish sovereignty. It wasn’t an act of aggression toward the United States, nor an economic move. It was political signaling — perhaps unnecessary, but peaceful in intent.\nTrump, however, chose to weaponize that gesture. Instead of responding through diplomacy, he retaliated with a 10% tariff against allies, framing them as adversaries for simply standing behind international norms. That reaction isn’t strength — it’s disproportionate and reckless.\nMarkets don’t panic over symbolism. They panic when world leaders turn symbolic politics into economic punishment. By targeting allies with tariffs over a diplomatic gesture, Trump is injecting instability into trade relations and trust within NATO itself.\nEurope’s move may have been clumsy. Trump’s response is destabilizing.

Why I trust Gold while Crypto is a game for Whales.\nToday, everyone is a \"crypto investor.\" People pour their last savings into Bitcoin, hoping for a miracle. But let’s use our brains and look at the facts. Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever he was, didn’t create a \"magic piggy bank.\" He created a tool for fast value transfer, bypassing the banks.\nThe Satoshi Mystery and the Voucher System\nWhy did Bitcoin’s creator vanish? Most likely, he understood: he was building a technology that breaks the banking monopoly on transfers. Bitcoin is essentially a digital voucher for moving funds globally. The creator himself pointed out that this is a payment system, not a long-term store of value.\nMany believe Satoshi is alive, waiting to cash out his 1 million coins. But the truth is, Bitcoin will grow only until people realize its true nature — the nature of a temporary voucher.\nCrypto is Pure Randomness\nDon’t be fooled: the crypto market is a massive game where whales eat \"hamsters.\" It’s wild risk. Today your tokens are worth millions; tomorrow they might vanish. Yes, you can speculate, but building your life's foundation on it is madness. Only enter crypto with money you are prepared to lose.\nThe Only Real Wealth — Gold\nFor centuries, gold has been the only true measure of wealth. Governments have offered paper, stocks, and bonds for years, blinding people with new \"saving\" methods. Why? So they can hoard the world’s gold while the masses collect paper.\nGold will always be the priority. It is the physical energy of the Earth. It cannot be \"printed\" or deleted from the network with one click.\nMy Advice:\nIf you want freedom — keep your country's fiat for living and Gold for your future. Use crypto as a tool for quick maneuvers, but don't turn it into an idol. Don't let the whales eat your resources. Be smarter. Be like Gold — eternal and calm.\nVionor Romanov.","gravity_id":"372960393","id":91703,"createdAt":"2026-01-17T21:10:07.842Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-17T21:10:07.842Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-17T21:16:51.088Z","text_content":"$BTC shaving the MC but maintaining a steady price, iykyk, bc that means momentum coming.","gravity_id":"372962250","id":91713,"createdAt":"2026-01-17T21:20:05.695Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-17T21:20:05.695Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-17T21:16:46.127Z","text_content":"West Virginia is emerging as a new point of $BTC   adoption, with growing political and institutional interest.

The comparison highlights Bitcoin's historical tendency to rebound strongly when sentiment and pricing diverge from long-term benchmarks.\n\nAs traders assess the current setup, many see the  $BTC &  $XAUt relationship as a key signal for potential upside. While market conditions remain volatile and influenced by broader economic factors, the growing focus on this valuation gap underscores Bitcoin's evolving role alongside traditional stores of value. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether this discount translates into another sustained rally.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Gold #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372959733","id":91753,"createdAt":"2026-01-17T22:00:05.148Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-17T22:30:08.008Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-17T21:57:15.488Z","text_content":"I’ve been revisiting $BTC on-chain and macro data, and the fundamentals still look solid to me.\nHash rate is hovering around 953 EH/s.

That scarcity factor is becoming more real each year, especially as institutional participation increases.\n\n\nWhat really caught my attention is capital movement. Roughly $130B flowed into $BTC in 2025, and with clearer regulations like the CLARITY Act, 2026 could easily see even stronger inflows.

Once you leave the matrix, you start seeing charts with different eyes—what you as a layman only sees as lines, I see as battles. The market has always been a war between bears and bulls; that’s the pure truth.  On one side, bulls fight selling pressure; on the other, bulls hold the selling zone. When the battle is being lost, they trigger stop losses just below to gather more allies and overcome selling pressure. Just wait—soon you'll understand the illustrated image.  Look at 2021: notice the X and just above it the 69. That X means sellers failed to push the price down to 15, which led to a victory at 69. Then in 2022, in the second wedge, another battle took place—but selling force took the entire lower part of the wedge, forcing buyers to retreat to 15.  Now fast forward to 2024: BTC at 107—once again, buying force won a tight battle, pushing BTC to 107 and continuing up to 126 in 2025.  Now in 2026, selling force has taken 100% of the wedge, practically wiping out buying power, resulting in the indicator pointing to BTC at 180 in 2026.  So here's the question: do you believe in news, or do you think big players can see this analysis and try to flip the game?

Here’s the breakdown:\n​🔹 The Bond Problem: Japan’s debt is over 200% of its GDP. As the government spends more on defense and pensions, bond interest rates are climbing, signaling high risk.\n​🔹 The Falling Yen: Because US interest rates are high and Japan’s are low, investors are ditching the Yen for the Dollar. 💵\n​🔹 The Stock Market Paradox: 1. Export Boost: A weak Yen makes Japanese exports cheaper and more profitable in Dollar terms.\n2. Asset Shift: Investors are moving money out of risky bonds and into stocks.\n3.

Mining companies such as IREN and Applied Digital partially shifted their focus toward AI infrastructure and high-performance computing (HPC).  As a result, they rode the broader tech rally. AI chipmaker Nvidia, for example, reached a record valuation of more than $5.1 trillion in 2025. That enthusiasm spilled over into the valuations of companies that deploy their data centers for AI-related services, giving mining stocks an extra boost beyond Bitcoin itself.  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372969203","id":92110,"createdAt":"2026-01-18T07:20:05.774Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-18T07:40:07.538Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-18T07:15:44.770Z","text_content":"$BTC  \r \r As long as price holds above the neckline, the structure remains bullish.\r No breakdown yet, momentum still favors the upside.","gravity_id":"372970002","id":92111,"createdAt":"2026-01-18T07:20:06.380Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-18T07:30:07.657Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-18T07:15:25.607Z","text_content":"If you’re checking the chart every 5 minutes,\n\nYou’re not trading,\n\n You’re emotionally gambling.\n\n $BTC","gravity_id":"372970001","id":92112,"createdAt":"2026-01-18T07:20:06.709Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-18T07:30:07.870Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-18T07:14:40.023Z","text_content":"China's playing with its digital monopoly money.

If ETH/BTC keeps climbing, altcoins could slowly regain relevance - even without a full risk-on environment.\nWatch relative strength, not headlines.\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Ethereum #BTC","gravity_id":"372970538","id":92185,"createdAt":"2026-01-18T08:40:06.412Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-18T08:50:06.318Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-18T08:31:00.083Z","text_content":"🇲🇩 Moldova is setting the rules for crypto in 2026  Moldova is preparing a $BTC  regulation framework to be rolled out in 2026, largely aligned with the EU’s MiCA model.

The battle isn't \"bull vs. bear\"—it's Absorption vs. Resistance. Here is the expert breakdown of why $101.5K is the only number that matters right now. 👇  1️⃣ THE CEILING: $101.5K \"Red Line\" 🧱 Bitcoin is compressed. The Weekly 21 SMA acts as a rigid lid on price at $101.5K. • The Threat: Rejection here risks a \"Death Cross\" (21 SMA crossing below 50 SMA). • The Reality: Until we close a weekly candle above $101.5K, the trend remains technically bearish. This is \"No Man's Land.\"  2️⃣ THE TRAP: $99.4K Breakeven 📉 Why the struggle to break out? Look at the STH Realized Price. • Data: The average cost basis for recent buyers (Short-Term Holders) is $99.4K. • Psychology: \"Underwater\" traders sell here to break even, creating a dense supply wall.  3️⃣ THE SILENT BULL: Whales Accumulate 🐳 While retail panics, the \"Smart Money\" supply side has gone silent. • Miners: Post-halving capitulation is over. Miner balances are increasing. They aren't selling; they are hoarding. • HODLers: Selling pressure (CDD) has flatlined. There is almost no liquid supply below $95K.  🧠 TITANIUM STRATEGY Price is weak, but On-Chain fundamentals are screaming accumulation. The market is waiting to clear the $99.4K - $101.5K zone. • The Play: Aggressive longs are premature until the $101.5K reclaim is confirmed. • Optimal: Range Accumulation.

The 92K to 93K offers the most attractive level because of the alignment of the trend line and a previous key support (order block). While a swing trade long opportunity may confirm sooner, this scenario is the lower risk, higher probability scenario worth waiting for. In fact, I just shared an Ethereum trade setup that has a very similar configuration relative to the 3K level.\n\nThis chart is show the 4 hour time frame, ideal for shorter time horizon swing trades which can have a duration of a couple of hours up to a few days or even a week. Risk can be specifically defined by the key support levels like 90K and 92K. The ideal situation is to WAIT for price tot confirm before putting on a position. You can see the expected outcome on this chart which can reasonably test the 100K level upon the next leg higher.\n\nSome key considerations as to why this scenario is more likely over the next week or two. Technical argument still favors a broader BULLISH trend. There was some questioning when 88K was briefly compromised, but price spent VERY little time below that key Wave 1/4 over lap which is something I have been pointing out for months. The current broader wave count favors the possibility Bitcoin is in a bullish wave 5 of the broader 5th which in simple language means the 126K high is within reason to be tested over the first quarter. This is NOT an absolute conclusion, it is what the current price structure implies.\n\nFundamentals must drive the move IF it is going to move.

Most probable scenario: As long as BTC holds above 94K on a weekly basis, price is likely to continue rotating toward the upper range at 97–98K. A weekly close above 98K would signal a constructive shift toward the 100–102K resistance zone.  Alternatives: A loss of 93.5K would keep BTC locked in range rotation, opening downside back toward 91–92K, with 88–90K acting as the next high-volume support if pressure builds.

For context, the global crypto market dropped 7.85% in 2025, marking the first annual decline since 2022.   \r \r However, most of these losses emerged in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the year recording periods of price surges across multiple months. When the market saw bullish momentum, these Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) firms deployed capital, but the trend slowed in Q4.   \r \r CoinGecko’s report shows that crypto failed to carry its earlier momentum into 2025. The total market value dropped nearly 8% year-over-year and ended the year near $3 trillion.   \r \r The sharpest damage came in the last three months of the year, when the market shed almost a quarter of its value. Notably, a liquidation wave of roughly $19 billion in October accelerated the drop shortly after total market value briefly reached a record high near $4.4 trillion.    \r \r While gold and silver saw gains, Bitcoin could not keep up, dropping more than 6% last year. However, digital asset treasury companies stole the show.    \r \r These firms spent at least $49.7 billion buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other tokens during the year. Nearly half of the spending came in the third quarter, when several new treasury vehicles launched and immediately deployed heavy capital into the market.   \r \r Their activity helped push institutional ownership to a new scale, giving treasuries control of more than 5% of both the Bitcoin and Ethereum supply by year-end.
