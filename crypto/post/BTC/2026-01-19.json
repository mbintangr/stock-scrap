Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, says in her 2026 Outlook that Bitcoin’s fixed supply gives it a major advantage as institutional demand continues to grow.  In 2025, gold performed strongly, rising about 65%, while Bitcoin dipped slightly. However, Wood explains that gold supply can increase when prices rise because miners can produce more. Bitcoin is different its supply is mathematically capped and cannot be increased.  Over the next two years, Bitcoin’s supply will grow by only about 0.82% per year, and that rate will slow even more over time.

The American fast-food chain has purchased $10 million in Bitcoin, turning everyday burger sales into a growing corporate treasury. With $BTC  integrated into payments, marketing, and even payroll, management says the strategy helped drive double-digit same-store sales growth in 2025 - outperforming the broader restaurant industry.  Notably, the company rejected adding Ethereum as a payment option, despite a poll showing majority support. Leadership chose focus over flexibility, leaning into a clear Bitcoin-first identity rather than supporting $ETH  alongside it. From customer payments to employee wages, Steak ’n Shake is betting that a tightly aligned crypto strategy - not experimentation - is how a legacy brand stays relevant in a digital-first economy.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #ETH   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372988582","id":93095,"createdAt":"2026-01-18T21:50:03.478Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-18T22:10:08.096Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-18T21:48:38.911Z","text_content":"$BTC idc if its fake.

Every pump was met with folded arms and narrowed eyes; every dip with buyers afraid it was a trap. Traders remembered too many fake breakouts, too many leveraged cascades. Volume thinned, volatility compressed, and Bitcoin became a coin of hesitation. No one wanted to be first. No one trusted the move. The king of crypto wasn’t falling—but it wasn’t leading either.\nThat pause created a vacuum.\nWhile Bitcoin slept, attention began to leak elsewhere, quietly at first. Builders, not speculators, followed the signal. On Sui, transactions were fast, cheap, and constant. Apps didn’t stall waiting for sentiment—they shipped. Liquidity found DeepBook, data flowed through Walrus, and new protocols stitched together trading, storage, and execution in ways that felt smooth instead of fragile. There was no single candle, no obvious “pump.” Just steady usage, wallets lighting up, and charts that climbed without shouting.\nCapital rotated the way it always does when belief returns—but this time it wasn’t chasing memes. It chased ecosystems that worked. Sui-native tokens began to trend not because Bitcoin told them to, but because users stayed. Yield came from activity, not leverage. NFTs plugged into DeFi. Games fed liquidity. Infrastructure rewarded patience.\nAltcoin season didn’t explode. It emerged.\nBitcoin remained the anchor, trading sideways, watching. And in that stillness, Sui ran ahead—not as a rebellion, but as a preview. When trust finally returned to Bitcoin, the market realized something had already changed: the next cycle had been built while no one was looking.","gravity_id":"372992374","id":93184,"createdAt":"2026-01-18T23:40:06.095Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-18T23:40:06.095Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-18T23:33:11.829Z","text_content":"$BTC a little dump dont panic !","gravity_id":"372993189","id":93185,"createdAt":"2026-01-18T23:40:06.403Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-18T23:40:06.403Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-18T23:49:11.190Z","text_content":"📊 JUST IN : #Bitcoin  hits $94,000    #crypto   BTC  $BTC","gravity_id":"372993299","id":93193,"createdAt":"2026-01-18T23:50:05.929Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-18T23:50:05.929Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-18T23:48:32.942Z","text_content":"It's the beginning of a new week, I checked the charts and saw $BTC falling.

The recent selloff looks more like momentum cooling than a structural breakdown, especially given the strong impulse move that preceded it.\nFrom a market structure perspective, BTC put in a clear higher high near $97.8k following an expansion from the $89k base. Since then, price has transitioned into consolidation and short-term distribution, with sellers pressing price back toward the prior breakout zone.\nThe $92k–$93k region now stands out as the first key demand area. This zone aligns with the previous consolidation range and should act as a decision point. Holding above it keeps the broader bullish structure intact and opens the door for range continuation or another attempt higher after consolidation. A clean loss of this level would likely invite a deeper retrace toward the high-$80k to low-$90k area, where stronger demand previously stepped in.\nMomentum indicators are resetting after being stretched, which is typical after a sharp upside leg. This favors sideways action or controlled pullbacks rather than immediate continuation. As long as BTC holds above the prior range lows, dips still look corrective rather than trend-ending.","gravity_id":"373003729","id":94002,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T09:30:06.187Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T09:30:06.187Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-19T09:22:45.056Z","text_content":"Market Dynamics: Precious Metals Rise While Bitcoin Falls https://ift.tt/beUaW27","gravity_id":"373002880","id":94003,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T09:30:06.530Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T09:30:06.530Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-19T09:22:45.054Z","text_content":"🚨 $875 Millions have been liquidated in the past 24 hours as Bitcoin fell below $92,000.\n\nThe largest single liquidation order happened on @HyperliquidX - $BTC-USDT value $25.83M.

Most probable scenario: A range-bound consolidation between 90–94.5k, allowing momentum and positioning to reset. Reclaiming 94.5k on improving volume would signal acceptance back into the prior range.  Alternatives: Failure to hold 91–90k opens room for a deeper liquidity test toward 88–89k. Conversely, a clean reclaim of 95k would invalidate the pullback and shift bias back toward upside continuation.  Net take: Controlled correction, not capitulation.

If we broke the lower one (the green zone), we would drop to $90,000 — and that’s exactly what happened.  Now we’re watching the trendline. If it fails to hold and we see a clear break, I think we’ll quickly move down to the low $80K area.  Don’t forget, Bitcoin is still moving within a bearish technical pattern — a falling flag — which points to further downside. That’s why you should buy in parts and обязательно keep some funds for a potential move to $80,000 and below to add more to your position. That’s exactly what I did. So if we go up — I profit. If we go down — I buy more and profit later with a larger gain. Either way works for me.  ETH also rejected from its resistance zone (the white one). However, it can still move higher — we’re watching that zone closely, it needs to be broken. I’ll break down Ethereum in detail in the next post.

The moves we’re seeing right now are hard to ignore. Price has been breaking into fresh territory, and the structure has been surprisingly clean compared to what we’ve had in other markets.  One thing that’s made this transition easier is keeping everything in one place. Instead of juggling multiple platforms, I can move from crypto positions like $BTC   straight into Gold using the same balance. No transfers, no downtime, no relearning a new system every time I want exposure to a different market.  What I like most is the efficiency. Execution feels familiar, leverage is there when I need it, and I’m not wasting energy switching between apps just to catch a move. At this stage, I’m less interested in complexity and more focused on positioning myself where the momentum actually is whatever form that takes. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373007186","id":94350,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T12:40:07.895Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T12:40:07.895Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-19T12:32:53.235Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $BTC","gravity_id":"373006318","id":94351,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T12:40:08.217Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T12:40:08.217Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-19T12:32:36.421Z","text_content":"2026 isn’t shaping up like a hype-driven bull run.\nIt’s shaping up like a positioning year.\n\nBitcoin is behaving less like a speculative asset and more like a macro hedge.

The market just got a cold reminder that while Michael Saylor is buying, the Old Guard of Bitcoin is finally cashing their chips.  ​After a weekend of teasing the $98k mark, Bitcoin just took a sharp dive back toward $92,500, triggered by a massive $4 billion coordinated dump from long-dormant whale wallets. The on-chain data is startling: over 22,000 $BTC  hit exchanges in a single hour this morning. It’s a collision between the new institutional money and Satoshi-era OGs who are deciding that $100k is close enough to start taking generational profits. If we can’t hold the $92k support line, that liquidity magnet at $90k is going to pull us down fast.  ​Honestly, the path forward is a total tug-of-war. On one side, you have the Trump Trade cooling off as new tariff threats against the EU reignite macro fears. On the other, you have the Fish-to-Shark cohort (holders with 10–1,000 BTC) currently undergoing their strongest accumulation phase since the 2022 FTX collapse.   We are essentially watching the greatest transfer of wealth in crypto history: the original pioneers are exiting to the new Wall Street elite.

In 2026,  $BTC liquidity is concentrated on a small group of large centralized exchanges where deep order books, tight spreads, and consistent execution allow traders to enter and exit positions efficiently. Strong Bitcoin liquidity reduces slippage on large orders, improves risk management, and ensures more stable pricing during periods of high volatility.\n\nHow to Evaluate Liquidity for Bitcoin Trading\n\nFor Bitcoin traders, liquidity goes beyond reported trading volume. Key indicators include order book depth within 1–2% of the mid-price, which determines how easily large BTC orders can be filled without moving the market. Spread stability during sharp price movements is another critical signal, as reliable BTC liquidity should remain tight even during news-driven volatility. Since derivatives now dominate BTC trading activity, exchanges with deep BTC perpetual futures markets often lead price discovery, while spot BTC markets remain essential for ownership, settlement, and long-term positioning.\n\nMost Liquid Exchanges for Bitcoin Trading in 2026\n\nBitcoin liquidity in 2026 is centered on a handful of major exchanges. #Binance  continues to provide some of the deepest BTC liquidity across both spot and derivatives markets, supporting large-scale execution. #Bitget  and #ByBit t show strong BTC perpetual futures depth, making them attractive for active and leveraged BTC strategies. Coinbase and Kraken offer stable liquidity in fiat-based BTC pairs such as BTC/USD, favored by institutional and long-term participants. #kucoin and #MEXC  contribute additional BTC liquidity, though depth and execution quality can vary depending on market conditions.

Around $870M in total liquidations were reported, mostly longs, which explains why the move felt so sharp 😅  So can BTC reclaim 97K or do we sink to 90K?  How we would get back to 97K: • BTC needs to reclaim the mid 90Ks first and actually hold it, not just wick it • 97K has been a hard ceiling recently, so a clean break needs real spot buying and lower leverage, otherwise it is just another pop that fades • Watch if open interest cools while price rises, that is healthier  How we end up at 90K: • If BTC keeps failing below 95K and bounces look weak, sellers stay in control • 92K-ish is the first “line in the sand” support area. If that breaks, 90K becomes the obvious magnet and it can get ugly fast because stops stack there  My take: this move looks more like a leverage flush plus big supply hitting the book, not the start of a new bear market.

On one side you’ve got that “4B whale dump” headline spooking everyone, plus rising exchange inflows which usually means more coins are getting positioned to sell. On the other side, buyers have been defending key levels fast enough to stop a full cascade, which is why the drop has looked more like pressure than panic  So what matters for the next move?  If $BTC  price can get back above 97K and stay there for more than a quick wick, it tells you the sell wall got absorbed and late shorts are fuel. That’s when 97K turns from “ceiling” into “floor” and momentum traders chase higher.  If it can’t reclaim 97K cleanly, the path of least resistance is a grind back toward 90K, because that’s where bids tend to stack and where the market will check if demand is real or just dip-buyers.  My read: whales selling doesn’t automatically mean collapse. It means the market needs proof. Reclaim 97K with follow through, bulls take the wheel.

This sell-off aligns with the lower highs and lower lows visible on the 1H chart, confirming bearish market control.\nFrom a technical perspective, price is currently trading below the descending trendline, and the recent impulsive drop suggests weak demand. The market is now expected to make a pullback toward the trendline and the POI (bearish order block). This area acts as premium pricing where sellers are likely to re-enter.\nIf price respects the trendline and order block, the higher-probability scenario is a bearish continuation, with BTC targeting the inducement liquidity zone around 90K or slightly below. This level represents resting liquidity and unfinished business from prior consolidation.\nA reclaim of 97K would only be valid if price breaks and holds above the trendline with strong displacement, which currently looks unlikely given momentum and volume behavior.\nConclusion:\nBias remains bearish. Expect a retracement into resistance (trendline + order block) followed by a continuation move toward 90K or lower, unless market structure decisively shifts. \n\n#BTC #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373013423","id":94678,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T15:30:05.856Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T15:30:05.856Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-19T15:25:45.076Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nWintermute: Cryptocurrency Market Breaks Free from Downtrend with ETF Expansion, Top Assets Lead the Way in Driving Retail Focus\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"373014228","id":94679,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T15:30:06.184Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T15:30:06.184Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-19T15:25:45.076Z","text_content":"Tether partners with Bitqik to boost crypto literacy in Laos, educating 10,000+ people on Bitcoin and $USDT use cases via events and online programs in 2026.

Behind the noise, the market has shifted from speculative mania to a more stable, institutional-led accumulation phase. Investors are clearly treating  $BTC as a strategic asset rather than a quick trade.\nThe most obvious bullish signal comes from spot Bitcoin ETFs. Between January 12–18, 2026, U.S. ETFs recorded massive inflows, with around $1.2 billion entering in just two days. This flood of regulated capital is creating a “liquidity floor” near $90,000, showing that institutions are actively supporting the market.\nAs of January 19th, Bitcoin has finally broken a multi-month downtrend, rising above $94,820 for the first time since mid-November 2025. This structural breakout is turning $95,000 from a psychological ceiling into solid support, setting the stage for a move toward the $100,000 resistance level.\nOn-chain data also supports the bullish case. Supply-side scarcity is becoming apparent, with limited circulating  $BTC meeting growing institutional demand. Even the recent $864 million in liquidations mainly cleared over-leveraged long positions, which strengthens the market by removing weak hands and letting genuine buyers take control.\nLooking ahead, maintaining a daily close above $95,000 is key. Short-term dips near the $91,000 CME gap are seen as buy-the-dip opportunities, while the macro trend remains bullish. With the 50-day moving average around $90,030 and institutional momentum building, #Bitcoin is well-positioned to target the $150,000 range by late 2026.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights# #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"373015462","id":94753,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T16:10:07.791Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T16:10:07.791Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-19T16:02:09.337Z","text_content":"The #Bitcoin  Crash Everyone's Waiting For May Never Come  S2F Reversion remains above 1 but below historical cycle extremes.

Yeah, whales did unload nearly 4$ BILLION worth of $BTC  in under an hour, and that triggered over $500M in long liquidations  but this isn’t a simple crash headline. It’s a make-or-break moment for Bitcoin’s next big move.   Here’s the real tea: 👇  📉 Bearish Pressure Isn’t Just FUD Quick whale sell-offs wiped out liquidity and erased huge market cap momentum, forcing short-term traders to liquidate. That’s why BTC dipped and failed to hold the $94K+ zone.   🔥 BUT WAIT There’s Hidden Bullish Fuel Too Not all whales are selling. Some large holders are actually accumulating, leading to exchange supply hitting multi-year lows  which historically precedes big upmoves.   📊 So Let’s Talk Scenarios:  🚀 Bull Case $BTC  Reclaims $97K ✔ Buyers defend key support at $90K ✔ Short liquidations reverse into aggressive buys ✔ Whales shift from selling to stacking again  This would trap shorts and ignite a short-squeeze rally that could rocket BTC back toward $97K.   📉 Bear Case BTC Slips Toward $90K        .Continued whale selling pressure      .Weak demand from ETFs & institutions      .Technical resistance at $94K–$95K holds  If that happens, we break down to $90K or even lower before finding real support.   🤔 My Take: This isn’t a simple dump. It’s a battle between weak hands dumping & smart money accumulating.
