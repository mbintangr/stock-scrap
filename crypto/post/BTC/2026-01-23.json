Why this is Bullish: Less Supply: When one group holds $63 Billion worth of Bitcoin and refuses to sell, it makes the coins left on the market much harder to find.  No Selling Pressure: Because they have so much profit, they don't need to sell. In fact, they plan to buy even more.

Read in full...\n\nBitcoin is very slow lately and the same price range has been holding for months, no change truly. Normally, even while we recognize all of the signals and keep a bullish bias, it is still normal to wonder if Bitcoin will continue growing.\n\nThe active price range is the same since late November. Bitcoin has been moving between $84,000 to $92,000.\n\nNow, think of this. Do you remember after the higher low 18-December how sellers couldn't produce a price below $86,000?\n\nRegardless of all the fluctuations and the sideways range, the lowest possible was $86,400, never below, and this development is still true today.\n\nThe lowest Bitcoin has gone was $87,277, yesterday, and you can see how easily this is the final low. Last month it was $86,400, 24-Dec, this month it is ~$87,000.\n\nWe have a trading range but still, there is a clear and undeniable bullish bias. The most recent move is a higher high that peaked at a perfect level based on Fibonacci retracement; all the action is composed of higher highs and higher lows.\n\nSo, we have a bullish consolidation period, we can even say an uptrend if we consider only the short-term. This will lead to a higher high next.\n\nThe last target at $98,000 matches the 0.382 Fib. retracement level (inverted correction) on this chart. The next target is 0.618 which sits around $108,800... And that's all I have to say.\n\nWhile the doubt is in the air, it is not in the chart. Trust the chart and all will be good.\n\nThe truth is that the next move has already being revealed.

This causes you to flip back and forth on your narrative based on the hype of the week or month, which is usually designed to confuse people and manipulate markets. Do not get me wrong. Catalysts do need to be monitored. But calling every piece of data important all the time is just nonsense. It creates the noise Wall Street is after.\n\nThe key takeaway is to have a backbone you can comfortably stand on. Build a thesis off more than just a micro perspective and news narratives. Use historical analysis backed by data. Then make a decision. You will see all the volatility is just noise based off money flow and expectations.\n\nThis usually creates a predictable market that sticks to a median, ranging either higher or lower based on short term expectations, while the long term direction is driven by historical data or catalysts. \n\nKnowing the difference is key to keeping you sane. It forces you to rethink your thesis only if the historical data changes or a catalyst occurs. Navigating short term volatility involves understanding expectations. You simply change your short term perspective based on charting and trends. The charts show you where price expectations are, not trying to guess how much every news story will move the price. \n\nThis is how you navigate uncertainty. You do not change your mind all the time. You learn what drives price historically, which allows you to distinguish between a catalyst and a narrative used to confuse inexperienced traders.\n $BTC","gravity_id":"373112514","id":101829,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T20:20:06.666Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T20:20:06.666Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-22T20:17:19.567Z","text_content":"$BTC Long 10","gravity_id":"373113408","id":101830,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T20:20:07.036Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T20:20:07.036Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-22T20:16:45.030Z","text_content":"Another US State Announces Plans to Create a Strategic Reserve of Bitcoin and Altcoins\nhttps://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/another-us-state-announces-plans-to-create-a-strategic-reserve-of-bitcoin-and-altcoins/?feed_id=62649&_unique_id=697284a0c19a2","gravity_id":"373111491","id":101831,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T20:20:07.416Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T20:20:07.416Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-22T20:16:09.786Z","text_content":"Trump suing JP Morgan? 😂 Maybe he shoulda just bought $BTC .

When volatility spikes or macro news hits, capital does not disappear. It rotates. That is why I started paying attention to Bitget TradFi and the RWA futures feature.  From my experience, Bitget TradFi lets me trade traditional assets like gold, major indices and forex pairs directly alongside crypto using the same account balance. I do not need to move funds to a separate broker or wait days for settlement. I can shift risk quickly when market conditions change, which matters a lot during macro driven weeks.  Gold and indices are especially useful for crypto traders. When risk sentiment turns negative, $BTC  and alts often pull back while gold $XAUt  or certain indices hold value or move in the opposite direction. Being able to hedge or rotate into those markets helps smooth out equity swings instead of sitting fully exposed to crypto volatility.  What I like most is how this fits into a broader market view. When liquidity leaves crypto, I can follow it into metals or indices without changing platforms. When risk appetite returns, I rotate back. It feels more like managing a portfolio instead of just trading one asset class.  Execution and pricing have been consistent for me, and having everything under one interface makes decision making faster. For traders who already think in terms of macro cycles and capital flow, this kind of TradFi access makes sense.

Pepeto represents a higher-risk, early-cycle bet before broader price discovery.\n\n\nCurious how others here think about balancing established assets like BTC versus early-stage opportunities. #Bitcoin #BTC #CryptoAnalysis","gravity_id":"373111632","id":101879,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T20:50:06.337Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T21:00:08.737Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-22T20:46:45.157Z","text_content":"Nomura's Laser Digital Launches Tokenized Bitcoin Yield Fund for Accredited Investors\nLaser Digital debuts BDYF, a tokenized Bitcoin fund merging core BTC holdings with yield strategies via arbitrage, lending, and options for institutional investors. \nhttps://www.coinspeaker.com/nomura-laser-digital-bitcoin-yield-fund-bdyf/?fsp_sid=6011 ","gravity_id":"373112646","id":101880,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T20:50:06.741Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T21:00:09.117Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-22T20:46:45.154Z","text_content":"According to traders participating on Kalshi,\nthe probability that $BTC will break above $100,000 again by June 2026 is estimated at 64%.\n\nRather than short-term price moves, a longer-term, time-horizon-based view is gradually gaining traction.

Not fear bait. The global setup is turning extremely fragile. Every major tariff event since early 2025 has triggered the same outcome. February dump. October dump. January dump. Even the Supreme Court decision will not change the trajectory because tariffs approved or cancelled both lead to the same reaction. Confidence breaks and liquidity tightens.  We have now entered the pressure loop where headlines are released while markets are closed. Fear builds with no liquidity to absorb it. Once futures reopen the emotional flush normally arrives because traders react to days of tension in the span of minutes. Shortly after the initial shock investors remember tariffs are scheduled weeks out so panic cools but stress remains. Midweek buyers return because there is still room for negotiation and the narrative of progress appears again. This creates the illusion of stability until officials begin teasing trade talks which eventually leads to a headline that pushes markets up again. The same cycle has repeated many times since 2025 and big institutions continue capturing the flow while retail gets trapped.  This is how the largest wealth transfer forms. The system feeds on volatility and most participants do not understand they are being played inside a predictable psychological loop. With uncertainty rising across global indices and major regions showing synchronized drawdowns the risk is reaching a critical point.  If you hold any asset especially $BTC  be extremely careful with leverage. #Bitcoin  reacts faster and harder to funding stress and tariff shocks often spill directly into crypto liquidity.

The Digital Gold vs. Physical Gold debate just reached a fever pitch. With Gold smashing historical records to soar above $4,900 per ounce - the gap between the 2 premier stores of value has widened significantly.

Something far removed from regular trading - especially when it comes to assets like $BTC . What’s interesting is that this view isn’t rare even now. Around 70% of crypto users, especially beginners, think the same way.  At first glance, this belief seems harmless. But in reality, it creates a real barrier: many traders - both new and experienced - never even try market making.   I decided to dig deeper and understood why this myth exists. Turns out, there are many platforms offering market making programs. But most of them simply don’t work for small traders.  Fortunately, there are different approaches. The WhiteBIT Market Making Program is a good example of how market making can work for smaller/ middle sized traders.  Here’s what makes the difference: 🔹 $2.7T in annual trading volume, providing deep and stable liquidity, $50B+ capitalization 🔹 Spot trading fees with rebates up to –0.012%, even without massive volumes 🔹 800+ trading pairs and access to a market of 35M+ users, and 24/7 support  The result: traders with limited capital can use market making as a real tool for generating profit - not just something reserved for whales and institutions.  👉 Join the WhiteBIT MM program and start profiting, no matter your trading volume. https://institutional.whitebit.com/market-making-program?utm_source=coinmarketcap&utm_medium=market_M1&utm_campaign=post   #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373114515","id":102032,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T22:50:08.277Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T22:50:08.277Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-22T22:58:45.033Z","text_content":"When the Treasury decides to HODL seized $BTC 🤣.

This aligns perfectly with the historical data, but it suggests the move might not be over yet. ​3️⃣ The Next Danger Zone: If this recurring cycle holds true, the next key area for a potential negative reaction is January 28th. ​My Strategy: I don’t trade feelings; I trade recurring patterns.

Once BTC reclaimed the 45 RSI level, the bull market started. From that point on, the cycle followed a clear rhythm: Impulse up → consolidation → trend reversal → continuation  This exact sequence played out three times during this cycle: - A strong impulsive move higher - A long consolidation phase - RSI cooling off back toward the 45 level - A clean retest of 45 as support → followed by a powerful expansion to new highs  Those long consolidations weren’t weakness. They were preparation for more upside.  Now comes the important part.  Recently, BTC was setting up to repeat this pattern for a fourth time. Momentum slowed, consolidation expanded. But this time, RSI failed to hold 45.  Instead of acting as support, the 45 level is now acting as resistance.  That’s a structural shift.  If Bitcoin wants to postpone a deeper bear phase, the condition is simple: → RSI must reclaim 45 and hold it again  Until that happens, the rhythm that defined this entire cycle is broken.

What may happen next: If support holds with volume, we could see a quick 10–15% relief pump toward $3.70–$3.80 as shorts cover and buyers pile in on the dip. But if it cracks below $3.34 convincingly, expect a flush toward $3.20–$3.30 in a deeper correction before any real bottom forms. High-conviction range, these often resolve fast once direction clears. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  $BTC  #Meme Alpha#","gravity_id":"373118401","id":102141,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T00:40:06.780Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T00:50:08.642Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T00:31:55.618Z","text_content":"🗣 ARK Invest: The Bitcoin and crypto market could reach $28T by 2030.

The product represents a departure from traditional single-asset crypto funds by blending digital and physical stores of value.   Trading under ticker BPRO on the New York Stock Exchange, the Bitwise Proficio Currency Debasement ETF requires that at least one-quarter of its portfolio remain in gold holdings. The fund charges investors 0.96% annually and allows managers to adjust allocations between crypto and commodity-backed #assets  based on market conditions.   Proficio Capital Partners chief investment officer Bob Haber pointed to Goldman Sachs data that shows gold-backed exchange-traded products make up less than 1% of individual investor portfolios. He characterized gold as largely absent from contemporary investment strategies despite decades of performance history.   The fund's positioning emphasizes protecting existing wealth rather than generating outsized returns. This approach reflects broader changes in how #institutional  investors frame cryptocurrency investments as digital assets mature beyond speculative trading tools.   Currency debasement concerns have driven interest in $BTC  since its creation, with proponents arguing the asset's fixed supply makes it resistant to #inflation . Recent market data complicates this narrative, as #Bitcoin  has lagged behind gold performance in comparable timeframes.   Karel Mercx, an analyst at Netherlands-based investment advisory Beleggers Belangen, published research questioning Bitcoin's reliability as a debasement hedge. His analysis highlighted Bitcoin's failure to rally when President Donald Trump criticized Federal Reserve independence, a development that typically benefits alternative stores of value.","gravity_id":"373119373","id":102174,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T01:20:08.174Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T01:20:08.174Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T01:29:33.951Z","text_content":"On-Chain Data Reveals Major Liquidation Cluster Overhead\r \r After a significant price drop, the market is in a consolidation phase.

ARK thinks the next cycle is much bigger than most expect. Their base case sees crypto growing into a $28T asset class by 2030 - and while $BTC  leads the story, the drivers go far beyond price alone.  Bitcoin still sets the pace. ARK estimates BTC could make up ~70% of that total market, helped by rising ETF exposure and corporate holdings. Institutional players already grew their share of $BTC   supply from 8.7% to 12% in 2025 - a quiet but meaningful shift.  Here’s what’s building underneath 👇 • Crypto market growing at a 61% CAGR toward $28T • Bitcoin supply tightening as adoption expands • DeFi, stablecoins, and tokenized RWAs scaling fast  Smart contract platforms are part of the equation too, with ARK projecting them toward $6T by 2030. The takeaway isn’t price targets - it’s structure. Capital, infrastructure, and use cases are lining up at the same time.  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373120694","id":102273,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T03:50:06.216Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T04:00:08.025Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T03:46:57.818Z","text_content":"The evolution of RWA Inc is here. \n\nWe are shifting focus from simple launches to a comprehensive infrastructure stack built for professional investors and asset managers.\n\nWe are moving beyond standard launchpad services to offer curated private market opportunities.\n\nOur new focus: \n🔹 Institutional-grade platform for compliant issuance \n🔹 Real World Assets: Pre-IPO equity, real estate, & collectibles \n🔹 Rigorous due diligence: Real world asset classes with large asset managers behind the assets\n\nReal World Assets, On-Chain.\n\n $BTC","gravity_id":"373120688","id":102274,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T03:50:06.635Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T04:00:08.416Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T03:46:45.064Z","text_content":"Daily News 🗞 | January 23\n\n• $18B asset manager F/m seeks SEC approval to tokenize US Treasury ETF\n\n• Nomura’s Laser Digital rolls out yield-bearing Bitcoin fund\n\n• Crypto market could reach $28T by 2030 on Bitcoin, DeFi and tokenization\n\n• Thailand plans crypto ETF rules as institutional interest increases\n\n• Vietnam opens licensing window for digital asset trading platforms\n\n#CryptoNews #PoloniexNEWS","gravity_id":"373120687","id":102275,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T03:50:07.021Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T04:00:08.642Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T03:46:45.041Z","text_content":"🔍 Bitcoin slipped below $90,000 as Asian stocks edged higher after the Bank of Japan held rates, with markets weighing softer US tariff talk.\n\n#CryptoMarket #AsiaMarketOpen \nhttps://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-wall-street-rebound-lifts-asia-risk-mood-asia-market-open/?feed_id=26317&_unique_id=6972ec75a1062","gravity_id":"373121385","id":102276,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T03:50:07.406Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T04:00:08.943Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T03:44:30.742Z","text_content":"JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Kansas introduces Bitcoin Strategic Reserve bill.

On the 4H chart, $BTC  remains in a short-term downtrend since the mid-month peak, trading below the EMA ribbon and hovering near the lower Bollinger Band around 88,800–89,000 USDT. Recent price action shows small-bodied candles and reduced volume, indicating selling pressure is cooling and buyers are cautiously defending support.  The structure stays bearish with lower highs intact, while Bollinger Bands begin to narrow — suggesting reduced volatility and a potential consolidation or squeeze setup.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is clear: lawmakers shouldn’t wait for a “perfect” crypto bill. Clear, workable rules matter more than ideal ones. Without a framework, uncertainty grows, innovation slows, and capital hesitates to deploy at scale. This concern is echoing inside Washington. Patrick Witt recently warned that crypto won’t remain in a legal gray zone forever — a market structure bill is coming. The real risk is timing. If regulation only arrives after the next financial crisis, history suggests it will be written in panic, not precision — and that rarely favors innovation, builders, or even markets like $BTC . Bottom line: proactive regulation sets guardrails and confidence. Reactive regulation sets restrictions.

In theory, this should open the door for Bitcoin to move toward higher price levels.  Selling pressure on Bitcoin declines sharply While Bitcoin’s price action has not yet met the expectations of many investors, several encouraging developments are visible on the blockchain. In 2024 and 2025, many “old coins” came back into circulation and were sold, similar to what was observed at the bull market peaks of 2017 and 2021.

As a result, selling pressure is currently noticeably lower than in the previous two years.  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373123872","id":102470,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T07:00:08.159Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T07:00:08.159Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T07:09:36.451Z","text_content":"🚨 JUST IN: Robert Kiyosaki downplays short term price movements in #GOLD , #Silver , and $BTC , citing rising US debt and declining dollar purchasing power.   \r \r The view highlights long term currency risk and macro driven capital positioning.","gravity_id":"373125047","id":102475,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T07:10:06.856Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T07:20:09.007Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T07:08:02.906Z","text_content":"$BTC best","gravity_id":"373125033","id":102476,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T07:10:07.245Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T07:20:09.258Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T07:07:45.036Z","text_content":"📈 Daily #Bitcoin price update (24h) 📉\n\n$BTC Price: $89394 (-0.74982%)","gravity_id":"373125031","id":102477,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T07:10:07.642Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T07:10:07.642Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T07:06:24.205Z","text_content":"Institutional capitulation or temporary setback? 🐻 Bitcoin Spot ETFs have seen $1.59B in outflows over the last 3 days, pushing $BTC   back to the $89K level.

What matters is capital movement: where funds are working, where they sit idle, and how quickly they can be reallocated.   A portfolio starts to function as a financial system rather than a collection of tokens.  ✅ This is where the conflict emerges. Part of the capital is allocated to lending, part to trading, and part remains in fiat for future entries. Without efficient fiat gateways and internal yield instruments, these flows become fragmented.   As a business analyst, I calculated that the loss was not market-driven but operational: capital downtime and delayed reallocations were reducing overall efficiency, while the portfolio view became increasingly fragmented.  The solution was to operate within a unified environment where capital flows can be managed centrally. 🚀 WhiteBIT combines for High Net Worth Individuals, additional products to make the portfolio even more strategic:  Crypto lending – earn up to 18.64% annually with fixed or flexible plans. On & off-ramp – seamless fiat–crypto conversion with high-limit SEPA transfers. Crypto borrow – receive digital assets for any term to trade, transfer, or withdraw. VIP trading program – lower fees and rewards for high-volume trading.  The portfolio shifts from a set of isolated positions to a coherent capital flow model, where every dollar and crypto unit is actively managed.  The conclusion is straightforward: large portfolios outperform not because of assets, but because of flow management.  Manage capital flows efficiently with WhiteBIT. https://institutional.whitebit.com/high-net-worth-individual?utm_source=coinmarketcap&utm_medium=hnwi_wb&utm_campaign=post   #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373126342","id":102606,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T08:50:08.988Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T08:50:08.988Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T08:45:37.257Z","text_content":"$BTC  eyes 👀 120 $90K decision zone as markets digest Strive’s $150M BTC buy plan and fresh institutional interest.

Bitdeer Technologies Group has officially surpassed MARA Holdings to become the largest bitcoin miner by managed hashrate.  As of December 2025, Bitdeer reported 71 EH/s under management, including 55.2 EH/s from self-mining operations. MARA’s latest disclosed figure stands at 61.7 EH/s of energized hashrate. The gap isn’t massive, but it’s symbolically important in a sector where scale and efficiency drive margins.  Production tells a similar story. Bitdeer mined 636 $BTC  in December, up sharply from 145 BTC a year earlier, helped by its in-house SEALMINER chips, which reportedly operate at 6–7 J/TH under optimized conditions. MARA’s fleet averages closer to 19 J/TH, though direct comparisons aren’t perfectly clean.  Strategically, the two miners are diverging. Bitdeer is monetizing mined BTC to fund expansion into AI and high-performance computing, building capacity across North America, Europe, and Africa. MARA continues to hold most of its $BTC   - now over 55,000 coins, and remains focused on scaling mining itself.  The takeaway: bitcoin mining is no longer just about hashpower. Energy efficiency, custom hardware, and AI adjacency are becoming just as critical in defining who leads the next phase of the industry. #BTC Price Analysis#  #BTC  #Mining","gravity_id":"373128095","id":102686,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T09:40:07.311Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T09:40:07.311Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T09:33:37.669Z","text_content":"Looking at the $BTC  weekly chart, I don’t think we will see any major bull run anytime soon.

He suggested that sharp price changes in cryptocurrencies have often been followed by corresponding inflationary movements months later, hinting at a recurring pattern that may warrant attention.  Pompliano highlighted two distinct market cycles to support his argument. First, he noted Bitcoin’s sharp rise in 2020, which preceded a surge in inflation. Later, he pointed to Bitcoin’s steep decline in 2025, followed by a slowdown in price pressures.

The White House wants a compromise, but I agree with the \"no bill is better than a bad bill\" stance. Banning stablecoin rewards guts the very utility that makes Web3 attractive to B2B partners. 🔸 2. Using \"affordable housing\" to pivot the Senate’s focus is a classic move to buy time for the banking lobby. It proves that stablecoins are finally seen as a real threat to the status quo. 🔸 3. We’re being told not to let \"perfect be the enemy of good”, but in my experience scaling products, a flawed regulatory foundation is much harder to fix than a 2-month delay.  Perhaps, we shouldn't really rush for a half-baked law.

In the professional world, your capital must move as fast as the order book. 📍 WhiteBIT’s On/Off Ramp Instant integration is built specifically for business and institutional entities that require zero-lag liquidity:  ✅ 10-second completion: EUR hits the account’s balance within just seconds while the price is still right. ✅ 5 EUR fee: forget about percentage-based commissions. With a fixed fee, your unit economics stay clean regardless of the transfer size. ✅ Scalable limits: WhiteBIT offers flexible, high-volume limits tailored to specific business needs through personal consultation.  The cost of waiting is often higher than the asset's volatility itself. If your business is ready to move into $BTC  crypto, your capital should move with you - instantly and predictably.  🔥 Start your crypto journey today with WhiteBIT On Ramp!  https://institutional.whitebit.com/payments-for-businesses?utm_source=coinmarketcap&utm_medium=sepa_business&utm_campaign=post   #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373128235","id":102723,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T10:00:10.879Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T10:00:10.879Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T09:51:44.443Z","text_content":"$BTC big shit","gravity_id":"373128225","id":102724,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T10:00:11.268Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T10:00:11.268Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T10:08:40.916Z","text_content":"Btcusdt short the game\nentry 88801\ntarget 86631-84968\nstop loss 92026\nleverage 100x\n\n\nThis channel is growing because of you guys, If you feel helped, help back tap drop the emot\n$BTC","gravity_id":"373128429","id":102732,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:06.560Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:06.560Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T10:07:45.278Z","text_content":"Bitcoin Quantum Testnet Shows How 6 Million Old BTC Face Risk\n\nhttps://deythere.com/bitcoin-quantum-testnet-shows-how-6-million-old-btc-face-risk/\n\n#BitcoinQuantumTestnet #OldBTC #oldBTCrisk #Quantumcomputer #QuantumTest #Bitcoin #Crypto #Market #News ","gravity_id":"373131040","id":102733,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:06.957Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:06.957Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T10:07:45.258Z","text_content":"🚨 JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Kansas introduces a bitcoin strategic reserve bill, allowing up to 10% of state trust fund assets to be invested in bitcoin ETFs. 🔥\n\n#bitcoin #btc #crypto #kansas #bitcoinetf #digitalassets #breakingnews #uspolitics ","gravity_id":"373132034","id":102734,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:07.391Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:07.391Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T10:07:45.252Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nWintermute has acquired additional PIPPIN, worth approximately $200,000, at its associated address.\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"373132033","id":102735,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:07.783Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:07.783Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T10:07:45.248Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nA Whale Liquidated a $18.3 Million #Bitcoin Short Position to Break Even and Exited the Position, Withdrawing a Significant Amount of Funds\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"373129118","id":102736,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:08.455Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:08.455Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T10:07:45.242Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\n#Binance Alpha This Round SPACE Airdrop Single Benefit about $100\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"373128421","id":102737,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:08.685Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:08.685Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T10:07:45.241Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nVirtuals: Users holding over 100 veVIRTUAL tokens are eligible for the ROBO public sale allocation\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"373129117","id":102738,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:08.945Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:08.945Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T10:07:45.237Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nCZ: When we are young, it is important to balance spending, saving, and investing to find the optimal point\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"373132028","id":102739,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:09.332Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T10:10:09.332Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T10:18:36.629Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $BTC  ALTCOIN SEASON SETUP? 🚀  Altcoin Dominance just bounced off historic support — same signal that kicked off massive runs in 2017 & 2021!  📈 Structure forming a long-term expanding wedge  Breakouts led to explosive alt rallies in previous cycles  2026 could be the next major peak in altcoin dominance (NFA)","gravity_id":"373132096","id":102753,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T10:20:06.952Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T10:20:06.952Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T10:18:12.798Z","text_content":"Kansas wants to hoard unclaimed crypto and airdrops for a Bitcoin reserve. 😂 They *almost* get it.

When buying Bitcoin instantly, users should weigh fees (including spreads), available payment methods, security standards, and transparency. Credit/debit cards and mobile payments like Apple Pay or Google Pay are usually the fastest, but they often come with higher costs. Liquidity, proof-of-reserves, fraud protection, and customer support can matter more than raw execution speed.\n\n2) How Major Exchanges Compare\nLeading platforms such as Bitget, Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and crypto(.)com all support instant Bitcoin purchases, but with different trade-offs. They vary in payment flexibility, fee structures, and safeguards. Some prioritize low fees via bank transfers or stablecoin conversions, while others focus on convenience with card and mobile payment options. These differences help users match an exchange to their priorities—whether that’s cost efficiency, ease of use, or added security measures.\n\n3) Practical Steps to Buy Bitcoin Instantly\nStart by creating and securing an account with two-factor authentication. Next, select a payment method based on your balance between speed and cost. Before confirming, review the quoted price carefully to account for fees and spread. After purchase, decide whether to store Bitcoin on the exchange with verified protections or move it to a private wallet for self-custody.\n\nBottom line: Instant Bitcoin access is widely available, but the best exchange depends on how you value speed, cost, and security. Comparing these factors helps you act quickly without unnecessary risk.","gravity_id":"373132116","id":102783,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T10:30:09.567Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T10:30:09.567Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T10:39:40.779Z","text_content":"On-Chain Data Reveals Major Liquidation Cluster Overhead\n\nAfter a significant price drop, the market is in a consolidation phase.

My plan for Bitcoin is basically the same as I posted yesterday.  The local trend is stil down, so I'm looking to enter shorts when I get the triggers per my system.

By holding the $89,300 level,  $BTC  has effectively neutralized the \"tariff-shock\" volatility seen earlier this week. From an analytical perspective, this isn't just a random bounce; it's a structural reset. ​My Take: The recent deleveraging event—which saw nearly $700M in futures liquidations—was a necessary \"cleansing.\" We’ve transitioned from a state of emotional \"chop\" into a high-conviction consolidation phase. While the macro environment remains sensitive to trade headlines, the on-chain data shows spot demand is absorbing the sell-side pressure. We are looking at a classic re-accumulation pattern before the next leg of expansion. ​The trend is your friend, and the trend currently screams continuation, not reversal. Staying patient during these sideways movements is what separates the winners from those who get shaken out by the noise. 📈 ​#BTC  #Bitcoin  #TechnicalAnalysis  #CryptoMarket  #MarketInsights","gravity_id":"373129670","id":102893,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T11:30:08.075Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T11:30:08.075Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T11:28:32.088Z","text_content":"$BTC holds the line at $89.3k.\n\n\nThat bounce confirms buyers are active.

Introduction  Buying $BTC   instantly in 2026 is easier than ever, but reliability depends on platform security, liquidity, compliance, and user experience. Choosing the right platform helps investors avoid delays, excessive fees, and custody risks while ensuring fast execution during volatile markets.  Centralized Exchanges for Instant Bitcoin Purchases?   Major centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitget, OKX, Bybit, KuCoin, and Crypto(.)com remain the most reliable options for instant Bitcoin purchases. They offer deep liquidity, fiat on-ramps, card and bank integrations, and near-instant execution. These platforms suit users who prioritize speed, ease of use, and customer support, though they require trusting a custodial provider.  Decentralized and Self-Custody Alternatives?   For users focused on self-custody, decentralized platforms and wallets integrated with on-ramp services allow instant Bitcoin purchases directly to personal wallets. While they reduce counterparty risk, users must manage private keys and accept higher technical responsibility.  Key Factors to Compare Before Buying?   Investors should compare fees, payment methods, regulatory compliance, withdrawal speed, and security history. Transparency and platform reputation matter more than promotional offers.  Conclusion  The most reliable platforms for buying Bitcoin instantly balance speed, security, and transparency.

It joins a long list of moments the market won’t forget, from the FTX collapse to exploits tied to Ronin and Wormhole, and even older scars like Mt. Gox.\nCentralized platforms haven’t been immune either. Price swings are part of crypto’s DNA. Exchange failures shouldn’t be. \n\nWhat Really Makes an Exchanges.\nSafety isn’t about branding it’s about evidence. The most reliable exchanges tend to share the same foundations: the majority of user funds held in cold storage, multi-factor and hardware-level security, transparent proof-of-reserves, a clear separation between user and company funds, insurance or protection funds for worst-case scenarios, and a clean or openly documented incident history.  \nTop Safer Crypto Exchanges\nCoinbase operates under strict U.S. oversight with public-company disclosures. Most assets sit in cold wallets, backed by insured hot wallets and routine audits.\n\nBitget has gained recognition for its defense-first approach, using multi-signature cold storage, frequent proof-of-reserves with excess coverage on major assets, ISO certifications, and a sizable on-chain protection fund.\n\nKraken is known for conservative operations and was an early proof-of-reserves adopter, maintaining a long breach-free track record.\n\nBinance, despite its scale, employs cold storage, device-level protections, anti-phishing tools, and a large emergency insurance fund, though regulatory exposure varies by region.\n\nConclusion\nIn crypto, security isn’t optional. Choosing exchanges with proven safeguards and reinforcing them with disciplined personal habits remains the most reliable way to protect capital in an increasingly complex market. https://www.bitget.com/academy/most-secure-crypto-exchanges-2026","gravity_id":"373132889","id":102966,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T12:10:06.800Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T12:10:06.800Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T12:08:16.609Z","text_content":"$BTC  holds the line at $89.3k.\r \r \r That bounce confirms buyers are active.

In a series of posts on X, Schiff said that while Gold and Silver continue to surge, Bitcoin has struggled to deliver comparable returns.  \r \r His comments come amid rising volatility across currency, bond, and crypto markets. He argues that such conditions tend to favor traditional stores of value.  \r \r Schiff pointed to fresh record highs in precious metals as evidence of changing investor priorities. Gold recently climbed to $4,967 per ounce, while Silver reached $99.24, with both metals setting new all-time highs.  \r \r At the same time, the U.S. Dollar Index fell to 98.37, marking a weekly decline of roughly 1%. According to Schiff, this divergence underscores mounting pressure on the dollar, reflecting heightened financial strain. It also illustrates why investors are increasingly seeking protection in hard assets.  \r \r Against this backdrop, Bitcoin has failed to keep pace, raising questions about its performance during periods of monetary stress.  \r \r As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading near $89,234, down 0.60% on the day and roughly 30% below its previous peak. Schiff contended that the primary risk for long-term holders is not a sudden market collapse. Instead, it lies in the opportunity cost of capital immobilized in an underperforming asset.  \r \r In his view, investors who remained in Bitcoin have missed substantial gains available in precious metals—a gap he described as increasingly difficult to overlook.","gravity_id":"373135275","id":103119,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T13:20:06.008Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T13:20:06.008Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T13:17:38.626Z","text_content":"$BTC \r Coinbase said it will list a perpetual futures contract for Sentient (#SENT ) on its futures рlatform, opening trading to eligible users per the CEX's statеment. the move broadens derivatives access alongside #Bitcoin  eхрosure - trаders should verify margin rules and jurisdictional аvailаbility before participating.\r \r #Coinbase  #Crypto    https://transscreen.ru/en/CMK_news29417","gravity_id":"373135267","id":103120,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T13:20:06.261Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T13:20:06.261Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T13:17:09.436Z","text_content":"$BTC  2026 VS 2022. 👀\r \r WE NEED TO BE MONITORING THIS AS IF IT IS A PATIENT WITH A HEART FAILURE IN THE ER.","gravity_id":"373134273","id":103121,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T13:20:06.687Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T13:20:06.687Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T13:11:52.899Z","text_content":"$BTC holds the line at $89.3k.\n\nThat bounce confirms buyers are active.

This isn’t about speculation — it’s about portfolio diversification and formally recognizing $BTC  as a macro-level asset. By using ETFs, Kansas avoids custody risks and operational complexity while still gaining regulated exposure, making this a clean and conservative framework. What makes this more important is the signal it sends. States don’t move fast, and they don’t chase hype. When a state considers $BTC  alongside traditional reserve assets, it quietly validates Bitcoin’s role in long-term capital preservation. This ETF-based approach is also easily repeatable, meaning other states could follow the same playbook without friction. If this trend spreads, $BTC  shifts from being debated as “risk-on” to being treated as strategic infrastructure in public finance. At that point, the narrative isn’t driven by price alone — it’s driven by adoption at the sovereign and institutional level.  ﻿Join us on Telegram: t.me/AlphaCryptoSignal  ﻿#CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#  #CMC Smart Quests#  #Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373130708","id":103140,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T13:30:08.314Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T13:30:08.314Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T13:25:02.870Z","text_content":"Market Insight | $BTC Holds Key Support at $89.3K\n\n\nBitcoin continues to defend the $89.3K level, with the rebound confirming active spot demand at this zone.

Nearly 49% of Gen Z have already used crypto exchanges, and 37% actively own or use crypto assets like $BTC . What stands out is why — younger users consistently point to control and transparency as the core reason they trust crypto more than traditional banks. This isn’t an all-or-nothing mindset. Gen Z is pragmatic: 56% want self-custody, but 51% are still open to banks and regulated financial services. They’re not rejecting the system outright — they’re reshaping it. Crypto is viewed as a way to own money directly, while banks are tools, not gatekeepers. That hybrid approach aligns naturally with assets like $BTC , where sovereignty and optionality coexist. The generational divide is stark. Trust in crypto drops steadily with age: 22% of Gen Z, 24% of Millennials, 13% of Gen X, and just 5% of Boomers.

Total market cap dipped to around $3.11T, and $BTC  briefly slipped below the $90K mark - even as Asian equities leaned higher on calmer macro signals.  Bitcoin led the move lower. Price hovered near $89.8K, down just 0.1%, as traders reacted to Asia’s open and digested central bank signals. The dip came despite improving risk mood across regional markets.  Once Bitcoin softened, the rest followed.  ETH slid about 1.7% to $2,960, while XRP dropped roughly 1.6% to $1.91. This wasn’t project-specific weakness - it was a mild, market-wide pullback tied to macro positioning.  What shaped the mood?  ➡ Asian stocks ticked higher after the Bank of Japan held rates steady, signaling policy stability.  MSCI’s Asia-Pacific index rose 0.4%, Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.3%, and investors balanced softer U.S. tariff rhetoric with signs of U.S. economic resilience.  So where does that leave crypto?  With equities steady and policy signals stable, crypto’s dip looks more like short-term adjustment than panic. For now, markets are watching whether $BTC  can reclaim $90K as Asia risk appetite slowly improves.  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373133919","id":103303,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T14:50:06.885Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T14:50:06.885Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T14:47:21.187Z","text_content":"$BTC Guys, I really like bitcoin!

Ironic, isn't it? Trusting your precious altcoins with some centralized service for...taxes.  French authorities are investigating a data breach at crypto tax platform Waltio, potentially exposing the data of 50,000 users. Shiny Hunters, the hacking group, is demanding a ransom after stealing user info. The real irony? They're probably targeting victims for \"wrench attacks\", kidnapping or threatening them to give up their crypto holdings. Meanwhile, France is also busy warning crypto firms about MiCA regulation compliance. Seems like a lot of activity in the altcoin world, all centered around a system of compliance and vulnerability. Remember, keeping your keys and your coins is the only way to stay safe in this space. Bitcoin $BTC  doesn't need \"tax platforms\" or government oversight.
