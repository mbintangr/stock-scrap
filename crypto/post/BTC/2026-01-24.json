Now What?  A new article just dropped on Cointelegraph - let’s break it down. Cointelegraph reports that $BTC  is entering an “early bear phase”, with the $80k–$84k zone emerging as the key support area. Here’s what the article is really saying:  According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin holders have started realizing net losses for the first time since October 2023.  👉 The Net Realized Profit/Loss metric fell to 69,000 BTC over the last 30 days, signaling weakening market strength. 👉 Annual realized profits also dropped sharply, back to March 2022 levels.  Historically, this shift often marks the transition from a bull phase into a bear phase.  Analysts compare the current setup to the 2021–2022 bull-to-bear transition: realized profit peaks → lower highs followed by a flip into net losses and then a broader bear market That said, CryptoQuant notes that profitability metrics can sometimes give false signals during consolidation periods.  ❌ BTC is now trading below the cost basis of 75% of supply (~$92.9k), increasing distribution pressure  Current trendline support: $89k–$90k Major support zone: $80k–$84k  ~940,000 BTC were accumulated here over the last six months. If this zone fails, the next major support sits around $80k  This doesn’t mean “Bitcoin is dead,” but it does mean the easy phase is over.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373140542","id":103692,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T18:00:08.931Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T18:00:08.931Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T17:57:34.571Z","text_content":"$BTC DUMP INCOMING!!!","gravity_id":"373143111","id":103693,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T18:00:09.581Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T18:00:09.581Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T17:56:12.289Z","text_content":"CZ thinks $BTC  supercycle in '26.

Crypto firms will jump through hoops, while Bitcoin, the OG, remains the only game in town. The FCA's moves are a clear sign of desperation. They can't stop it; they can only try to manage it. Good luck with that!

I expect $BTC  to spend a significant amount of time inside this range (potentially even throughout the next cycle). As I’ve said before, this bear market will look very different from previous ones.  🌊 Liquidity conditions remain supportive, which limits downside momentum. Instead of sharp collapses, we’re more likely to see local rallies and long consolidation phases, its like a constant tug of war between liquidity forces and Bitcoin’s cyclical nature.  💡 Given this structure, I wouldn’t expect deep moves far below the red line.

Such predictions create waves of excitement—and caution. While it’s tempting to chase the hype, it’s crucial to stay grounded.\n\n\nOn the other side, bearish signals and concerns—like those tied to quantum computing—are stirring anxiety. So, what should you do? First, balance optimism with risk management. Set stop-losses and don’t go all-in on speculative peaks. Second, watch institutional moves—like Galaxy’s new hedge fund—as they signal where big money is flowing. Finally, stay adaptable. The market will swing—your strategy should too.\n\n\nIn short: Bold predictions are exciting, but thoughtful planning will help you thrive—whether Bitcoin reaches $126,000 or takes a detour.\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373143844","id":103964,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T20:50:07.743Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T20:50:07.743Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T20:43:46.891Z","text_content":"$BTCDespite the political noise and market tension, I’m staying put and building my positions.

Now that the IMU launchpool is live on Bitget, I’m staking BGB to earn IMU and get in early, just in case this turns into another one of those moments.  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"373145238","id":104077,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T22:10:06.214Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T22:10:06.214Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T22:07:00.065Z","text_content":"WHY ARE YOU STILL ASKING FOR PERMISSION? 😤💼  Sending an international wire transfer in 2026 shouldn’t feel like asking your parents for lunch money.

Everyone can find their own approach. If you enjoy $BTC  trading - great. If you prefer building a long-term portfolio - that works too.  And if you don’t have time to watch charts all day, crypto passive income can still work for you.  Over time, crypto has moved far beyond simple buy and sell. Staking, earn programs, fixed-term deposits - all of these allow assets to generate yield without active trading. The real difference is not in the concept itself, but in how reliably these options work in practice.  That’s why I decided to revisit passive income offers across major exchanges.  🔹 Binance Earn usually offers single-digit or low double-digit APRs on popular assets, depending on lock-up periods and market conditions.  🔹 WhiteBIT Lending focuses on transparent crypto lending with fixed and flexed rates, quick opening and closing, and strong security - including 96% of assets stored in cold wallets.  🔹 Bybit Earn follows a similar model, prioritizing stability over aggressive yields.  🔥 On top of that, WhiteBIT is currently running a special Earn offer for new users, with interest rates up to 221% APR on fixed plans in USDT. It’s a limited onboarding option designed to let users test passive crypto income in real market conditions.  If you’re looking for a hands-off way to let crypto work in the background, this is one option worth checking while it’s available.  👉 Explore WhiteBIT Lending special offers: https://whitebit.com/earn/crypto-lending/list/fixed?utm_source=coinmarketcap&utm_medium=221_apr&utm_campaign=post   #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373145260","id":104100,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T22:20:08.729Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T22:30:10.636Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T22:12:22.781Z","text_content":"The only chart you need this #Bitcoin  bear market.   ﻿$BTC  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"373144622","id":104101,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T22:20:09.129Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T22:20:09.129Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T22:12:22.682Z","text_content":"🚨 $146.6M liquidated in the past hour, with shorts accounting for $143.4M of total\nrekt positions.  $BTC: 90,710$\n\n#Macro Insights# #BTC #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373144621","id":104102,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T22:20:09.528Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T22:20:09.528Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T22:11:13.098Z","text_content":"$BTC\nBinance considers bringing back #stock trading, The Information reports.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373144617","id":104103,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T22:20:09.933Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T22:20:09.933Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T22:10:49.410Z","text_content":"$BTC 4-YEAR FRACTAL STILL IN PLAY! 🚀\n\nHistorical cycles: 1,065-day bull runs, 365-day corrections\nCurrent projected bar pattern mirrors past bear phases\n\n#Bitcoin #Crypto","gravity_id":"373144613","id":104104,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T22:20:10.336Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T22:20:10.336Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T22:29:24.705Z","text_content":"$BTCBtc Pumping again 😍😍😍😍😍😍\n\nPump Pump Pump Pump","gravity_id":"373145371","id":104109,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T22:30:07.328Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T22:40:09.791Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-23T22:26:00.070Z","text_content":"🚨 WARNING: #SILVER  IS FLASHING A SYSTEM RISK SIGNAL… AND THE GAP CAN NO LONGER BE IGNORED\r \r \r COMEX shows silver near 100 per ounce but that number is no longer real. The physical market has broken away with Japan clearing around 145 the UAE near 165 and China around 140. A forty to sixty percent spread is not a discount. It is a signal that the paper market has detached from reality.\r \r \r Physical demand is overwhelming supply. Solar manufacturers are consuming annual output China is tightening exports and strategic reserves are at historic lows. The cheap price is only for paper claims that depend on trust in a system losing credibility.\r \r \r The reason the gap does not close is simple. Banks that dominate paper trading are heavily short. If silver snaps to the real clearing zone near 130 to 150 the losses on those positions would be massive and would hit balance sheets instantly. Tier one capital ratios would weaken and stress would show up across the system. This is not active price discovery. It is survival mode.\r \r \r Physical buyers are quietly removing silver from vaults while banks keep issuing synthetic exposure. Real metal leaves the system while paper claims multiply. As registered inventory drops each withdrawal increases the pressure. When the vaults reach a critical threshold the paper price becomes irrelevant and the market reprices to physical instantly.\r \r \r This is not ordinary manipulation. It is a structural warning that solvency risk is building in the background. If the squeeze accelerates silver can reprice violently and spill into other risk markets including crypto.

Right now, $BTC   isn’t sitting between the current level and the 4H 200MA/EMA, which historically acts as a support/resistance zone. This makes the price range a tricky place for aggressive swing trades.  Avoid chasing minor swings these can drain capital and energy fast.

Watch for breakouts above key resistance or dips to support zones to plan trades.  $BTC   is in a pause phase, not a trend phase.  Patience beats FOMO in sideways markets.

Entry would be just above 88,578.36 after confirmation, with targets at 90,088.94 and 90,574.00. - Alternatively, if price rallies and closes above 90,574.00 with strong bullish candles, a breakout entry toward 91,224.99 is possible, but only with a pullback and bullish continuation confirmation. - If price decisively loses 87,263.53 (the most recent swing low), my bullish bias is invalidated, and I would expect a further drop toward 86,100.00 and below. - Confirmation is key: Do not jump in without a clear reversal (for longs) or trend continuation (for breakouts).

However, the move lacked strong follow-through.  Price quickly faded, slipping back toward 89K, where $BTC    is now oscillating in a tight range.   This behavior suggests the bounce was reactionary rather than structural. While headlines can trigger short-term momentum, they don’t replace the need for solid spot demand and sustained inflows.   From a structure standpoint:    • 90–91K remains near-term resistance and a confidence threshold. • Failure to hold above it keeps BTC vulnerable to renewed range trading. • As long as price hovers below the low-90s, the market remains in balance-seeking mode, not trend continuation.   For now, volatility is being driven more by narratives and positioning than by a confirmed shift in underlying demand. Patience remains key until price acceptance improves above resistance.","gravity_id":"373148612","id":104259,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T01:50:04.992Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T02:20:07.376Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T01:51:51.643Z","text_content":"TradFi markets like forex, commodities (gold, oil), indices, and stocks are now accessible directly from the same app, I recently noticed that exchange like BingX are expanding beyond pure crypto trading, $BTC and other altcoins or memecoins.\nWhat stands out is the single-platform setup with no separate accounts or new interfaces.

Many institutional targets cluster in the low-to-mid six figures, but disagreement centers on whether institutional demand can outweigh weaker retail participation and how sensitive Bitcoin will be to global liquidity conditions.\r \r \r Several large financial institutions maintain six-figure outlooks. Standard Chartered and Bernstein both see $150,000 as a key level, though Standard Chartered recently lowered its forecast, citing a slower pace of gains and heavier reliance on ETF flows rather than corporate treasury buying. JPMorgan estimates a fair value near $170,000 using a gold-comparison model adjusted for Bitcoin’s higher volatility. More bullish voices such as Tom Lee project $200,000, while Charles Hoskinson has floated a $250,000 scenario based on supply constraints meeting rising institutional demand. More conservative views, like Carol Alexander’s, expect a wide, volatile range between $75,000 and $150,000.  \r \r \r \r The bull case depends largely on sustained institutional inflows, especially through spot ETFs and wealth management platforms. Some analysts believe ETF demand could at times rival or exceed new Bitcoin issuance, tightening market liquidity. On-chain data has also shown signs of renewed long-term holder accumulation, suggesting a shift toward longer-duration positioning.  \r \r \r \r The bear case, however, argues Bitcoin may have entered a bear-market regime in late 2025, with on-chain indicators pointing to continued downside risk if demand weakens and macroeconomic conditions tighten. ETF flows may also prove price-sensitive, slowing during risk-off periods.

Historically, this kind of deep negative demand zone appears near cycle pivot points when the market is absorbing more supply than it can digest.

When this persists, upside moves struggle to sustain and downside liquidity becomes easier to exploit.  BTC is coiling inside a demand deficit but volatility pressure is building from all sides.

In recent commentary, Hayes tied this ambitious target to expected massive fiscal expansion in the United States, including potential yield curve control policies under Treasury leadership and the creation of trillions in new credit through ongoing money printing and liquidity measures.\n\nHayes pointed to a scenario where the U.S. government pursues an \"imperial pivot,\" injecting over $15 trillion in new liquidity by 2028 to support economic dominance and debt management. He argued that Bitcoin, as a scarce digital asset, stands to benefit disproportionately from such inflationary pressures, positioning it as the \"fastest horse\" in a race against fiat devaluation.\n\nWhile Hayes clarified that he does not expect Bitcoin to precisely hit $3.4 million—believing the actual figure could be markedly higher—he used the number to illustrate the scale of upside possible under extreme monetary expansion and growing institutional adoption.\n\nThe forecast comes amid Bitcoin's continued strength in 2025, with Hayes emphasizing that traditional financial systems face structural challenges that could drive capital into non-sovereign assets like BTC.\n\n His analysis draws on macroeconomic models showing how unchecked liquidity growth historically boosts hard assets, and he maintains that Bitcoin's fixed supply makes it uniquely suited to capture value in this environment. Market observers note that while the prediction is highly bullish, it aligns with Hayes' consistent advocacy for Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat erosion and government overreach. $BTC\n\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373153651","id":104505,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T07:20:09.277Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T07:20:09.277Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T07:28:47.701Z","text_content":"$BTC Where are we really with Bitcoin?\n\n\nThe Pi Cycle Top indicator is not complicated:\nit shows when the Bitcoin market has become overheated in the past.\n\n\nSo…\nIn previous cycles, major peaks occurred when the faster trend line crossed the slower one from above.

Do ETAN rewards decrease over time like Bitcoin halving?\n\nNo, ETAN does not follow a halving model.\nReward distribution is designed to remain relatively stable over the long term. This is because\nour token model is not based on speculation, but on real economic activity.\nThe Fundamental Difference in the Reward Model\nThe key difference from many other crypto projects is that Etarn is backed by the following real-\nworld revenue sources:\n1. Liquid fertilizer sales\n2. Carbon credit generation\n3. Advertising revenue inside the smart toilets\nAs these real revenue sources grow, the funding pool used for the buyback of ETAN on the\nmarket grows accordingly.\nIncrease in Real-World Revenue, Expansion of Buyback Pool, Strengthening of Token\nSustainability\nThis allows us to achieve the following:\n• Reinforce long-term sustainability without needing artificial scarcity events (like halving).\n• Remove the fear of rewards drastically decreasing over time (FUD), ensuring continuous\nincentives for users.\nRewards are dynamically adjusted based on the total revenue generated by the ecosystem and\nthe total number of users at that time. This prevents over-distribution of rewards while creating\na healthy circulation where real business growth directly links to the token's stability and user\nbenefits.","gravity_id":"373153897","id":104533,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T07:50:06.970Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T07:50:06.970Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T07:55:57.950Z","text_content":"📝 The BTC ETFs saw weekly Net Outflows of over $1.3B.

For weeks, apparent demand for Bitcoin has remained in negative territory, signaling a structural shortfall in new spot buyers while the price continues to grind sideways. Historically, such deep negative demand zones often appear near market cycle pivot points, when the market is absorbing more supply than it can digest.  Whale holdings have remained relatively flat after a year of declines, suggesting that large players are no longer heavily distributing but have yet to begin aggressive accumulation. This neutral stance often marks the final phase before a directional move materializes.  The Dolphin Cohort (holders of 10 to 100 BTC) continues to contract on a monthly basis, indicating that mid-sized holders are taking a defensive stance and waiting for clearer confirmation. This group typically leads trend shifts, so continued downside pressure from them leaves the market vulnerable.  Coinbase Premium has remained negative to neutral, reflecting weak demand in the US spot market. When this condition persists, upward movements struggle to sustain, while downward liquidity becomes easier to exploit.  BTC is coiling inside a demand deficit, with volatility pressure building from all sides.

Introduction If you’re buying Bitcoin for the first time, choosing the right exchange matters more than most people realize. With hundreds of platforms available, not all are beginner-friendly, secure, or cost-effective. The right exchange can make your first BTC purchase simple and stress-free, while the wrong one can be confusing and expensive. This guide breaks down what beginners should prioritize when selecting a Bitcoin exchange, with an emphasis on usability, safety, liquidity, fees, and funding options.  What Beginners Should Look For Ease of use comes first. A clear interface, simple buy/sell features, and smooth onboarding reduce early mistakes.

Having more options means you’re not forced to move funds around just to access different assets. On most large exchanges, you’ll find major coins like $BTC, but the real difference shows when you start looking for newer or less common tokens.\n\nWhat Makes an Exchange Strong in Coin and Token Support?\n✅️ Regular new listings, not just old coins\n✅️ Active markets so trades don’t feel stuck\n✅️ A mix of large-cap and smaller tokens\n\nWhich Exchanges Support the Most Coins and Tokens?\nBitget – Offers a wide range of coins across spot and futures. It’s easy to find both popular tokens and newer projects without jumping platforms.\n\nBinance – Strong liquidity and a solid range of assets, though new listings can be more selective.\nKuCoin – Often mentioned for early access to emerging tokens like $ZEC and other altcoins.\n\nWhy Does Broad Asset Support Matter to Everyday Users?\n✅️ Easier portfolio management\n✅️ Less transferring between exchanges\n✅️ Better access to early market opportunities\n✅️ It saves time and keeps everything in one place, especially during active market periods.\n\nConclusion\nExchanges that support a wide range of coins and tokens tend to offer more flexibility for users. Bitget, Binance, and Kucoin stand out by combining asset variety with usable markets, which is what most everyday traders actually care about.\n\nFAQ\nDoes having more coins make an exchange better?\nNot automatically. It helps, but liquidity and ease of use matter just as much.\n\nAre smaller tokens worth trading?\nThey can be, but they usually come with higher risk and volatility.\n\nSource: https://www.bitget.com/academy/best-exchange-for-cryptocurrency-variety-2026\n\n#CMC Quest: Earn Rewards# #Marco Insights#","gravity_id":"373157762","id":104898,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T11:20:09.660Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T11:20:09.660Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T11:29:25.716Z","text_content":"$BTC broke above $91,000 yesterday, but sellers came on strong.\n\n\nBitcoin is now back into the no-trading zone, and this will probably continue due to the low liquidity weekend.\n\n\nUntil BTC breaks above the $91,000-$92,000 zone with strong spot demand, any upside will be short-lived.","gravity_id":"373160497","id":104912,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T11:30:06.947Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T11:30:06.947Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T11:28:45.088Z","text_content":"Robert Kiyosaki sold all his gold and silver for $BTC 11 months ago.\n\nSilver jumped 200%, gold 70%, Bitcoin hit $96k.\n\nEven the smartest investors can miss the biggest moves.\n\nTiming and patience often matter more than the asset itself.

What’s driving it: • Traders positioning early ahead of 2026 macro and regulatory clarity • Increased focus on tokens with cash-flow or staking mechanics • Lower liquidity amplifying upside moves in specific narratives  Insider take: This doesn’t look like a full altseason — yet. It looks like selective conviction, where capital flows into stories that can survive without BTC momentum.  If Bitcoin wakes up and confirms trend, these early movers could become leaders of the next leg. If not — weak narratives will fade fast.  Markets aren’t bullish yet. They’re curious. #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"373159128","id":104995,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T12:20:07.518Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T12:30:09.988Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T12:16:45.028Z","text_content":"Bitcoin is trapped on a “liquidation treadmill” where risky positions are being systematically hunted\n\nvia @andjelaradmilac \n\nhttps://cryptoslate.com/btc-liquidation-treadmill-is-back-and-futures-still-run-the-tape/","gravity_id":"373160744","id":104996,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T12:20:07.929Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T12:20:07.929Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T12:16:45.023Z","text_content":"🇺🇸 Las Vegas businesses cut credit card fees by accepting Bitcoin as Square offers zero-cost crypto processing through 2026 for millions of U.S. merchants.\n\n#Bitcoin #Payment\nhttps://cryptonews.com/news/las-vegas-businesses-ditch-credit-card-fees-for-bitcoin-payments/?feed_id=26380&_unique_id=6974a8fd82dc6","gravity_id":"373159121","id":104997,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T12:20:08.328Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T12:20:08.328Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T12:16:02.020Z","text_content":"🚨 Hayes says Fed dollar printing to prop up the yen would be very bullish for $BTC .  #BTC  #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"373158747","id":104998,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T12:20:08.726Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T12:20:08.726Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T12:11:56.221Z","text_content":"🚨 $BTC  Net Realized PnL dropped to a level we haven't seen since March 2022.  #Bitcoin  #BTC  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373159106","id":104999,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T12:20:08.988Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T12:20:08.988Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T12:11:54.688Z","text_content":"$BTC : The upside move for wave (4) appears technically complete, but there’s still a possibility that wave (4) develops into a broader ABC corrective structure.

Not just with price moves, but with support as well. When something goes wrong, fast customer service can save you money and a lot of stress.\n\nWhy Customer Support Speed Matters in Crypto?\nSlow replies can mean missed trades, frozen withdrawals, or hours of worry while funds are stuck. Quick support keeps traders calm, confident, and in control, especially when markets are moving fast.\n\nCrypto Exchanges Known for Fast Customer Service\nBased on user feedback and community experience, these exchanges are often praised for quick response times:\ni. Bitget is known for very fast live chat support, often replying within minutes.\nii. Bybit offers solid 24/7 support with real people answering quickly.\niii. Binance usually replies fast at first, though more complex issues can take longer.\niv. Coinbase provides decent support where live chat or phone support is available.\nv. Kraken is seen as professional and responsive, especially on live chat.\n\nHow to Get Faster Support on Any Exchange\nLive chat is usually the quickest option. Be clear about the issue, include transaction IDs or screenshots if needed, and keep your message short and direct. Verified or higher tier accounts often get faster replies too.\n\nConclusion\nNo exchange gets it right every time, but Bitget and Bybit currently stand out for fast customer service. For active traders, quick support is not a nice extra. It is essential.\n\nFAQ\nWhich exchange responds the fastest?\nBitget and Bybit are often the quickest, especially on live chat.\nIs live chat better than email?\nYes. Live chat is almost always faster than email.\nDoes location affect response time?\nYes. Support speed can change depending on your region and local demand.\n\nSource\nhttps://www.bitget.com/academy/best-crypto-exchange-for-customer-support-and-response-times-review\n#BTC Price Analysis#   $BTC","gravity_id":"373159279","id":105047,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T12:50:08.211Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T12:50:08.211Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T12:40:45.094Z","text_content":"📊 This week was a macro stress test: US–Europe tension + bond-yield shocks kept the market under constant pressure.\n\nCrypto reacted like it always does in a shock. BTC slipped under $90K, liquidations ripped past $1B in short bursts, and ETF outflows poured gasoline on every leg down.\n\nIf you trade quant signals, the move isn’t “pause.” The move is damage control.\n\n📌 Based on historical data from the last 7 days, we found a few selective time windows that are actually worth trading if you want to dodge the worst of the shock.\n\n• 11 UTC, time around the London open & macro digestion. In this window, volume picks up as Europe digests Asia’s overnight moves; trends often establish before US-driven chaos.\n→ Jan 19–20 saw strong directional pushes here (e.g., breakdowns with follow-through), while late-week (Jan 22–23) had reliable relief signals. Lower fakeout rate compared to thinner times.\n\n• 17 UTC, US midday. Peak liquidity aligns with macro repricing (e.g., yield stress + outflows hitting Wall Street desks).\n\n• 18–20 UTC, US peak to late session (close prep): Captures climactic resolutions (e.g., final dumps or bounces before handover).\n→ Jan 19–21 whipsaws resolved here with ETF rebalancing flows (~$400–500M outflows amplifying, then relief on signals). High vol, but structured (positioning-driven), making it theoretically prime for momentum/exhaustion plays.\nTariffs, geopolitics, policy pivots rewrite price behavior before anyone can label it, not you, not AI, not even “senior trader”.\n\nIf you use quant signals, the goal isn’t to stop trading.

GameStop’s unrealized PnL has flipped from months of profits into a growing loss zone as BTC dropped below a key psychological level. This marks a sharp shift in sentiment: from confident holders sitting on gains to positions now underwater. The expanding red zone highlights rising stress, which historically increases pressure on large holders to cut exposure.  On-chain balance data backs this up. After a long accumulation phase, the address has stopped adding BTC and is now showing its first notable outflows, even as price continues to trend lower. This kind of divergence often points to early distribution risk among corporate holders. The invested value vs. current value chart shows GameStop’s BTC holdings are now worth significantly less than their cost basis. When major holders remain below breakeven for extended periods, behavior tends to turn reactive, often magnifying volatility, especially in low-liquidity conditions. All of this places BTC at a pivotal moment, trading near cyclical equilibrium while on-chain losses continue to grow. If forced selling emerges, volatility could spike quickly. If BTC stabilizes and regains momentum, these loss clusters can instead become the catalyst for sharp upside reversals as capitulation plays out. Clean data. Elevated tension.  A trend-defining zone is forming for Bitcoin. ﻿#Zed  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373161932","id":105067,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T13:00:15.915Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T13:00:15.915Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T13:07:18.860Z","text_content":"$BTC\n\nBitcoin x Business Cycles\n\nhttps://t.me/+n-eoyjJtOuY5ZWZl\n\nEvery major BTC bull run (2013, 2017, 2021) started when ISM PMI bounced back above 50.\n\nPMI has been weak since 2024… but the chart signals a 2026 recovery.\n\nIf history repeats, 2026 could trigger Bitcoin’s next major breakout. 📈🔥\n\n\n#bitcoin #etherum #Meme Alpha#","gravity_id":"373159426","id":105082,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T13:10:07.223Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T13:10:07.223Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T13:06:49.768Z","text_content":"🚨HUGE  BILLIONAIRE TIM DRAPER SAYS BITCOIN $BTC  WILL REACH $10,000,000 ONE DAY AND THE DOLLAR WILL NO LONGER BE ACCEPTED! 💥💰 ﻿$RIVER  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373163047","id":105083,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T13:10:07.706Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T13:10:07.706Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T13:04:45.066Z","text_content":"Bitcoin vola - Key Insights and Market Analysis -  https://cryptonewsmax.com/bitcoin-vola-key-insights-and-market-analysis/  $BTC $ETH #crypto #bitcoin #blockchain #cryptonewsmax","gravity_id":"373159414","id":105084,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T13:10:07.955Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T13:10:07.955Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T13:04:45.063Z","text_content":"Bitcoin Trader 0xFC78’s Revenge Trading Wipes Out $1.78M Profits ... -  https://cryptonewsmax.com/bitcoin-trader-0xfc78s-revenge-trading-wipes-out-1-78m-profits/  $BTC $ETH #crypto #bitcoin #blockchain #cryptonewsmax","gravity_id":"373163035","id":105085,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T13:10:08.349Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T13:10:08.349Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T13:04:45.052Z","text_content":"Bank of America Bitcoin - Key Insights and Market Analysis -  https://cryptonewsmax.com/bank-of-america-bitcoin-key-insights-and-market-analysis/  $BTC $ETH #crypto #bitcoin #blockchain #cryptonewsmax","gravity_id":"373162043","id":105086,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T13:10:08.756Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T13:10:08.756Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T13:04:45.049Z","text_content":"American Bitcoin Stock - Key Insights and Market Analysis -  https://cryptonewsmax.com/american-bitcoin-stock-key-insights-and-market-analysis/  $BTC $ETH #crypto #bitcoin #blockchain #cryptonewsmax","gravity_id":"373164018","id":105087,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T13:10:09.151Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T13:10:09.151Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T13:04:45.049Z","text_content":"Bitcoin now settles Visa-scale volumes, but most is for wholesale, ... -  https://cryptonewsmax.com/bitcoin-now-settles-visa-scale-volumes-but-most-is-for-wholesale/  $BTC $ETH #crypto #bitcoin #blockchain #cryptonewsmax","gravity_id":"373162042","id":105088,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T13:10:09.550Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T13:10:09.550Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T13:04:23.035Z","text_content":"🚨 LEE 🗣️ “I still don’t think $200,000 $BTC  is that crazy.

Historically, this zone reflects heavy realized losses as weak hands exit positions, often near late-stage corrections rather than early ones. When $BTC  reaches these levels, the market is usually flushing excess leverage and emotional selling. What makes this notable is context. Despite depressed realized PnL, $BTC  continues to trade within a higher macro range compared to past cycles, suggesting structural demand is absorbing sell pressure. Similar conditions in prior cycles preceded stabilization phases and, eventually, trend reversals once selling exhaustion set in. This doesn’t guarantee an immediate bounce, but it does highlight a shift in risk-reward. When Net Realized PnL compresses this deeply, $BTC  historically transitions from distribution to rebuilding.

Policy decisions like this rarely move markets overnight — but historically, they shape the environment where long-term adoption happens. And for $BTC , those quiet steps often matter far more than loud headlines.

Altcoins have dropped and many are sitting at the bottom, while $BTC  and ETH have been stuck in a range for over two months. And by the way, there’s a high chance this range breaks to the downside soon — check my previous posts where I explained why I’m expecting a correction.  This is exactly the kind of moment when the market shakes out weak hands. I’m seeing more and more people wanting to close positions at a loss and move money into stocks (the equity market), because things are growing much faster there. Just yesterday, for example, we closed a trade with +52% profit — it was the US company Intellia (NTLA). We bought the stock and made that return in just 12 days 👌  To avoid missing trades like this, I recommend subscribing to my TG-channel (link in the bio and pinned post). Today, for example, I’ll be posting a useful audio podcast there about a strategy used by large capital.  Trading everything is the right approach. It lowers risk and ensures there are always opportunities — I’ve written about this many times.  But the key point is something else. It’s exactly in moments like these — when the market is boring and nothing is really moving — that real, successful traders and investors are made.  When people ask me what my day usually looks like, I say: boring 😅 Successful trading is boring. 90% of the time we’re just waiting for a position to play out and for the asset to grow. The remaining 10% is spent on analysis, opening and closing positions, filling out a trading journal, searching for new setups, running a blog, and so on.  Only when this becomes routine for you does success come. As long as you’re having fun and chasing emotions like in a casino, chances are you’re trading at a loss.  The hardest part of trading is waiting. And not everyone is ready for that ❤️","gravity_id":"373162298","id":105173,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T14:00:08.315Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T14:00:08.315Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T13:52:41.231Z","text_content":"$BTC  Technical Structure:-  👉 Cycle High Formed At 66% (High Time Frame Supply Zone) 👉 Strong Rejection From Bearish Order Block + FVG 👉 Support Trendline Broken in Monthly and Weekly 👉 Bearish Retest Completed Near 60% 👉 HTF Structure Remains Weak Below 60–62%","gravity_id":"373159667","id":105174,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T14:00:08.726Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T14:00:08.726Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T13:52:29.422Z","text_content":"$BTC  👉 BTC Dominance About To Trigger Biggest Alt Season Ever :-     👉 Bitcoin Dominance Is Trading At A Major Higher Time Frame Distribution Zone After Printing A Cycle High Near 66%, With Price Rejecting From Bearish OB + FVG Supply And Shifting Structure Bearish.","gravity_id":"373162297","id":105175,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T14:00:08.994Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T14:00:08.994Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T14:09:10.801Z","text_content":"$BTC  I clearly remember the same situation… all the analysis and indicators were saying BULLISH.

He believes two rate cuts this year are appropriate.\n\n\n📊Next, technical analysis.\n\n\nBased on the liquidity chart, we see that liquidity is above the surface—fuel, where the price is heading! On another chart, we see liquidity at a low, but closer to the current price. Keep this in mind.\n\n\nInterest, volume, and RSI are low and have been declining this week amid the decline. RSI is 37, oversold, and there's a risk of an upward correction to 91000.\nA price decline with declining volume and interest (open interest) usually signals weakness in the current trend, indicating that sellers are losing momentum and buyers are inactive. This often heralds a halt in the decline or a market reversal, as the withdrawal of participants indicates exhaustion of momentum.\n\n\nAs we see now, a local bottom is forming\n\n\n✍️My verdict: Next week will be highly volatile. I admit we could be carried to 86000, but only for the short term, which is why I have a limit buy on the futures contract there. But by the end of Friday, we'll definitely be above 89,500, and I think 92,000 and higher.\nI'm positive about the market!\n⚡️⚡️Follow me for more analysis!\nAlso, subscribe to my Telegram channel, there's a 100 USDT giveaway coming soon, I'll announce it next week. 🚀🚀\nP.S.
