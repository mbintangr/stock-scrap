For the first time in three decades central banks now hold more gold than US debt. This is not a minor rebalancing. It is a global vote of no confidence in the dollar. Foreign holders are no longer chasing yield. They are protecting principal because treasuries can be seized inflated away or weaponized through sanctions.  Gold carries zero counterparty risk and that single feature has changed the entire reserve playbook. The moment reserves became a geopolitical tool every nation understood their assets were only safe if they were physical. If you own a promise it can be frozen. If you own gold you own it.  Meanwhile US debt is climbing at one trillion dollars every hundred days and interest costs are passing one trillion per year. The only mathematical outcome is more printing. The world sees the debasement coming and is reallocating before the wave hits.  You can already see the shift. China Russia India Poland Singapore and many others are reducing exposure to US paper while stacking hard collateral. BRICS is accelerating this trend by building payment rails outside SWIFT settling energy in local currencies and backing reserves with assets that cannot be printed. Once over forty percent of the world decides the dollar is optional demand structurally declines. TINA is gone. Gold is the alternative.  This does not signal the end of the US today but it marks the beginning of a new monetary regime. If you think silver at one hundred or gold at five thousand is impossible you are not prepared for what comes next. Stress in reserves eventually spills into funding markets and risk assets including crypto react quickly when confidence cracks. Even $BTC  moves sharply when global liquidity rotates into hard collateral.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373168660","id":105560,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T18:00:08.764Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T18:00:08.764Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T17:55:35.261Z","text_content":"The year is 2014. $99 per $BTC . \r \r Would you have done this?

With global tensions rising and Trump-era tariff talks on Europe resurfacing, it’s not far-fetched to speculate #GOLD  could push toward $7,000/oz if things escalate. That’s the kind of macro move I don’t want to watch from the sidelines.  What’s made this even more interesting is the Bitget TradFi Gold Trading Competition (Phase 2) $88,000 up for grabs while trading these uptrends. Being able to rotate capital from crypto into commodities seamlessly, plus compete for rewards, has been a real edge for me.  Sometimes the opportunity isn’t in waiting for #Bitcoin   to move it’s in trading what already is.","gravity_id":"373172130","id":105686,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T19:30:07.327Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T19:30:07.327Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T19:27:12.595Z","text_content":"JUST IN: 🇦🇪 According to report, Revolut prepares to offer crypto services in the UAE.\n\n $BTC #BTC #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373171181","id":105687,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T19:30:07.733Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T19:30:07.733Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T19:24:34.066Z","text_content":"Big banks finally realize $BTC  is an existential threat.

It’s giving “chill and watch” energy more than “all in euphoria” or “panic sell” energy","gravity_id":"373171397","id":105750,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T20:20:08.197Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T20:20:08.197Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-24T20:11:35.489Z","text_content":"𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐬 𝐢𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐥𝐲 𝐝𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐛𝐲 #𝐁𝐢𝐭𝐜𝐨𝐢𝐧.

Calls were getting bought, momentum picked up, and it felt like the market was ready to run.\nBut here's the part worth slowing down for.\nGlassnode dug into the options data and found that most of that bullish action was very short-term. The 1-week skew flipped fast as BTC jumped about 8%, which usually looks like confidence coming back. The catch? That confidence didn't extend much further. When you look out to one-month and three-month options, traders were still paying for downside protection. In simple terms, people traded the bounce - but they didn't bet on a real breakout yet. Volatility was even being sold as price moved higher.\nSo if you're watching for BTC to revisit $97,600, don't just watch the candles. Watch whether longer-dated options start pricing upside and volatility gets bid.

While Bitcoin’s bearish momentum is technically fading, the lack of volume creates a \"flat\" environment where traditional buy-and-hold strategies underperform.  To maintain efficiency, I’ve optimized my toolkit into 3 layers:  🔥1. Analysis (Glassnode): I don't look at price - I look at Realized Cap. It’s the only way to see if actual capital is entering the network or if we’re just seeing speculative noise. Currently, it’s my primary tool for spotting a real trend reversal.  🔥2. Orientation (Nansen): in a sideways market, alpha is hidden in rotation. I use Nansen to track Smart Money flows.

Bitdeer Technologies Group has officially surpassed MARA Holdings to become the largest bitcoin miner by managed hashrate.\r \r \r As of December 2025, Bitdeer reported 71 EH/s under management, including 55.2 EH/s from self-mining operations. MARA’s latest disclosed figure stands at 61.7 EH/s of energized hashrate. The gap isn’t massive, but it’s symbolically important in a sector where scale and efficiency drive margins.\r \r \r Production tells a similar story. Bitdeer mined 636 $BTC  in December, up sharply from 145 BTC a year earlier, helped by its in-house SEALMINER chips, which reportedly operate at 6–7 J/TH under optimized conditions. MARA’s fleet averages closer to 19 J/TH, though direct comparisons aren’t perfectly clean.\r \r \r Strategically, the two miners are diverging. Bitdeer is monetizing mined BTC to fund expansion into AI and high-performance computing, building capacity across North America, Europe, and Africa. MARA continues to hold most of its $BTC  - now over 55,000 coins, and remains focused on scaling mining itself.\r \r \r The takeaway: bitcoin mining is no longer just about hashpower.

Current data shows only ~84 BTC leaving miner wallets — levels historically seen near major market bottoms. In past cycles, spikes in miner outflows marked panic and capitulation, while periods like this reflected miner confidence and a sharp reduction in forced selling pressure on $BTC . At the same time, $BTC  price action is compressing as supply from miners continues to dry up. When miners stop selling, liquidity tightens — and volatility tends to return fast. This combination often precedes a liquidity squeeze and impulsive move, making the current structure a strategic inflection point for $BTC . Miner behavior is starting to rhyme with previous macro reversals, and the breakout window is approaching. 👀  ﻿Join us on Telegram: t.me/AlphaCryptoSignal  #CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#  #CMC Smart Quests#  #Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373182567","id":106339,"createdAt":"2026-01-25T07:10:07.091Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-25T07:20:09.353Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-25T07:08:00.762Z","text_content":"WHALES ARE BUYING #BITCOIN  LIKE NEVER SEEN BEFORE  SOMETHING IS COMING BIG TIME 🚀   ﻿$BTC  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373181982","id":106340,"createdAt":"2026-01-25T07:10:07.500Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-25T07:20:09.621Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-25T07:07:45.127Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nA whale/institution bought 4300 XAUT tokens 8 hours ago at an average price of $5049\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"373181979","id":106341,"createdAt":"2026-01-25T07:10:07.909Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-25T07:20:09.873Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-25T07:07:45.043Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nA certain contract whale went 20x long on $BTC in the past day, with an overall position size exceeding $63 million\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"373181977","id":106343,"createdAt":"2026-01-25T07:10:08.599Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-25T07:20:10.699Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-25T07:07:31.262Z","text_content":"🟠🇨🇴 BITCOIN MOVES INTO PENSION SAVINGS IN COLOMBIA  Colombia’s second-largest pension manager, AFP Protección, is preparing a new fund that allows Bitcoin exposure.

The ratio has reached deep value territory right at the long-term moving average, a zone that has historically marked major cycle reversals in favor of $BTC . When $BTC  hits long-term support against gold, it usually signals a shift in relative strength. Gold preserves value, but $BTC  captures growth. If history rhymes, this setup favors reallocating from defensive assets into asymmetric upside.
