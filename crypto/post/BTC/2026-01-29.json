While everyone is 97% sure rates aren't moving, the real drama starts 30 minutes later when Jerome Powell speaks. If he sounds even slightly grumpy about inflation, things could get bumpy.  📊 Here is how I’m looking at the big two right now:  🔺 Bitcoin ($BTC ) Bitcoin is currently hovering around the $90,200 mark, and honestly, it looks a bit tired. It’s been knocking on the door of $92,000 for a while now but hasn't found the strength to kick it down. My take? It feels like BTC is on a tightrope. If Powell comes off as \"hawkish\" (meaning he’s okay with keeping rates high for longer), we might see a quick slide down to $85,000 to find some solid ground. However, if he hints that the economy is cooling enough for future cuts, that $92,000 ceiling will turn into a floor very fast.  🔺 Ethereum ( $ETH ) Ethereum is actually showing some backbone here. It’s staying steady above $3,000, which is a huge psychological level for traders. To me, $ETH looks like it’s just waiting for a green light to run. If the news is even slightly positive, I can see it breaking past $3,300 and making a sprint for $3,500. On the flip side, if the whole market takes a hit, it might dip to $2,700, but right now, its technical setup looks a bit more \"ready\" for a bounce than $BTC   does.  In my opinion, today is less about the charts and more about the vibe of the Fed. Once the speech is over and the dust settles, the direction for the next few weeks should become a lot clearer.

MoonPay issues the token, which Citrea positions as compliant with the GENIUS Act framework. The project built ctUSD as a settlement and liquidity layer supporting institutional-grade activity natively anchored to Bitcoin.\r  Citrea raised $16.7 million across two funding rounds. The platform joins numerous Bitcoin-focused projects attempting to enable additional functions on the original blockchain. Rather than holding Bitcoin passively long-term, these firms seek to enable monetization through lending and stablecoin issuance.\r  Orkun Kilic, co-founder and CEO of Chainway Labs, which is building Citrea, said the mainnet brings Bitcoin-secured financial activity on-chain. The platform enables BTC-backed lending and institutional credit with settlement through ctUSD. The stablecoin does not rely on intermediaries or wrapped BTC.\r  More than 30 Bitcoin-native applications are prepared to serve users across additional financial use cases, according to Citrea.

As a senior figure at BlackRock, he has a strong market track record and aligns more closely with Democratic economic thinking.\nDespite his solid odds, he is unlikely to be Trump’s final choice.\n\n2. Kevin Hassett (Leading Candidate)\nKevin Hassett currently remains the top contender, with over 80% probability of winning. He supports interest rate cuts and argues that inflation is effectively non-existent, leaning toward a zero-inflation framework.\nHassett is strongly aligned with Trump’s economic vision and is widely expected to secure the position. His appointment would likely be highly bullish for equities and crypto markets, while gold and silver may underperform under his policies.\n\n3. Kevin Warsh\nKevin Warsh has a significantly lower probability compared to the two candidates above. He believes in a strong U.S. dollar and favors gradual interest rate hikes.\nSuch a stance would be negative for gold and cryptocurrencies, and for this reason, Warsh is unlikely to be Trump’s preferred option.\n\n📊 Analysis & Commentary:\nAlireza Abbas Beygi","gravity_id":"373292259","id":107741,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T21:10:07.961Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T21:10:07.961Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-28T21:18:33.395Z","text_content":"JACOB & CO PUTS A 1,000 TH/S MINER IN A WATCH.\n\nThey just unveiled a limited edition watch with a built-in  $BTC miner.\n\nThe hash rate is rated at 1,000 TH/s.

Prices swing with match results, athlete trades, and market cycles, making long-term sustainability hard to achieve.\n\nBut the FIGHT token, launched in partnership with Fight.ID (a UFC partner), flips that model by anchoring value to continuous fan participation rather than win-loss speculation.\n\nUnlike most fan tokens tied to individual teams, FIGHT powers the entire digital MMA fandom.\n\nA single fighter losing doesn’t inherently threaten the token’s value. Instead, participation becomes the primary driver, channeled through quests, campaigns, and giveaways centered around official weekly fight cards.\n\nEvery event fuels activity. Every participating fan builds a reputation that unlocks governance rights, merchandise, discounted tickets, and exclusive experiences.\n\nThe rapid growth of sports fan tokens proves demand for SportFi is real. Even Tether has invested heavily in the sector.\n\nNow, with FIGHT, we’ve seen one of the most successful TGEs in a while, outpacing many existing fan tokens in scale and traction already.\n\nA new foundation for SportFi is taking shape, one designed to scale participation, not just speculation.\n\n#Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"373290884","id":107758,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T21:20:07.856Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T21:20:07.856Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-28T21:12:48.097Z","text_content":"$BTC coin scam👎👎👎","gravity_id":"373289843","id":107759,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T21:20:08.030Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T21:20:08.030Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-28T21:10:35.044Z","text_content":"🚨🚨 \"Bonds no longer a safe hedge,\" BlackRock has said.\n\n $BTC #BTC","gravity_id":"373289838","id":107760,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T21:20:08.324Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T21:20:08.324Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-28T21:29:41.405Z","text_content":"👀 Tesla TSLA reveals none of their $1,000,000,000 #Bitcoin  was sold in Q4 2025. #crypto   BTC  $TSLA  $BTC","gravity_id":"373289928","id":107765,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T21:30:05.512Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T21:30:05.512Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-28T21:28:46.180Z","text_content":"I'm bearish on $BTC   they gonna grind, chop u into oblivion all while launching more bots, laughing all the way to the banks..","gravity_id":"373289919","id":107767,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T21:30:05.886Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T21:30:05.886Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-28T21:27:52.974Z","text_content":"Morgan Stanley Appoints Head of Digital Asset Strategy\n\nMorgan Stanley has officially hired a Head of Digital Asset Strategy, marking another step in the continued integration of digital assets into traditional finance.

I said \"revealing\", but in reality, my close followers, know this one very well.  Because indeed, historically, 90% of the time, the market tops or bottoms a few days before the FOMC meeting taking place, happening right here, right now.  The long we presented a few days ago at the time of the very bottom being place, was almost exactly during that time window, scratching almost the very low.  I have posted about this type of analysis many times in the past. Just go to my profile and search \"FOMC Reversal\", I won't comment too much further.  For the lazy, a snippet of data is presented below, and the logic is simple. The best time to enter a trade happens before FOMC because the majority is too afraid to hold through it.  So I'm once again doing the opposite, of not closing, but holding longs here and expect higher, not lower.

I expect price to retest these levels next.  #BTC  is still trading below the recent uptrend + all major EMAs confirming the broader downtrend and with most liquidity sitting at the bottom of the range around $84,000 (blue lines = untouched liquidity) my overall bias remains bearish.

Here’s the constraint: Options. • Net gamma is positive → volatility suppressed • Price pinned near ~$90k • Support near ~$85k • Upside supply clustered at $100K +  Now the key part most people miss: ~43% of total gamma expires around Jan 30.

Price is still nearly 30% below the $125K peak, but instead of panic, the market is consolidating-  a sign that weak hands are mostly gone and positioning is getting cleaner.  Macro conditions are quietly supportive. Inflation is holding near 2.7%, GDP growth surprised to the upside, and markets are still pricing in two Fed rate cuts. That backdrop keeps risk assets afloat, even as job growth slows and investors become more selective rather than fully risk-on.  Market structure confirms the shift. Bitcoin dominance climbed to 59% while mid and small caps struggled, and traders moved from perpetuals to options. Demand for downside protection is rising, suggesting caution - not euphoria - is driving decisions here.  📌 Bottom line:  On-chain sentiment has slipped into the “Anxiety” zone, but historically this phase aligns more with late-cycle consolidation than capitulation. Bitcoin isn’t breaking out yet - but it’s also not breaking down.

Price is still nearly 30% below the $125K\npeak, but instead of panic, the market is consolidating- a sign that weak hands are mostly gone and positioning is getting cleaner.\nMacro conditions are quietly supportive. Inflation is holding near 2.7%, GDP growth surprised to the upside, and markets are still pricing in two Fed rate cuts. That backdrop keeps risk assets afloat, even as job growth slows and investors become more selective rather than fully risk-on.\nMarket structure confirms the shift. Bitcoin dominance climbed to 59% while mid and small caps struggled, and traders moved from perpetuals to options. Demand for downside protection is rising, suggesting caution - not euphoria - is driving decisions here.\nBottom line: On-chain sentiment has slipped into the \"Anxiety\"zone, but historically this phase aligns more with late-cycle consolidation than capitulation. Bitcoin isn't breaking out yet - but it's also not breaking down.

With markets already shaky, this isn’t surprising. As winter approaches and energy supplies tighten, prices especially natural gas tend to rise, shifting sentiment from “wait and see” to acting quickly and carefully. During these phases, capital often rotates out of riskier assets and into safer plays like energy, metals, and gold.  I’ve been focusing more on commodities through Bitget TradFi, where gold hitting new all-time highs has worked well for me. With the Bitget TradFi $XAUt  trading competition live, the setup looks even more interesting.

Support Zones:  $0.04900–$0.05100 — primary demand area.  Lower pink zone — backup support if momentum fades.  Resistance Target: $0.05850–$0.06000 — next upside zone to watch.  📈 Bullish Scenario A retest of $0.05500 followed by bullish candles (e.g., hammer, engulfing) could trigger a move toward $0.05850–$0.06000.  A close above $0.05700 would confirm strength.  📉 Bearish Risk If price breaks below $0.05500, expect a pullback toward the grey zone.  Breakdown below $0.04900 would invalidate the bullish setup and shift momentum.  $CHZ   is in a healthy post-breakout phase. A minor retracement could offer better entries before the next leg up.

On one side, $XAUt  stretched to extremes crowded, overbought, and priced for fear. On the other, Bitcoin left for dead  deeply oversold, ignored, and written off by sentiment.  This isn’t random. It’s how capital behaves before rotation.  For months, money has hidden in “safety,” chasing stability at any cost. But safety trades don’t compound forever. Eventually, manipulation fades, liquidity shifts, and psychology flips. When that happens, capital doesn’t trickle  it rotates violently.  Bitcoin has always been the bridge in that moment. Not as a risk asset, but as an escape hatch. When Gold and Silver investors start diversifying for asymmetric upside, $BTC   becomes the first stop. Then comes the second wave… Alts.  That’s where history gets aggressive. BTC doesn’t move 2x in these phases  it reprices. Alts don’t rally  they reset entire market structures.  This is how 10x in Bitcoin becomes obvious in hindsight. This is how 50–100x in Alts looks “impossible” until it’s already happened.  Smart money isn’t emotional. It waits for extremes like this when disbelief is high, narratives are broken, and price is disconnected from future reality.  We’re closer to that pivot than most people realize. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#   ﻿#Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373296748","id":108015,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T01:20:04.974Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T01:30:06.145Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T01:16:36.161Z","text_content":"Dubai Insurance Launches Digital Wallet for Crypto Payments    #DubaiInsurance  has introduced a digital wallet enabling policyholders to pay premiums and settle claims using digital assets. The wallet operates through Zodia Custody's institutional infrastructure, marking the first such service in the UAE insurance industry.   The platform supports both premium payments and claim settlements in cryptocurrency while maintaining compliance with UAE regulatory frameworks. Founded in 1970, Dubai Insurance provides general and life insurance products throughout the country.   Zodia Custody's managing director for commercial operations in the Middle East and Africa, Zane Suren, stated that insurers require trusted infrastructure as digital asset adoption grows. The custody partnership ensures policyholders can transact confidently with digital assets.   Dubai Insurance has not disclosed which specific digital assets will be supported at launch. The company has also not confirmed whether the wallet will initially be available across all insurance products or limited to certain offerings.   The development reflects broader insurance sector experimentation with digital assets across multiple areas. Meanwhile, a company offering $BTC -denominated insurance products, secured $82 million in October funding led by Bain Capital Crypto and Haun Ventures.   Meanwhile provides life insurance, annuities, savings products, and insurance bonds, with premiums, policy values, and claims managed entirely in $BTC . The expansion of crypto payment options in traditional finance sectors continues as #digital  #asset  #adoption  accelerates globally.   The UAE has emerged as a significant hub for #cryptocurrency  integration in traditional financial services. The move by Dubai Insurance demonstrates institutional willingness to incorporate blockchain-based payment methods into established business models.","gravity_id":"373296735","id":108016,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T01:20:05.283Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T01:30:06.445Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T01:15:56.255Z","text_content":"Jacob & Co launches a watch with a built-in 1,000 TH/s $BTC  miner.

It anchors a philosophy that collective belief and cultural signalling can underpin value, combining memetic velocity with intentional supply mechanics.  Philosophy: $GOHOME  treats memes as modern social assets. Rather than chasing ephemeral hype, the project emphasises long-term community alignment, fairness, and resilience. Its narrative frames the token as a second chance for participants excluded from prior gains, focusing on participation over speculation.  Tokenomics and governance: The supply is fixed at 10,000,000 tokens. 9,000,000 are time-locked until January 2029, leaving a constrained circulating supply. The token is deployed on Solana (contract: 2Wu1g2ft7qZHfTpfzP3wLdfPeV1is4EwQ3CXBfRYAciD). This structure seeks to promote scarcity, align incentives for long-term stewardship, and reduce short-term inflationary pressure.  Community and leadership: Led by founder Tony, who brings Web2 experience to a Web3 initiative, the project emphasises transparency, security, and member welfare. Lessons on trust, personal safety, and fraud mitigation are shared openly to strengthen collective defence against bad actors.  Outlook: $GOHOME  aspires to convert a cultural punchline into sustained social and economic value by combining scarcity, fair distribution, and disciplined community governance. It is positioned as a patient experiment in communal resilience rather than a speculative fad. The project explicitly rejects racism, violence, and manipulative practices; humor is used within clear ethical boundaries. Stakeholders are encouraged to consult the white paper and governance documents for technical specifics, and to engage with the community through official channels to assess risk and alignment with personal objectives.

The weaker dollar fits this environment. With the DXY around 96, this reflects a correction after years of strength rather than a crisis. A softer dollar improves export competitiveness, boosts foreign earnings, and may help narrow the trade deficit.

After a strong mid-2025 expansion phase marked by consistent positive quarterly returns, performance has turned negative in recent periods. This transition suggests the market has moved away from trend continuation and into a corrective or consolidation regime. Such shifts typically reflect weakening marginal demand rather than a structural breakdown, especially following an extended rally.\r \r Drawdown analysis provides further context. Current pullbacks are approaching deeper historical correction zones, levels more commonly associated with cyclical resets than full-scale bear market capitulation. Price remains below the 1-year average drawdown, indicating that downside pressure is no longer brief or opportunistic. This environment often coincides with reduced risk appetite and more selective capital deployment.\r \r Derivatives data reinforces this interpretation. The Futures Open Interest percent change oscillator shows repeated sharp contractions, signaling aggressive leverage unwinding. Large negative open interest shocks have consistently aligned with local price lows, implying that forced liquidations, rather than sustained spot selling, are driving recent volatility. This behavior is characteristic of leverage-driven corrections rather than broad capital flight.\r \r The 90-day Market versus Realized Price Gradient Oscillator points to fading macro momentum. The gradient has spent increasing time below its baseline and near lower deviation bands, reflecting a loss of bullish impulse relative to realized price. Historically, this configuration aligns with late-cycle cooling phases, where price action becomes range-bound while the market works to rebuild a healthier cost basis. A durable recovery would likely require leverage stabilization alongside renewed spot demand.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373300977","id":108425,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T07:00:05.985Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T07:00:05.985Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T06:58:19.430Z","text_content":"$13 BILLION IN LIQUIDATIONS WAITING FOR $BTC \r \r The chart is building pressure.

Entry confirmation would be a bullish pin bar or engulfing on the 1h/15m after the sweep. Stop-loss should be placed at the new swing low created by the sweep. - If price spikes above 91,225 and swiftly rejects, look for a short entry confirmation (bearish engulfing/pin bar) on lower timeframes, targeting first 88,900, then 87,300.

Gold and the S&P 500 are printing record highs, while Bitcoin is struggling to regain momentum, but on-chain data suggests this is fatigue and rebalancing, not a full-scale exit 💸\n\n\nTwo signals define the current pressure:\n\n\n📊 A deeply negative Coinbase Premium shows persistent U.S. selling, pointing to institutional deleveraging rather than retail panic\n📊 Stablecoin supply contraction confirms that some capital has temporarily moved back to fiat, reducing near-term “dry powder” for impulsive rebounds\n\n\nAt the same time, leverage metrics show repeated futures open interest resets, meaning recent volatility is driven more by liquidations than aggressive spot selling. This aligns with historical mid-to-late cycle cooling phases, where momentum fades before structure breaks\n\n\nImportantly, liquidity has not fully left crypto. Stablecoin ratios, exchange outflows, and DeFi activity suggest capital is waiting on clearer direction rather than funding the gold rally directly. This is diversification, not abandonment\n\n\nScenarios to watch:\n\n\n📉 Bearish: Continued institutional selling could pressure BTC toward structural supports (~$81K, $70K, worst-case $58K)\n\n\n🕯 Neutral/Base case: Sideways consolidation as the market absorbs supply and rebuilds liquidity\n\n\n📈 Bullish: Stablecoin inflows resume, leverage stabilizes, and spot demand returns, reigniting trend continuation\n\n\nBitcoin isn’t breaking, it’s pausing.

Glassnode points to the same issue every time: liquidity. Price held the $80.7K–$83.4K zone, yet upside stalls because buying depth isn’t there. Spikes without follow-through aren’t trends.  The tell is the profit/loss ratio. Historically, sustained recoveries only started when it stayed above its 90-day MA and pushed past ~5. Right now it’s near ~2 - signaling thin inflows, not renewed demand. Add supply pressure (≈22% of circulating BTC underwater, similar to 2018/2022 correction phases), and the setup explains why momentum keeps failing.  How I read this: downside looks limited while exchange inflows stay muted, but upside needs fresh capital - not just faster traders. What’s missing is structural liquidity, not speculative liquidity. This is where Wallet-as-a-Service and Crypto-as-a-Service models quietly matter: embedded wallets, business treasuries, payment and settlement flows bring capital that isn’t chasing candles and doesn’t exit on the first pullback. Infrastructure providers like WhiteBIT, building WaaS and CaaS rails for fintechs and businesses, are effectively expanding those non-speculative entry points - the kind of demand that tends to show up later, but actually sustains regimes rather than ranges.

Over the years, its price has followed a familiar rhythm shaped by just a handful of forces most importantly Bitcoin’s direction, supply changes from halvings, how busy the network is, and overall market mood. When you learn to watch these signals together, LTC’s moves become far easier to understand.  Bitcoin still sets the tone. With $LTC  tracking $BTC  close to nine times out of ten, rallies or pullbacks in Bitcoin usually echo quickly in Litecoin. That’s no accident both share similar mining systems and halving schedules, which is why LTC is often called “digital silver” next to Bitcoin’s gold.  Halvings are the next big driver. Every few years, Litecoin’s block rewards are cut in half, slowing new supply. Historically, LTC has tended to rally months before these events rather than after them, making the run-up phase especially important to watch as the 2027 halving approaches.  Usage matters too. Rising transaction counts, growing wallet numbers, and a strong hash rate signal real demand for the network. Litecoin’s fast blocks and low fees keep it practical for everyday transfers, which quietly supports long-term value.  Then there’s sentiment and the wider economy. Fear-and-greed cycles, interest-rate expectations, dollar strength, and ETF headlines can all sway price in the short termsometimes overpowering fundamentals for weeks at a time.  ﻿In conclusion LTC’s story in 2026 is about timing and context: follow Bitcoin, track supply cycles, watch on-chain activity, and keep an eye on macro trends. Do that, and you’re no longer guessing you’re reading the same signals the market responds to every cycle.  ﻿https://www.bitget.com/academy/litecoin-ltc-price-analysis  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"373309111","id":108774,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T10:30:05.804Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T10:30:05.804Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T10:27:11.945Z","text_content":"$BTC \nWe are so early. \nFor a brief window during the late 1970s, gold was actually more volatile than Bitcoin is today.\n​While we usually think of gold as a \"boring\" and stable asset, the period between 1979 and 1980 was a chaotic outlier. Here is how that era of gold stacks up against modern Bitcoin:\n​The Volatility Comparison\n​Gold (1979–1980): Following the end of the gold standard, gold's volatility spiked to over 80%. To put that in perspective, the price skyrocketed from around $226 in early 1979 to a peak of $850 in January 1980—a nearly 4x increase in just one year.  \n​Bitcoin (Today): While Bitcoin is famous for its \"wild\" swings, its annualized volatility has actually been maturing. In recent years (2024–2025), Bitcoin's volatility has frequently sat between 40% and 50%.   \n​The Verdict: If you were trading gold in 1979, you were experiencing a \"crypto-style\" ride. Gold was moving with the same (or greater) intensity as Bitcoin does now.\n​Why was gold so wild then?\n​Several \"perfect storm\" factors caused gold to behave like a speculative tech asset:\n​Massive Inflation: The U.S. was dealing with double-digit inflation, and people were panicking out of the dollar.\n​Geopolitical Chaos: The Iranian Revolution and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan created a global \"flight to safety\" that turned into a speculative frenzy.\n​Market Cornering: The Hunt Brothers famously tried to corner the silver market, which spilled over into gold, causing prices to decouple from reality.\nToday, gold has returned to its role as a \"steady\" asset with volatility usually around 15%, making it about 3–4x less volatile than Bitcoin. But in 1979, gold was the original \"wild child\" of the financial world.","gravity_id":"373306275","id":108775,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T10:30:05.988Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T10:30:05.988Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T10:24:45.160Z","text_content":"$13 BILLION IN LIQUIDATIONS WAITING FOR $BTC   The chart is building pressure.

They did not come to support the bull run. They came to control it.\n\n\nWhen price was pushed down aggressively, it was not because crypto “failed.” It was because confidence was attacked. Retail investors lost trust. Communities got shaken. Momentum was deliberately broken. That is how traditional finance kills organic growth. They slow it down, exhaust participants, then accumulate quietly at lower levels.\n\n\nCrypto has always been strongest when it belonged to the people. When the community believed, built, and held.

Historically, this metric tends to appear early in bear markets, as losses start affecting longer-term holders, not just short-term traders. Previous cycles — 2014, 2018, 2022 — saw prices continue lower even after this signal appeared. Currently, BTC is around $89.7K, below the key $90K mark, reflecting this uncertainty.  At the same time, macro conditions hint at potential upside. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is testing a historic zone near 96, a level that preceded the massive BTC rallies of 2017 and 2021. Historically, DXY weakness at this level allowed Bitcoin to surge multiple times over.  📌 Takeaway: On-chain data suggests early bearish structure, while the macro backdrop could support a bullish reversal. BTC might be preparing for a big move — direction remains anyone’s guess.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#  #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"373307426","id":108956,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T12:00:05.874Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T12:00:05.874Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T11:55:00.042Z","text_content":"📈 aBTC leads Bitcoin accumulation surge  aBTC leads Bitcoin buying amid a capital shift driven by AI-linked strategies  #yBTC  #Bitcoin  #AI  #Crypto  #Markets  $BTC    https://crypto-economy.com/abtc-leads-bitcoin-buying-amid-ai-driven-capital-shift/","gravity_id":"373310562","id":108957,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T12:00:06.506Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T12:00:06.506Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T11:54:19.689Z","text_content":"Symbol BTC  Price $87779.70  Market Cap $1.75T  Open Interest $59.23B  Funding Rate 0.0065%  24h Volume $74.23B  24h Liquidation $132.62M  Price Change(1h) -0.1600%  Price Change(24h) -2.2700%  RSI (1h/4h/1d) 36.27/41.39/41.17    Fear Greed Index 25/100  #Altcoin  Season Index 41/100    #crypto  $BTC","gravity_id":"373309559","id":108958,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T12:00:06.704Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T12:00:06.704Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T11:50:53.014Z","text_content":"🧠 What is your option when an “always-on” bank goes offline in the middle of a workday?  It's a special kind of irony. That’s what happened to me during a Monzo outage - I simply couldn’t send a basic P2P gift (not $BTC ... for now).  ❗Instead of waiting, I used WhiteBIT’s WB Check. It turns crypto into a separate “check” that already exists and can be claimed later. It’s not a real-time transfer that depends on a bank being online - but a standalone digital gift.  🟢 Creation took a couple of minutes: pick the asset, choose whether it’s revocable or not, confirm the amount with a small service fee - and the check is ready. You can send it as a link, QR code, or PDF. The recipient opens it, chooses a wallet, and claims the $BTC .  The check stays valid for up to five years, it isn’t tied to any specific bank, it feels like an actual gift rather than “just another transfer”, and it comes with multi-level security.  💯 Banks keep handling my bills. Gifts can travel on different rails.  👉 Read the full article to see the full flow and screenshots: https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/6978aacb7a682e1204dfe724/   #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373306709","id":108959,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T12:00:06.910Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T12:00:06.910Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T11:50:22.222Z","text_content":"Jacob & Co. and GoMining launched the Epic X GoMining: a ~$40,000 titanium luxury watch paired with a 1,000 TH/s NFT miner that earns daily $BTC  rewards through GoMining’s global data centers.

They represent ownership, creativity, and value on the blockchain. Every NFT has a story its creator, community, and utility. Some collections gain attention fast, others fade. If you’ve seen an NFT floor price jump overnight, you know how powerful on-chain markets can be, just like price moves seen in $BTC and $ZEC cycles.\n\nNFT Treasure is about spotting value early rare assets, strong communities, and real use cases. This is the same mindset used when identifying long-term value in assets like $BTC for digital scarcity and $ZEC for privacy-focused utility. Marketplaces are where this value is discovered through visibility, demand, and timing.\n\nTurning Opportunities Into Action\nKnowing NFTs isn’t enough. You need a place to explore, buy, and trade efficiently. Marketplaces help users act quickly when opportunities appear, similar to how traders react to market structure shifts across digital assets.\nThe Reality of NFT Trading\nNFT trading is emotional—hype during mints, pressure during pullbacks. Not every NFT becomes a treasure, and not every trade wins. Clear pricing, verified assets, and strong liquidity help reduce noise and improve decision-making.\n\nConclusion\nNFT Treasure represents creativity and potential Marketplaces connect these values by providing access, discovery, and clarity for users navigating on-chain markets.\n\nFAQ\nWhat makes an NFT valuable?\nRarity, utility, creator reputation, and community support.\nAre NFTs only digital art?\nNo. NFTs can represent music, videos, game items, memberships, and real-world assets.\nCan NFTs lose value?\nYes. Market demand changes, and not all NFTs hold long-term value.\nDo I need crypto to buy NFTs?\nYes. Most NFTs are bought using cryptocurrencies.\n\nSource: https://www.bitget.com/academy/top-nft-trading-platforms-to-buy-and-sell-nft-collections\n\n#CMC Quest: Earn Rewards# #Marco Insights#","gravity_id":"373306850","id":108986,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T12:20:05.746Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T12:20:05.746Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T12:16:49.918Z","text_content":"Gold?

The company attributed the decline to weaker conditions across the cryptocurrency market, reversing gains recorded over the prior two quarters.  \r \r That reduction translated into an unrealized paper loss of $307 million. Tesla emphasized that the loss did not stem from any asset sales, but rather from market-driven valuation changes.  \r \r While Tesla does not publicly disclose the exact composition of its digital assets, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence reported that the holdings consist entirely of Bitcoin. According to Arkham’s on-chain data, Tesla controlled 11,509 BTC at quarter-end, unchanged from the previous reporting period.  \r \r The valuation drop closely mirrored Bitcoin’s broader market performance.

They’ve got millions locked in \"alternatives\" that they can’t touch, can’t move, and can’t manage. They call it \"long-term strategy.\" I call it paying for a supercar and then leaving it in the garage without a battery.  If you’re a trader, this \"static\" mindset feels like slow suicide. It’s because in 2026, if your wealth isn't liquid, it’s not wealth - it’s just a number on a screen you can't use.  Honestly, I’m done with that. I needed my funds to be mobile, kept under my own control, and ready to move at a moment’s notice. That’s where WhiteBIT HNWI flips the script. It’s a specialized ecosystem for big capital where \"alternative investments\" actually stay alive.  How does it work? WhiteBIT HNWI is your all-in-one command center: - Crypto Lending: you can put your assets to work for up to 18.64% annually. Personally, I get the high yield of an \"alternative\" investment, but my money never goes into a coma - it stays ready for my next move. - On & Off-Ramping: High-limit SEPA transfers. You can seamlessly convert big chunks of fiat to crypto and back.  - Crypto Borrow: Need cash for a trade but don't want to sell your bag? Receive digital assets for any term to trade, transfer, or withdraw.  - VIP Trading Program: Lower fees that actually move the needle. When you’re trading high volumes, you stop paying the market and start getting rewarded by it.  At the end of the day, the difference between a wealthy person and a powerful trader is liquidity. Your money should be as fast as your brain.

Platforms like Bitget, along with Binance, OKX, Coinbase, Kraken, and Bybit, offer staking and savings products that help users earn returns on idle assets with less active involvement.  1. What Is Crypto Passive Income? It involves earning rewards by holding or locking crypto in staking or savings programs instead of trading frequently.  2. How Do Crypto Savings Work? Users deposit assets to earn interest through flexible or fixed-term plans, with higher returns usually tied to longer lock-ups.  3. Which Exchanges Support Passive Income? Bitget and other major exchanges provide staking and savings options, though supported coins and yields differ by platform.  4. What Risks Should Be Considered? Returns can change, and users should factor in market volatility, lock-up periods, and platform risk.  Conclusion: Crypto savings and passive income offer a simpler way to grow holdings. Choosing established platforms like Bitget and understanding product terms helps balance yield and risk.  FAQ  1. Are passive income returns guaranteed? No, yields vary with market conditions.  2. Can funds be withdrawn anytime? Only flexible products allow instant withdrawals.  3. Is staking risk-free? No, it still involves market and platform risks.  ﻿Source: https://www.bitget.com/academy/top-crypto-savings-accounts-for-earning-interest-with-high-apy  ﻿$BTC  $ETH  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373312229","id":109206,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:03.560Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:08.102Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T13:59:59.735Z","text_content":"$BTCCrypto Alpha Lab VIP Signals 🚀🚀\nPair: JUP/USDT\n\nPosition Size: 2%-5%\nLONG  Leverage CROSS 20x\n\nEntry Zone: 0.21 - 0.20664\n\nTargets: 0.21147 - 0.21315 - 0.21588 - 0.2184 - 0.2205 - 0.22365 - 0.2268 - 0.231","gravity_id":"373311268","id":109215,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:06.481Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:06.481Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T13:58:28.152Z","text_content":"Which Crypto Exchanges Do Not Report to the IRS?  Introduction In 2026, U.S. tax rules require custodial \"brokers\" (centralized exchanges serving U.S. users) to report digital asset & $BTC   transactions via Form 1099-DA for gross proceeds (from 2025 activity) and basis (phased in later). Common examples discussed in early 2026 include Bitget, Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Bisq, RoboSats, Hodl Hodl, and certain P2P marketplaces.  Which Platforms Are Exempt from IRS Reporting? Exemptions apply to non-custodial brokers (no possession of assets) and foreign CEXs not serving U.S. residents or lacking U.S. nexus. IRS final regulations (2024) exclude DEXs and non-custodial entities from 1099-DA requirements, while U.S.-based or U.S.-serving CEXs must comply.  How Do Key Platforms Compare on IRS Reporting? Early 2026 status based on IRS guidance, platform policies, and industry reports: - Bitget    • Foreign-based (no U.S. operations)     • Does not report user activity to IRS     • Users responsible for self-reporting taxes  - Uniswap    • Decentralized, non-custodial DEX     • No KYC or centralized reporting     • Transactions on-chain but no 1099 forms  - PancakeSwap    • Decentralized on BNB Chain  -    • Non-custodial with no IRS reporting     • Public blockchain visibility only.   Conclusion Bitget generally do not report to the IRS in 2026 due to lack of custody or U.S. jurisdiction, unlike U.S.-based exchanges (e.g., Coinbase) that issue 1099-DA. U.S. taxpayers must self-report all worldwide crypto activity regardless—non-reporting platforms do not eliminate tax liability or audit risk from blockchain analysis.   FAQ: Do all foreign exchanges avoid IRS reporting?  Most do if they restrict U.S. users and lack U.S. nexus, but users still owe taxes.  Are DEX transactions completely private from IRS?  No—on-chain data is public; IRS uses analytics for audits. 🔥Source: https://www.bitget.com/academy/which-crypto-exchanges-do-not-report-to-irs  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #BTC  #ETF","gravity_id":"373312242","id":109216,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:06.791Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:06.791Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T13:58:20.392Z","text_content":"$BTCSOL/USD BUY \n\nEntry : $ 122.89\n\nTarget1: $ 124\nTarget2: $ 127 \nTarget3: $ 131 \nTarget4: $ 134 \n\nSL : $ 120","gravity_id":"373313111","id":109217,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:07.105Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:07.105Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T13:58:02.724Z","text_content":"$BTC🟢LONG  #BTCUSDT\n\n🔶 Entry : 88000 - 88050\n\n➡️ Leverage : 25X\n\n🔥 Take Profit Targets :\n\n👉 89100\n\n🛑 Stop Loss : 86900","gravity_id":"373312239","id":109218,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:07.446Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:07.446Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T13:57:50.482Z","text_content":"$BTC💥 #BABY LONG ALERT 💥\n🌐 Entry: 0.01850\n 💬 Leverage 75X\n🎯 Targets:📥\n\nTP1: 0.01883 🔔\n\nTP2: 0.01935💵\n\nTP3: 0.02035 📈\n\n\n⛔️ Loss: 0.01745\n\n🔗 Stay ready traders — this move can fly high! 🌎🛡","gravity_id":"373313110","id":109219,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:07.757Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:07.757Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T13:57:30.295Z","text_content":"$BTCBABY LONG 0.01850 TP1 0.01883","gravity_id":"373308408","id":109220,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:07.934Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:07.934Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T13:56:22.323Z","text_content":"$BTC🟢$HYPE/USDT My LONG Trade\n      Setup\n    \n      Entry  -   33.554\n      Leverage 75X\n      Target - 34.000\n       SL  -   32.800","gravity_id":"373312227","id":109221,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:08.459Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:08.459Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T13:56:06.308Z","text_content":"$BTC#CYS/USDT","gravity_id":"373311253","id":109222,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:08.832Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T14:00:08.832Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T14:09:12.090Z","text_content":"🚨 Is a major crash coming for $BTC ❓  \r \r 💎 Follow us so you don't miss a thing  👉 https://t.me/+SrCUv2mw_9JjNGM8   #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin  #BTC","gravity_id":"373308493","id":109246,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T14:10:05.959Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T14:10:05.959Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T14:06:26.527Z","text_content":"Oh no, a \"manipulative entity\" is trying to keep $BTC  down. 🙄 Newsflash: Bitcoin doesn't need to be *helped*.

Those who stay calm and ignore the panic will benefit from long-term growth. Nothing—and no one—makes me nervous about the market.","gravity_id":"373312814","id":109418,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T15:20:06.542Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T15:20:06.542Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T15:17:27.788Z","text_content":"🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥    $210M longs REKT as BTC dipped below $86K. 💛    #crypto  $BTC","gravity_id":"373312810","id":109419,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T15:20:06.870Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T15:20:06.870Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T15:17:20.450Z","text_content":"🚨 JUST IN: $BTC DROPED BELOW $86,000","gravity_id":"373308971","id":109420,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T15:20:07.185Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T15:20:07.185Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T15:16:58.858Z","text_content":"Are we heading lower on $BTC ? ☄ Already at $85,000.

Now, with crypto markets more mature, regulated products expanding and institutions already involved, Atkins is signaling that crypto no longer belongs on the sidelines. \n\nEven a small allocation from 401(k) plans could mean meaningful exposure for millions of Americans and a major step toward mainstream adoption. Younger savers already see $BTC and other digital assets as part of the future, and this move would simply align retirement investing with that reality. \n\nThe idea that retirement accounts could finally reflect how the world actually stores and grows value today feels overdue.

Decision-making is fragmented, as member states protect their own interests, use vetoes, and move slowly toward consensus. Strict fiscal rules and deficit caps limit flexibility to invest in growth, infrastructure, defense, or innovation. In the Netherlands, for example, the new coalition maintains a maximum deficit of 2%, even as higher spending on healthcare, defense, and energy is inevitable. The result is a continent that struggles to respond quickly to global challenges like trade tensions, energy crises, and technological change. Europe’s inability to make unified decisions structurally limits opportunities for economic growth.\nThe US, by contrast, operates as one coherent economy with fast decision-making and clear priorities. This gives American companies a lasting advantage: they lead globally in tech, AI, innovation, and market growth. The economy grows steadily, consumers remain strong, and policy can adapt flexibly to change. For investors, this means focusing on US fundamentals is wise. Europe offers opportunities but remains vulnerable to political uncertainty and slow reform implementation. America remains the stable core in a volatile world market, while Europe can only become a serious competitor if it acts collectively, decisively, and with innovation at its core.","gravity_id":"373315033","id":109505,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T15:50:06.606Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T15:50:06.606Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T15:46:45.318Z","text_content":"Bitcoin is crashing.

I don’t treat it as free money - just short-term liquidity with a clear $BTC  price tag. Use it wrong once, and you can wipe out months of PnL.  ✅On WhiteBIT, I only use it in three cases: 1) Liquidity instead of selling $BTC  📈 When I need stables, I borrow ~3,000 USDT against ~15,000 USDT of BTC, keep LTV under 25%, and close within a week. At ~0.06% per day, that week costs ~12 USDT - often cheaper than mistiming a BTC sale.  2) Light leverage on planned trades 💰 I only go 1.2–1.5x. Before borrowing, I run the math: expected PnL after fees must be ≥3× the borrowing cost. If a 7-day loan costs 12 USDT, the trade has to target 40–50 USDT. If it doesn’t clear that bar, I skip.  3) Short arbitrage 🔥 If I see a 1–2% spread but liquidity is tied up, I borrow, execute both legs, and repay within hours. Entry, exit, and max loss are defined beforehand.  My rules are simple: only these three scenarios, LTV capped at 20–30%, no random overnight $BTC  leverage. That keeps Crypto Borrow on WhiteBIT a tool, not a permanent drag on returns.  🚨Keep your borrows efficient with WhiteBIT: fixed scenarios, fixed LTV, fixed time: https://whitebit.com/crypto-borrow?utm_source=coinmarketcap&utm_medium=wborrow&utm_campaign=post   #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373315594","id":109656,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T16:50:06.985Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T16:50:06.985Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T16:47:53.394Z","text_content":"$BTC just keep in mind there is a cme gap at 93k","gravity_id":"373315593","id":109657,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T16:50:07.323Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T16:50:07.323Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T16:47:20.677Z","text_content":"$BTC is showing early signs of pressure as long-term holders reduce exposure, putting $85K in the spotlight as a key support level.

It happens when price has already moved up and some of those early holders are simply taking profits. That’s normal behavior. It’s distribution into strength, not panic exits.\n\nThe real question isn’t whether long-term holders are selling. It’s whether the market can absorb that supply.\n\nRight now, that fight is happening around the 85K area. If price holds there, it tells you buyers are willing to step in and take what’s being sold. That’s usually how uptrends stay alive, supply changes hands, structure stays intact.\nIf 85K doesn’t hold, a move toward the 80K zone wouldn’t be surprising either. That area has history, it’s where price previously built acceptance. A dip there wouldn’t mean the cycle is broken. It would mean leverage gets cleaned out and stronger demand gets a better entry.\n\nThis doesn’t feel like fear-driven capitulation. It feels like a reset.
