Over the past days, spending from older wallets has picked up noticeably, which usually means early cohorts are selling into strength after the run to new highs. That supply is now meeting a more cautious market, with macro risk‑off and ETF flows no longer in “full send” mode.  Why 85K matters: • It’s a big psychological level and a clear pivot on the chart. • A lot of recent spot and ETF buyers are anchored around the mid‑80Ks. • Order books and open interest have been clustering in this zone.  From here, it’s basically two paths: • Scenario 1: 85K holds (or is quickly reclaimed). That would signal that institutions and dip‑buyers are absorbing long‑term holder supply, and BTC can chop in an 85–95K range while the market digests profit‑taking. • Scenario 2: Slow bleed toward 80K. If price accepts below 85K and bounces keep getting sold, the market will naturally probe the next liquidity pocket around 80K (and possibly the high‑70Ks) before stronger demand steps in.  Right now, the tape looks more like an ownership rotation than a full trend break: old coins moving to new hands, with 85K as the current line in the sand. Whether we bounce here or finish the move closer to 80K depends less on long‑term holders, and more on how aggressively fresh capital is willing to buy this dip.","gravity_id":"373319110","id":109841,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T18:10:05.832Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T18:10:05.832Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T18:09:08.495Z","text_content":"$BTC  SAME SHAPE DIFFERENT ANGLE ELEVATED 2nd Leg on stocks DEPRESSED 2nd Leg on Bitty $BTC    SIDE by SIDE","gravity_id":"373320138","id":109842,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T18:10:06.151Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T18:10:06.151Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T18:08:37.758Z","text_content":"$BTC   falls below $84,000  Bitcoin has broken below $84,000, triggering fresh concern across the market as a key support level gives way.

Looking at the SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for long-term holders, we are seeing dips below the 1.0 level. This indicates that \"old money\" is either locking in profits or, in some cases, selling near their cost basis due to macro uncertainty.  Global Context: Fed Policy: As of late January, the Federal Reserve's \"higher for longer\" stance on interest rates is creating a liquidity pinch, pushing investors away from risk-on assets like $BTC  ETF Momentum: The initial massive inflows into spot ETFs (like IBIT) have cooled down. We are now seeing a \"wait-and-see\" approach from institutional players, leading to a temporary vacuum in buy pressure.  Technical Outlook: 85K Support or 80K Bleed? $BTC  is currently fighting a survival battle at the $85,000 psychological level. If we analyze this through the lens of institutional price action:  1. The $85,000 Pivot (Order Block)This isn't just a round number; it’s a significant Order Block (OB). If $BTC  can hold this level, it confirms that institutional demand is strong enough to absorb the LTH sell-off. however, current momentum suggests the bears are pushing hard to break this defense.  2. The $80,000 Magnet (FVG & Liquidity)If $85K fails to hold, the price will likely be \"pulled\" toward the $80,000 – $82,000 range.   Here’s why: Liquidity Hunt: There is a massive cluster of long liquidations sitting just below $82K. Market makers often \"flush\" these levels to collect liquidity before a major move upward.  Fair Value Gap (FVG): On the daily and weekly charts, there is a prominent FVG between $80K and $82K. For a healthy trend continuation, the market often returns to \"rebalance\" these gaps.  Summary: Expect a battle at 85K, but don’t be surprised by a dip to 80K to grab liquidity. A sharp recovery from that level would be the most bullish signal for the next leg up.","gravity_id":"373320742","id":110090,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T20:00:07.911Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T20:00:07.911Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T19:50:16.616Z","text_content":"$BTC\n80K 😹😹😹 \nIt's not FINANCIAL ADVICE 🤭","gravity_id":"373319710","id":110091,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T20:00:08.243Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T20:00:08.243Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T20:09:52.181Z","text_content":"$BTC If we are really the boullish!?

Addresses to copy. Networks to double-check. Moments of hesitation before hitting “Send.” Even experienced users learned to slow down, because one wrong click could mean permanent loss.  Meanwhile, fintech quietly raised the bar. Apps like Revolut made moving money feel effortless - instant, intuitive, and almost invisible. And that contrast exposed crypto’s biggest weakness: not security, not scalability - usability.  That gap is finally starting to close.  As Kate Wilson describes, QuickSend from WhiteBIT reframes crypto transfers around how people actually behave. One tap. A nickname. An amount. No codes, no confirmations, no ritual. Funds land instantly on the recipient’s balance.  The experience feels less like “sending crypto” and more like sending a message. Transfers are saved as chat-style dialogues, repeat payments take seconds, and even Shake-to-Send turns nearby phones into instant payment rails.  👉 Read the full article by Kate Wilson: https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/69773cd874eab24fc4ccbe58/   So, real adoption doesn’t come from more features - it comes from fewer decisions.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#  #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"373318967","id":110130,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T20:20:07.636Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T20:20:07.636Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T20:11:48.831Z","text_content":"$BTC76000&73000$ then 1000000$🧨🚀🚀🚀🚀","gravity_id":"373319806","id":110131,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T20:20:07.846Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T20:20:07.846Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T20:11:18.416Z","text_content":"Bitcoin or Gold, which asset has gained more attention lately?  \r \r $BTC  has been trading in a range mostly $86k–$90k+ earlier this month, it faced pressure later in the month, dipping to 2026 lows around $83k.  \r \r $XAU  (gold) on the other hand has outperformed $BTC  dramatically, often adding massive value in single sessions while BTC consolidated or corrected.

I used to lose profit regularly because of technical lags: my bot would send a price request, then wait for a response… and in those split seconds, the market moved 0.5% against my position - crucial on my $5-7M daily volumes 📊  💭 That’s how I discovered WebSocket API actually resolves this issue by sending instant market updates - exactly what my strategy lacked. I gave it a try by joining WhiteBIT’s Market Making Program, and over the next month, I tracked how it affected performance:  ☑️ Slippage dropped by 40%: using FIX 4.4 and live streams means my bot now hits the real market, not an \"echo\" of it.  ☑️ PnL increased by 18%: the strategy now performs reliably even during sudden, violent market moves.  ☑️ Latency vanished: average order latency dropped from 150 ms to 12 ms, allowing the strategy to react in real time.  If your software is fast, the market pays you. If it’s slow, you pay the market.   🔥 Upgrade your trading experience with WhiteBIT’s reliable API and execute faster. https://institutional.whitebit.com/market-making-program?utm_source=coinmarketcap&utm_medium=websocketapi&utm_campaign=post   #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373322045","id":110144,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T20:30:06.515Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T20:30:06.515Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T20:26:05.867Z","text_content":"$BTC dump to $80K is to punish heavy leverage traders of their position. #BTC is at a heavy pressure position.\nA heavy dump to $80K might occur here if liquidity doesn't rotate back to the market, if $80K holds a light pump to $89K might occur in this zone.\n\n $BTC is oversold now by whales and institutions to suffer the retailers and leverage traders.

After consolidating near 5,200 dollars, the metal ripped above 5,500, then briefly flushed toward 5,150 before snapping back around 5,300. The message from the tape is clear: trend up, volatility up.\n\nMarket trends\n• From 5,200 base to 5,500 spike: between 26–29 January, gold moved from holding a new range around 5,200 dollars to printing fresh extremes near 5,595 on spot and about 5,626 on futures. The market is trading a new price zone.\n• Geopolitics still in the driver’s seat: the acceleration came on rising tension in the US–Iran story, with reports that the Trump administration is weighing a larger strike. The key tell: gold barely reacted to Fed noise, which means the “risk premium” narrative is dominating rate chatter.\n• Dollar and US politics as a backdrop, not a cap: through midweek, gold held near the highs even as some profit taking showed up. Political uncertainty in the US and renewed debate about future Fed policy, together with a softer dollar at times, kept investors parked in defensive trades.\n• Big money is still buying exposure: iShares Physical Metals issued a large new batch of 1,189,000 iShares Physical Gold ETC units (tranche 2426), on top of multiple smaller issues, including hedged lines. New paper at record prices is a strong signal that institutional demand is strategic.\n• Futures market running hot: CME reported very high daily volumes across the metals complex, with activity in the millions of contracts. That is typical of acceleration phases where both trend followers and short term traders crowd in.\n\nTechs\nThe last sessions turned the chart into a roller coaster:\nSupport: 5,150–5,200 dollars (zone of the sharp dip and prior consolidation)\nResistance: 5,550–5,600 dollars (recent spike band) and then 5,700 as a stretch target if momentum resumes\n\nThe fast drop toward 5,150 and rebound back above 5,300 underline that pullbacks can be violent but have been bought so far.\n\nEquities\nBroader equity markets are busy digesting the Fed path and big tech earnings, with US futures edging higher but sentiment still jumpy. Against that backdrop, gold is acting more and more like its own story.\n• Gold as an independent line: the metal pushed higher on geopolitical headlines even when the main talking point of the day was not macro data. That is classic “crisis hedge” behavior.\n• Mining names echo the move: volatility in producers and royalty names is picking up as investors look for leveraged ways to ride the gold tape. Strong single name moves in companies tied to the gold theme point to capital actively seeking “beta to bullion”.\n\nCrypto vs Gold\nThe gap in defensive behavior is widening.\n• In commentary around the move, the angle is simple: when uncertainty steps up, capital is rotating to instruments that look as robust and predictable as possible.\n• Part of the liquidity is leaving crypto. Shrinking stablecoin markets are one sign that risk appetite is being dialed down.\n• Inside crypto, more people are talking about bitcoin as a liquidity and trading tool than as a clean portfolio hedge, while gold is doing the classic “geopolitics up, price up” pattern almost tick for tick.\n\nWhat to watch\n• US–Iran headlines: any confirmation, denial, or escalation around potential US action is likely to move gold more than macro data in the short term.\n• Dollar trend: continued dollar weakness will amplify the move; a sharp dollar rebound could trigger fast but likely temporary dips.\n• ETF and ETC flows: ongoing issuance and inflows into physically backed products remain the cleanest gauge of long term demand.\n• CME volumes and volatility: sustained high turnover supports the current acceleration phase; a drop in volume on new highs would be an early warning of a topping attempt.\n\nTakeaways\n• Gold: the shift from holding 5,200 to spiking above 5,500 shows a market priced on risk premia, not just technical levels. The base case is still a bullish cycle with jagged corrections driven by headlines rather than a smooth grind. Strategy: keep core exposure, and only consider adding on sharp pullbacks if the geopolitical backdrop has not genuinely cooled.\n• Gold linked instruments: continued expansion in physically backed ETC lines confirms institutional sponsorship. This looks less like a one off overshoot and more like the market building a new range above previous all time highs.\n• Crypto: for now, the watchword is patience. Gold is clearly behaving like the primary shock absorber, while crypto remains more sensitive to liquidity swings and sentiment and offers no guaranteed protection in stress phases.\n\nNot financial advice.

But what if many of those losses were preventable?  What destroyed accounts that day wasn’t direction. It was speed.  The market repriced faster than $BTC  traders could react. Liquidity vanished, margin requirements shifted, correlations spiked - while many were still watching dashboards refresh. In fast markets, risk doesn’t wait. Liquidation engines act instantly; humans don’t.  ✅ That day confirmed why I use the WhiteBIT Market Making Program as part of my risk architecture, not just for liquidity. When you stop and look at the numbers - $2.7T in annual trading volume and a $50B market cap - it becomes clear this is not occasional liquidity.  The difference appeared inside the account, not on the chart.  ▪️ Instead of running everything on one balance, I used WhiteBIT sub-accounts to isolate strategies. Each had its own margin and limits, so losses stayed local. ▪️ Webhook notifications delivered the time edge. Balance and margin changes were pushed instantly via API, early enough to reallocate margin while the system was still stable. The result wasn’t zero losses. There was no cascade.

But this isn’t just about levels — it’s about structure and sentiment.  We’ve seen:  A sharp pullback into layered support zones.  A consolidation phase that’s holding above the ascending trendline.  A potential breakout brewing toward the $0.665 zone.  But here’s the real insight: Momentum isn’t just technical — it’s psychological.   ASTER’s recent behavior reflects a market that’s testing conviction. Buyers are defending structure, but volume hasn’t confirmed intent yet. This is where traders get trapped chasing candles instead of setups.  What matters now: Patience > Prediction: Let price prove itself above $0.630 before chasing.  Structure > Emotion: The trendline is your compass. If it breaks, sentiment shifts.  Zones > Noise: $0.597–$0.612 is the real battleground. Everything else is just noise until this range resolves.

Not some big player messing around—it's a full-market cleanup. Trading bots freaked out over a strong yen, dumping $429M in bets fast. Total wipeouts hit $786M, mostly folks betting on a rise. Mood swung to pure panic, fear gauge at 25. Real buyers disappeared, turning a small dip into a flood.  Big fact: 63% of owners bought over $88K—they're losing money and will sell if it bounces, blocking any quick recovery. $88K now blocks upside; hold $80.4K or bust; aim for $75K, matching a key long-term average.  Views breakdown: - Bot blamers: Machines sped it up, but didn't start it. - Big-picture folks: Strong dollar, tough Fed, shaky stocks kill risk-taking—Bitcoin's acting like a gamble, not safety. - Chart watchers: Patterns broke, signals weak—heading down. - Bargain hunters: Stats look cheap, but wait for calm and real buying.  Futures market shows: Rates steady but bets piled high, leading to mass selling at cost. Weekly trend flipped bad—speed's gone. No lone villain; everyone's cutting risk.  My move: Wait till it hits $85K with strong buying. Expect drop to $75-78K for better spots.  Wrap: Risk-averse times; more pain ahead.

When crypto cools off, capital rotates. Inflation, interest rates, and global uncertainty are driving gold right now, and the price action shows it. Assets like $XAUt  respond more clearly to these macro forces than most altcoins.  I didn’t replace crypto I balanced it. Gold helped me stay active, manage risk, and avoid overtrading during slower crypto phases.  The Bitget UEX upgrade made it seamless. I can track crypto and trade gold in one place. I’m still long-term bullish on crypto, but now I’m more intentional about where and when I deploy capital.  If your market is quiet, don’t force trades. Follow the rotation.

Unlike the 17th-century tulip mania, which collapsed after only three years and never recovered, Bitcoin has survived for 17 years and rebounded from multiple crashes of 70–90% to reach new highs.\nKey Differences in 2026\n * Institutional Adoption: Bitcoin is now a global asset integrated into financial systems through ETFs and corporate treasuries.\n * Scarcity: Unlike tulips, which can be grown in unlimited quantities, Bitcoin’s supply is hard-capped at 21 million.\n * Historical Resilience: Bitcoin has weathered \"six or seven\" major market cycles, whereas the tulip bubble was a one-time local event.\nThe recent 2026 low below $85,000 is viewed by many as a standard market correction rather than a terminal \"burst.\"\nAs of today, Thursday, January 29, 2026, Bitcoin is experiencing significant volatility, but the \"Tulip Bubble\" narrative is once again being challenged by the high level of institutional involvement that simply didn't exist in the 1630s.\n​Here is the current market breakdown:\n​1. Current Price Action\n​Bitcoin has seen a sharp decline today, dropping over 5.5% to trade around $84,000.\n​Intraday Low: ~$83,259\n​Market Context: This is the lowest level since November 2025. The price is currently down about 33% from its all-time high of $126,272 reached in October 2025.\n​Today's Driver: Markets are reacting to a broader \"risk-off\" sentiment affecting tech stocks (due to AI spending concerns) and uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve interest rate policy.\n​2. ETF Inflow/Outflow Data\n​The \"institutional shield\" is showing some cracks this week, which is fueling the current dip:\n​Weekly Outflows: Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $1.1 billion in net outflows between January 20 and January 26.\nThe Verdict\n​While the price drop feels painful, most analysts view this as a cyclical correction rather than a bubble burst.","gravity_id":"373323359","id":110316,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T22:20:07.733Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T22:30:07.987Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T22:07:45.253Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\n#Bitcoin holds $84,000 — for now — but analysts warn of drop to $70,000 if support fails\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"373323344","id":110317,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T22:20:08.062Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T22:20:08.062Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T22:07:19.951Z","text_content":"Someone tell me…..\n\n\nHow did $BTC GET BACK TO 84K\n\n\nARE WE NOT BACK YET???","gravity_id":"373323341","id":110318,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T22:20:08.444Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T22:20:08.444Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T22:07:00.118Z","text_content":"UPDATE: 💰 Dubai Insurance launches crypto wallet for premiums & claims payments in   $BTC, in partnership with Zodia Custody.\n#Cryptolnsurance #Bitcoin #UAE","gravity_id":"373325115","id":110319,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T22:20:08.774Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T22:20:08.774Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T22:30:03.510Z","text_content":"$BTC   for gold could be same senario in 16-01-2026  was also in friday  and the same move exactly  if you know what is day RANGE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING","gravity_id":"373330059","id":110328,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T22:30:05.289Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T22:40:07.223Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T22:24:51.371Z","text_content":"$BTC   i am trying to find you entering trade or trend line  first one : GREEN TREND LINE  second : RED TREND LINE  IF BOTH NO  entering will be 38-41-50-67-73 from deep down to near support","gravity_id":"373330026","id":110329,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T22:30:05.628Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T22:40:07.421Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-29T22:21:35.690Z","text_content":"Bukele buying the dip.

Price is merely the result of capital games, but consensus is the reason for its long-term existence.

As $BTC  digests the latest macro signals, billionaire investor Jeffrey Gundlach said Bitcoin has lost its shine - and 2026 won’t bring relief from the Fed.  🏦 Gundlach pointed to performance. Over the past 12 months, gold is up around 90%, while Bitcoin is down over the same period. To him, that shift reflects a move away from “hype” and back toward tangible assets.  📌 He backed it with a classic line from Jim Grant: “The price of gold is the reciprocal of investors’ confidence in central banking.” In other words, less trust → higher gold.  🧾 Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell kept rates steady at 3.5%–3.75% and offered no forward guidance. Gundlach summed it up bluntly, quoting Powell’s repeated answer: “I got nothing for you on that.”  🔍 His takeaway is clear. No more rate cuts are coming in 2026, at least under Powell. For BTC, that means the macro headwind isn’t gone - and the next move will depend less on narratives, more on liquidity and patience.  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373325939","id":110452,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T00:30:05.543Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T00:40:07.271Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T00:24:04.357Z","text_content":"$BTC\n\n\nSo tired of winning","gravity_id":"373325913","id":110453,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T00:30:05.873Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T00:40:07.591Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T00:22:26.064Z","text_content":"It's impressive to see someone spotlighting the actual on-chain data rather than just staring at the 1-hour candles.

Here is an example of what I think institutional panic looks like and were not there yet this is just inexperienced retail getting wrecked.","gravity_id":"373331759","id":110650,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T03:10:05.883Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T03:10:05.883Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T03:07:17.382Z","text_content":"$BTC  NEXT 100X 🐸 GOING TO DCA MOON","gravity_id":"373331747","id":110651,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T03:10:06.211Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T03:10:06.211Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T03:06:45.924Z","text_content":"$BTC  Bitcoin Has Just Printed A New 12 Hour Heikin Ashi Candle & It Printed Red [Bearish].\n\n EMA Lines: 20 EMA [Yellow], 50 EMA [Orange], 100 EMA [White], 200 EMA [Purple].\n\n Meaning We May Have More Possible Downside Or Sideways Shuffle Still Coming 😁👌 Just Letting Yall Know 😁👌","gravity_id":"373329928","id":110652,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T03:10:06.565Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T03:10:06.565Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T03:06:00.020Z","text_content":"#BTC  $BTC LONG TRADE \n\nENTRY: 82000\n\nTARGET: 85000, 90000\n\nSTOP LOSS: 79500","gravity_id":"373329920","id":110653,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T03:10:06.904Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T03:10:06.904Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T03:05:52.988Z","text_content":"$BTC not many multi billion dollar corporations are willing to invest into something that causes them to lose 25% of their funds in a 90 day span.

That was Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, and BTC literally wicked to precisely $74,420.69 on @Coinbase. You can’t make this shit up. As likely as it is to warrant a bounce, I’ll be very surprised if BTC doesn’t ultimately end up grinding lower than $74k unless we get a great catalyst or it takes most of the year to get there.  2021 Top at $69k is attractive to me. We consolidated in that zone for 8 months, and it would represent a complete retrace of the Trump Pump that began on Election Day. I’ll like it a lot more if it takes until August to grind down that low. If we sprint down there in February, the $50k range will look more interesting to me later in the year.   I could be wrong.

The recent Long-Term Holder (LTH) activity is a strong signal, with Glassnode data showing more than 370,000 $BTC  moved by long-term wallets this month, which clearly indicates distribution pressure.  The $85K level stands out as a critical support zone, especially since it aligns with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement and the major consolidation area from late last year.  However, a temporary dip toward $80K still seems likely before any sustainable recovery. While ETF inflows are providing some support, they may not be enough to fully absorb selling from whales and miners, who are currently under revenue pressure.  Overall, the market may need a deeper pullback below $85K to clear out overleveraged longs before setting up for the next meaningful move higher.

These holders have historically been strong support for price during corrections, so their shift to distribution has raised questions about where $BTC  goes next.  The first key level to watch is 85,000 dollars. This area has acted as a floor in recent sessions, and buyers have stepped in here before to absorb selling pressure. If 85K holds on decent volume, it suggests demand is still present and that the market may stabilise around current levels.  If price breaks below 85,000 and fails to find immediate bids, the next major support zone comes into view around 80,000. That area reflects longer-term accumulation and could attract interest from buyers looking for value if sentiment weakens further.  Ultimately, how price reacts in the coming sessions will guide the near-term trend. Holding 85K would indicate that recent selling might be absorbed, while a move toward 80K would signal that downside pressure is gaining strength. Traders will be watching volume and order flow around these levels to gauge how confident buyers remain.","gravity_id":"373333405","id":110817,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T04:50:06.852Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T04:50:06.852Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T04:45:43.827Z","text_content":"$BTC  shaking out the weak hands.

This was a \"hedging-dominated\" regime where dealer positioning acted as a shock absorber, dampening volatility in both directions.\n\nThe Release: Today, roughly a third of that near-dated gamma rolls off (representing over $8.3B in notional open interest on Deribit alone). This doesn't guarantee a direction, but it removes the guardrails. We are transitioning from a pinned/stable regime to a high-sensitivity regime.\n\nThe Vanna Effect: As spot price slid toward $82k, the spike in Implied Volatility (IV) forced dealers to sell spot to stay delta-neutral (Negative Vanna). This is why the drop feels like a \"trap door\", it’s a mechanical accelerant, not necessarily a change in fundamental conviction.\n\n2. What the Media is Missing: Selective Liquidity Sourcing\nThe mainstream story is \"Bitcoin is failing while Gold is flying.\" The first-principles story is about which assets are most \"saleable\" in a crisis.\n\nPrecious Metals Reversal: Gold and silver just printed record nominal highs (Gold recently touched $5,600+ in futures) before snapping back sharply today. Investors are fleeing to safety, but they are also facing a liquidity crunch.\n\nThe Liquid Sacrifice: While institutional ETF inflows reached $1.4 billion earlier this month, \n\n#What is your Bitcoin Price Prediction?# #Btc #crypto","gravity_id":"373333390","id":110819,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T04:50:07.401Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T04:50:07.401Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T04:45:16.534Z","text_content":"You can't convince me that Bitcoin $BTC is going lower than $81k when there's this much demand at current levels and we have a triple bullish divergence on the 8hr","gravity_id":"373333388","id":110820,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T04:50:07.626Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T04:50:07.626Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T04:44:38.065Z","text_content":"Looks like $BTC is going to drop to $79k\n\n\nThen bounce back\n\n\nBookmark this tweet.\nLink in bio","gravity_id":"373333384","id":110821,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T04:50:07.965Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T04:50:07.965Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T04:44:26.465Z","text_content":"$BTC TRUST AN STABILITY ARE WE LACKING IN THE SPACE REGS WILL GAVE US THAT AND BRING IN MORE BUYERS THAN BTC AND THE INDUSTRY COULD HANDLE IM TELLING YOU GUYS THE KEY ISSUE WE HAVE IS TRUST IN THE SPACE","gravity_id":"373333383","id":110822,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T04:50:08.289Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T04:50:08.289Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T04:44:17.561Z","text_content":"$BTC Here's the thing though - at some point people are going to be SO confident placing their shirt positions and you think the manipulation is going to stop then?","gravity_id":"373333382","id":110823,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T04:50:08.614Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T04:50:08.614Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T04:56:11.374Z","text_content":"$BTC is consolidating within a tight range, reflecting short-term indecision as traders await a catalyst.

The \"major dump\" you referred to is a reality: long-term holders (LTHs) have distributed approximately 370,000 $BTC  over the last 30 days. This selling pressure, combined with over $1.1 billion in weekly ETF outflows and a rotation of capital into record-breaking gold and silver, has shifted the immediate momentum toward a \"bleed\" scenario.  Key Levels to Watch 1. Current Support ($82K – $83K): This is the current \"battleground.\" If $BTC   cannot reclaim $85K quickly, analysts expect it to test the lower boundary of its multi-month consolidation range.  2. The \"Bleed\" Target ($80K): A dip to $80K is highly likely if the $82.8K structural marker (the 2-year Simple Moving Average) is broken. Most technical models suggest that a drop below $81K would trigger a \"capitulation zone,\" potentially pushing prices toward $74K.  3. Resistance ($88K – $91K): BTC needs to reclaim $88.5K to invalidate the current bearish \"rising wedge\" pattern.   The evidence suggests BTC is more likely to bleed toward $80K than hold $85K in the immediate term, as \"accumulation fatigue\" from long-term holders has left the market's buy-side defense thin.  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373333633","id":110876,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T05:30:07.159Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T05:30:07.159Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T05:25:45.058Z","text_content":"Binance announced that it will adjust the asset structure of its SAFU Fund, gradually converting the original $1 billion stablecoin reserves into Bitcoin reserves, with the conversion to be completed within 30 days from the date of this announcement.

On Thursday, President Donald Trump said he will announce his pick for the U.S. Federal Reserve chair to replace incumbent Jerome Powell after the latter's term ends in May.  While nothing is confirmed yet, reports suggest the Trump administration is preparing to nominate Kevin Warsh, who served on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011.    Warsh has occasionally praised cryptocurrencies. Yet bitcoin \r BTC\r plunged late Thursday to near $81,000 lows as his odds spiked on betting sites, with some analysts now pegging him as a bearish force for the asset.\r \r \"Markets generally view a resurgence of Warsh's influence as bearish for Bitcoin, as his emphasis on monetary discipline, higher real rates, and reduced liquidity frames crypto not as a hedge against debasement but as a speculative excess that fades when easy money is withdrawn,\" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, told CoinDesk.  Higher real interest rates mean the actual cost of borrowing money after accounting for inflation is elevated. Think of it as the \"true\" interest rate that hits your finances harder. When real rates are elevated, businesses and investors typically scale back exposure to risky investments such as bitcoin.  Warsh's track record is adding fuel to the fire. During the global financial crisis (GFC) that lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, Warsh repeatedly cited inflation risks even as the global economy teetered on the brink of a full-blown deflation.  For instance, in September 2008, the month when Lehman Brothers collapsed, Warsh said, \"I'm still not ready to relinquish my concerns on the inflation front.\"","gravity_id":"373334276","id":110976,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T06:30:07.662Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T06:30:07.662Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T06:26:09.166Z","text_content":"$BTC📊#BAN/USDT\n\n✅ LONG ( LEV-20X )\n\nENTRY :- 0.0787 - 0.076\n\nTake Profit:- \n\n1)> 0.0795\n2)> 0.082\n3)> 0.086\n\n🟩 STOP :- 0.073\n\nPublished by","gravity_id":"373335095","id":110977,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T06:30:07.912Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T06:30:07.912Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T06:25:45.280Z","text_content":"Analyst Benjamin Cowen warns Bitcoin may face prolonged struggles against the stock market, shattering hopes for a swift recovery.\n\n📖 Read more: https://coin.news/opinion/bitcoins-bleeding-continues-as-analysts-warn-of-misplaced-hopes/","gravity_id":"373335092","id":110978,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T06:30:08.132Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T06:30:08.132Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T06:25:45.166Z","text_content":"$BTC fell over 5% in 24h, sliding from above $89K to near $84K, the deepest drop since April 2025.  \n\nOver $429M liquidated in 1 hour, ETF flows turned negative, total crypto down ~4%.\n👇\nhttps://blockinsider.com/crypto/bitcoin-tumbles-amid-volatility-drops-to-84000-in-deepest-slump-since-april-2025/ ","gravity_id":"373335088","id":110979,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T06:30:08.458Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T06:30:08.458Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T06:38:24.095Z","text_content":"#Bitcoin  80,000$    BTC    #crypto  $BTC","gravity_id":"373334366","id":110985,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T06:40:06.000Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T06:40:06.000Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T06:37:45.114Z","text_content":"JUST IN: Binance to convert its entire $1B SAFU user protection fund from stablecoins to Bitcoin within the next 30 days.\n\nIf BTC price volatility causes the fund to fall below $800M, Binance will top up with additional Bitcoin to restore it to $1B. \nSource: ","gravity_id":"373335176","id":110986,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T06:40:06.328Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T06:40:06.328Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T06:37:45.085Z","text_content":"NEW YORK, October 15, 2025 – Bitcoin faces immediate downward pressure today as financial markets react to growing speculation that former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh could become the next Fed Chair.\nhttps://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-warsh-fed-chair-pressure/ ","gravity_id":"373334354","id":110987,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T06:40:06.690Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T06:40:06.690Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T06:36:45.665Z","text_content":"$BTC  — BREAKDOWN FROM DISTRIBUTION RANGE  Bitcoin failed to hold the upper boundary of its consolidation range and triggered a sharp breakdown from structure.

This move was fast and heavy in volume, which usually signals capitulation selling rather than a calm trend continuation. After reaching this zone, BTC showed a clear reaction with buyers stepping in, long lower wicks, and a noticeable slowdown in selling pressure. This tells us that the 81k–81.5k area is a strong demand zone where buyers are willing to defend price.\n\nFollowing the reaction from 81k, BTC bounced toward the 82.8k–83k range and is now trying to stabilize. This recovery should be seen as a relief bounce, not a confirmed trend reversal. On the higher timeframe, BTC is still trading below major resistance and moving averages, so the broader structure remains weak. However, as long as price holds above 81k, the immediate risk of another straight dump is reduced.\n\nFrom here, the lower zone is the most important area to watch. If BTC continues to hold above 81k–81.5k, price can slowly grind higher toward 83.8k–84.5k. A clean break above that area could allow a push toward 85.5k–86.5k, where stronger selling pressure is expected. These upside levels should be treated as reaction zones, not automatic bullish continuation.\n\nOn the downside, a loss of 81k with strong volume would invalidate the bounce idea. In that case, BTC could quickly move toward 79.5k–80k, as stops below support get triggered. That level would then become the next area to watch for a reaction.\n\nIf you are already in a long from lower prices, it makes sense to stay patient while BTC holds above 81k. Do not hold longs if 81k breaks. If you are in a short, this is not an ideal area to add more.\n\nMarket sentiment remains cautious after the drop, which actually supports consolidation or a short-term bounce. This is a market that rewards patience and level-based decisions, not chasing moves. Let price confirm direction and react calmly.","gravity_id":"373334331","id":110992,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T06:40:08.054Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T06:40:08.054Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T06:33:34.469Z","text_content":"$BTC And some of you still think this cycle will top by 125-140k per BTC 😂🤡 Subtract 100 guys, then you get the right number… Same patterns as 2022! 👎","gravity_id":"373334330","id":110993,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T06:40:08.381Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T06:40:08.381Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T06:33:15.902Z","text_content":"Once Michael Saylor sells off    9,800$ #Bitcoin     #crypto   BTC  $BTC","gravity_id":"373335145","id":110994,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T06:40:08.704Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T06:40:08.704Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T06:49:53.665Z","text_content":"$BTC Get out of the market now!

Shock in crypto: TA patterns actually worked. Recently, I assumed we’d exit the bear flag as a bear trap—meaning upward—but it didn’t happen, no luck. Someone’s hand trembled over the red button again.  Crypto, of course, isn’t the only thing that got dumped. Gold is starting to look like some shitcoin that got pumped and then dumped—something weird is going on with the markets. I don’t see any real “investment” trends anymore—only the quick dopamine hit from derivative trading.  Unfortunately, we’re already in a world where our $20 in futures can disappear before we even notice. When you see these wild “whales” dumping several million at once, you’re just left in shock. It’s obvious, of course, that it’s these liquidations they’re hunting—what does a market maker care about our $20? We’re just on the same side as the “whales” with $100 million. Even in stocks, precious metals, and funds—there are secret handshakes; if you didn’t shake hands, you’ve basically lost.  For $BTC , I still expect a sweep of the previous low, but there’s a large order at the level we bounced from. If selling pressure increases, we could see another squeeze by tonight. I don’t see a reversal opportunity yet—deltas are negative, OI is rising, but this isn’t a potential reversal; it’s a pattern that could indicate mounting seller pressure. If you have futures positions, it’s better to cut your losses. The timing isn’t favorable if you look at the news backdrop.  P.S.

For active market participants tracking these shifts, platforms like BingX offer the tools and liquidity needed to navigate Bitcoin’s evolving structure with precision and discipline.\n\n\n@Bitx_Global_Exchange @CoinMarketCap @noiseGPT\n\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#\n $BTC","gravity_id":"373335677","id":111098,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T07:40:05.710Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T07:40:05.710Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T07:38:37.887Z","text_content":"$CHECK is cooking seriously despite the dip of $BTC\n\n\n$CHECK is now on Bitmart Exchange and as you would expect, the price went from .06 to .08\n\n\nThere’s a trading competition for $CHECK on Bitmart\n\n\nThe reward pool is 62500 $CHECK\n\n\nMore details here:\n\n\nhttps://bitmart.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/46020563563547-CHECK-Listing-Celebration-Share-62-500-CHECK-in-Prizes\n\n\n#exchangelisting #priceanalysis","gravity_id":"373335666","id":111099,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T07:40:05.957Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T07:40:05.957Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T07:38:03.868Z","text_content":"🚀ALERT: #Crypto  market in extreme fear while lower-side liquidity is fully swept — downside stops cleared. 🧹  $BTC","gravity_id":"373335663","id":111100,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T07:40:06.285Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T07:40:06.285Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T07:37:43.304Z","text_content":"$BTC   Bears are euphoric at $83,000, similar to how bulls were euphoric at $97,000  inverse positions within the range.

More investors are now using crypto as a tool to earn ongoing returns and store value, allowing assets to grow with minimal daily effort. $BTC is often considered a core long-term holding in this space.\n\nHow Does Passive Income in Crypto Work?\nPassive income in crypto is generated by putting assets to use through options like staking, lending, or contributing to blockchain operations. Instead of frequent trading, users can earn rewards by holding or strategically allocating their digital assets.\n\nUsing Crypto for Long-Term Savings\n\nCrypto savings focus on growing digital assets through interest-earning products and reward-based platforms. While these options may offer higher returns compared to traditional savings methods, they also involve exposure to price changes and platform-related risks.\n✅️ Key Risks to Consider\n✅️ Market volatility can impact asset prices\n✅️ Crypto platforms do not provide government-backed protection\n✅️ Higher reward potential often means increased risk\nUnderstanding the product is crucial before committing funds\n\nConclusion\nCrypto passive income and savings offer new ways to build financial growth in the digital age, but they require careful research, risk awareness, and discipline. A balanced strategy combined with a long-term perspective can help users navigate this space responsibly.\n\nFaq\nWhat is crypto passive income?\nEarning rewards by holding or allocating crypto, without active trading.\nIs active trading required?\nNo. Returns can be earned through long-term holding strategies.\nAre there risks involved?\nYes.

Shock in crypto: TA patterns actually worked. Recently, I assumed we’d exit the bear flag as a bear trap—meaning upward—but it didn’t happen, no luck. Someone’s hand trembled over the red button again.  Crypto, of course, isn’t the only thing that got dumped. Gold is starting to look like some shitcoin that got pumped and then dumped—something weird is going on with the markets. I don’t see any real “investment” trends anymore—only the quick dopamine hit from derivative trading.  Unfortunately, we’re already in a world where our $20 in futures can disappear before we even notice. When you see these wild “whales” dumping several million at once, you’re just left in shock. It’s obvious, of course, that it’s these liquidations they’re hunting—what does a market maker care about our $20? We’re just on the same side as the “whales” with $100 million. Even in stocks, precious metals, and funds—there are secret handshakes; if you didn’t shake hands, you’ve basically lost.  For $BTC , I still expect a sweep of the previous low, but there’s a large order at the level we bounced from. If selling pressure increases, we could see another squeeze by tonight. I don’t see a reversal opportunity yet—deltas are negative, OI is rising, but this isn’t a potential reversal; it’s a pattern that could indicate mounting seller pressure. If you have futures positions, it’s better to cut your losses. The timing isn’t favorable if you look at the news backdrop.

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and certain foreign centralized exchanges (e.g., Bitget) generally do not report user activity to the IRS. Important: All U.S. taxpayers must self-report and pay taxes on worldwide crypto gains and income regardless of forms received. The IRS expands enforcement via blockchain analytics and global cooperation. Non-reporting platforms offer privacy, but no tax exemption. Always track and report; ignorance isn't a defense.  Non-Reporting Exchanges in 2026: Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), eg. Uniswap, PancakeSwap, 1inch.  Non-U.S.-Based Centralized Exchanges, e.g, Bitget, OSL (Hong Kong). No IRS reporting obligation if they restrict U.S. users. Users must comply with local tax rules. P2P / OTC Platforms Examples: Hodl Hodl, Binance P2P, Pexpay. Direct trades, no custody, typically no IRS forms (some light verification possible). You Still Owe Taxes U.S. residents must report all taxable events (sales, swaps, staking/mining/airdrops rewards) even on non-reporting platforms.

Kevin Warsh is now the clear favorite to replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair, with prediction markets pricing his nomination above 90%. The reaction was instant: a stronger dollar, rising Treasury yields and renewed pressure on risk assets.  For crypto, the signal is mixed.  On one hand, Warsh is seen as more hawkish than Powell, favoring tighter policy and fiscal discipline. That’s not great for short-term liquidity narratives, especially while $BTC  keeps failing near the $90K zone.  On the other hand, Warsh has publicly stated that Bitcoin “doesn’t trouble” the Fed and can act as market discipline rather than a threat. That’s a very different tone from the usual central bank rhetoric.  Net result so far: Macro stays tight, liquidity expectations get pushed out - but Bitcoin’s political and regulatory narrative quietly improves.  Short-term pressure, long-term clarity.

While traditional markets and Bitcoin are seeing \"risk-off\" volatility, the Real-World Asset (RWA) sector is telling a different story of resilience.\n1. The Macro Standoff 📉 The Senate remains deadlocked over the Department of Homeland Security funding bill. Unlike previous years, the 2026 market is no longer treating a shutdown as mere political theater. Bitcoin has slipped toward the $84,000 range as institutional investors de-risk from volatile assets in the face of Treasury Department furloughs.\n\n2. The RWA Rotation 🔄 While pure digital assets are seeing outflows, tokenized RWAs (Real-World Assets) are emerging as the preferred safe haven. Why?\n\nTransparency: On-chain assets like Sproutly's verified carbon removals don't rely on \"government uptime\" for valuation.\n\nPhysical Backing: As the US Dollar faces short-term uncertainty, investors are rotating into assets with \"Biological Alpha\" - tangible commodities verified by independent satellites (dMRV).\n\n3. Carbon Pricing Resilience 🌿 Despite the chaos in D.C., the EU Carbon Market remains a rock of stability.

If uncertainty persists, they slow. If they slow, the structural support weakens.   Although $BTC  is unlikely to be destroyed, it can fracture the supercycle narrative into a longer, choppier timeline.    #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373342144","id":111327,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T09:40:06.862Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T09:40:06.862Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T09:32:53.270Z","text_content":"$BTCc","gravity_id":"373342142","id":111328,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T09:40:07.216Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T09:40:07.216Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T09:32:50.702Z","text_content":"$BTCf","gravity_id":"373341155","id":111329,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T09:40:07.544Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T09:40:07.544Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T09:32:11.702Z","text_content":"$BTC short all the way @ 72K","gravity_id":"373342136","id":111330,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T09:40:07.966Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T09:40:07.966Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T09:30:44.178Z","text_content":"$BTC that's what happens when you act smart with your Investors over & over again, for prolonged periods, Craptomato Daddy King 🍅👑😊 all my predictions coming true....

This comes on the back of the aggressive selling from long-term holders (LTHs) we have been witnessing.  We see  wallets that typically hold BTC for 155 days or more, are offloading coins at one of the fastest paces since the October 2025 correction. This kind of supply release is important because it usually signals a shift in conviction: coins are moving from patient holders to more short-term, speculative hands, which tends to make the market more fragile and reactive to news. When this happens near key support zones, price often overshoots to the downside before a proper bottom forms.  Now I think there are three zones to look out for: 1. Around 82k: where BTC is currently trading and trying to build a short-term base. 2. The 80k zone: a major psychological and technical level that many traders see as “must hold” support for the current cycle structure 3. Below 80k: where a deeper flush could trigger more liquidations if confidence breaks and buyers step back.  If long-term holders keep dumping and macro risk-off continues, a clean break of 80k could mean a more down move as, stop losses & liquidations stack on each other. If BTC can stabilize above 80–82k & LTH selling slows, this dump could end up as a healthy reset, shaking out leverage and weak hands before the next leg up. ETF and spot demand would need to reappear to absorb the supply though.  The main question should be, will $BTC  hold 80–82k region?  #Bitcoin  #BTC  #CryptoMarkets","gravity_id":"373342278","id":111351,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T09:50:08.151Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T09:50:08.151Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T09:56:00.130Z","text_content":"$BTC  just hit its lowest point since March 2025 🔴  That’s right — we’re sitting at $82,555, a level we haven't seen in 10 months.

You don’t need complex models. RSI, MACD, and moving averages help spot trend, momentum, and overbought/oversold zones. Studies show RSI + MACD give 86%+ accuracy on BTC; LTC correlates 0.802 to major cryptos, making this framework effective.  RSI: Measures momentum 0–100. <30 → oversold, >70 → overbought, cross 50 → momentum shift. Jan 2026: 14-day RSI 35–47 (neutral/slightly oversold).  MACD: Tracks momentum using 12–26 EMA difference, 9 EMA signal, and histogram. Bullish crossover → rising momentum ($87–95 if $82 holds). Bearish crossover → selling pressure, stronger when RSI <50. Histogram expansion signals strengthening trend.  Moving Averages: 50-day & 200-day SMA define trend. Golden cross → bullish, death cross → bearish. Jan 2026: 50-day ~$79–80 (resistance), 200-day downward; support $67–70. Short-term 20-day SMA ~$76–80 offers dynamic levels.  Trade Strategy: Align ≥2 indicators, check volume, set 5–7% stop-loss. Example: RSI ~28 + bullish MACD + price near 200-day SMA = high-probability buy.  Bitget Features: Low fees, TradingView charts, LTC futures up to 125x, alerts, $703M fund, copy trading, bots, Earn, and TradFi for gold, forex, and indices using USDT.  Litecoin Outlook (Jan 2026): Price $67–75, RSI 35–47, MACD bearish daily/mixed 4H, Fear & Greed 23–24. Support $67–70, resistance $80–82/$100. Short-term: $77–78 likely if momentum builds; break $82 → $95–100. Medium-term: $100–150 if sentiment improves, ahead of July 2027 halving.

Crypto savings accounts are now a simple way many users earn from crypto without active trading. In 2026, instead of chasing short-term price moves, users deposit assets and earn interest through flexible savings, fixed terms, staking or structured earn products. The key difference between platforms is how yields, withdrawals and risks are handled.  📌What is a crypto savings account? A crypto savings account allows users to deposit digital assets and earn interest over time. Some products are flexible and allow withdrawals anytime, while fixed products lock assets for higher returns. Stablecoins usually offer more predictable yields than volatile tokens.  📌Which platforms are commonly used for crypto savings? Users typically compare platforms by yield range, asset support and flexibility: Bitget: Flexible and fixed savings, staking, structured earn, broad asset coverage Nexo: Simple savings with higher rates tied to loyalty tiers Coinbase: Conservative rewards focused on staking and USDC Binance: Wide range of earn products with variable yields Cryptocom: Fixed-term savings with loyalty-based rates Each platform balances risk and reward differently.  📌What should users consider before choosing? Interest rate alone isn’t enough. Withdrawal terms, transparency, supported assets and how yields are generated all matter. Flexible access suits cautious users, while fixed or structured products fit higher-return strategies.  Final thought Crypto savings in 2026 is about consistency, not hype. The best platform depends on risk tolerance, lock-up preference and asset exposure.  FAQs 1. Are crypto savings risk-free? No they carry platform and market risk. 2. Do I need to lock funds? Some products are flexible others are fixed. 3. Good for beginners? Yes especially flexible savings.

Instead of monthly spot buys, we plugged two SHA256 ASICs into WhiteBIT’s WhitePool: ~$6,000 in hardware and ~$650/month in power. Hashrate went to WhitePool, FPPS rewards hit their WhiteBIT account once a day.  \r 🤝After six months, the setup produced just over 0.1 BTC, paid daily under FPPS with a flat 2% fee and credited straight to the same WhiteBIT account they used for FX and settlements, ready to convert or lend in a single order - a predictable $BTC  drip instead of praying for lucky blocks.  \r 🔥Sick of hoping you picked the right candle?

Not after ICOs. Not after DeFi summer. Not after FTX.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThis wasn’t a press release. It was a procedural breakthrough, the kind that decides whether laws ever exist at all.\nSo what exactly moved?\n\nThe bill that passed is the Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act, handled by the Senate Agriculture Committee. It’s effectively the Senate’s counterpart to the CLARITY Act, which the House passed in 2025.\n\nSame destination. Different doors.\n\nThe Agriculture Committee’s role is commodities, which tells you immediately where this bill is headed.\nAt the center of the bill is a long-running question US regulators have avoided answering clearly:\n\nWho actually regulates crypto?\n\nThis bill draws a hard line.\n\nDigital commodities - including Bitcoin - fall under the CFTC.\n\nNot just futures. Spot markets too.\nThat’s a major shift from regulation-by-enforcement toward regulation-by-design.\nThe bill also does something Washington has struggled with for years: definitions.\n\nIt treats memecoins as digital commodities, not securities.\n\nIt explicitly excludes securities and stablecoins, pushing those into a different regulatory lane.\n\nThat separation isn’t accidental. It’s how lawmakers are trying to untangle years of SEC–CFTC turf wars.\nBut this bill alone doesn’t become law.\n\nTo reach the Senate floor, it must be merged with a separate bill from the Senate Banking Committee, which covers:\n\n• Security tokens\n• SEC oversight\n• Stablecoin rules\n\nThink of Agriculture and Banking as two halves of the same circuit. Neither works alone\nThat’s where the politics get complicated.\n\nThe Agriculture bill passed 12–11 on party lines. Every Republican voted yes. Every Democrat voted no.\n\nDemocrats didn’t object to defining crypto markets — they objected to what wasn’t included.\n\nSpecifically: ethics.\nDuring the markup, Democrats pushed amendments to:\n\n• Prevent public officials from profiting from crypto\n• Add stricter anti-fraud language\n• Block any future crypto bailouts\nAll of them failed.\n\nCommittee leadership argued those issues fall outside Agriculture’s jurisdiction, meaning they’re likely to resurface in the Banking Committee instead.\nThat tension matters because of the math.\n\nTo pass the full Senate, this bill needs at least seven Democratic votes. Without bipartisan changes especially around ethics, it doesn’t move.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate fight has been quietly intensifying: stablecoin yield.\n\nThe Senate Banking draft includes Section 404, which would ban crypto platforms from offering yield or interest on stablecoins they custody.\n\nThis closes a loophole left open by the GENIUS Act (2025), which regulated stablecoin issuance, but not third-party yields.\nThat single section has split the industry.\n\nBanks support the ban.\nCrypto firms — including Coinbase — oppose it.\n\nBecause yield products sit at the intersection of payments, deposits, and capital markets. Whoever controls that lane controls a lot more than stablecoins.\n\nThis is now one of the bill’s biggest pressure points.\nAll of this explains why January mattered.\n\nOn Jan 26, the White House hosted closed-door meetings with banks, crypto firms, and industry groups to break the stablecoin deadlock.\n\nOn Jan 29, regulators relaunched Project Crypto, a joint SEC–CFTC initiative focused on:\n\n• Asset taxonomy\n• Clear jurisdiction\n• Tokenized collateral and market innovation\nThese weren’t coincidences. They were coordination.\nZooming out, the pattern is clear.\n\n• GENIUS Act in 2025 → stablecoin foundations\n• CLARITY Act passes the House\n• Senate committees finally move\n• Regulators align publicly\n\nAfter years of enforcement-first chaos, Washington is building structure slowly, imperfectly, but deliberately.\nThe most important shift isn’t who wins SEC vs CFTC.\n\nIt’s that US crypto regulation has moved from:\n“Should we regulate this?”\nto\n“How do we divide responsibility before the next failure?”\n\nThat’s not hype. That’s how laws are born.\nThis bill still has hurdles. It still needs compromise. It still might stall.\n\nBut one thing is no longer true:\n\nCrypto market structure in the US is no longer theoretical.\n\nIt’s procedural now.\n\nFor more such insights, follow @CPOfficialtx","gravity_id":"373341906","id":111539,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T11:20:07.692Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T11:20:07.692Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T11:16:45.097Z","text_content":"🚨 @binance will convert its entire $1B SAFU fund from stablecoins into Bitcoin placing its big bet!\n\n• $1B SAFU reserves to be fully converted to BTC within 30 days\n• SAFU will be actively rebalanced\n• If fund value drops below $800M, Binance tops it back to $1B\n\nThis is important because -\n\n• SAFU was created in 2018 as Binance’s user protection backstop\n• This is the first time SAFU is moving away from stablecoins\n• Binance currently reports $162.8B in fully backed user assets across 45 tokens\n\nContext the market should note: Since 2022, stablecoins have faced depegs, bank exposure, and regulatory risk.

All signs point to Kevin Warsh, a former Fed Governor with a deep history on Wall Street. For #Bitcoin  holders, thiscould be a major shift in the \"rules of the game.\"\r \r Who is Kevin Warsh?\r Warsh is often described as a \"hawk,\" which in central bank terms means he prioritizes keeping inflation low and the dollar strong. He’s known for his \"tough love\" approach to the economy, often favoring higher interest rates and a smaller Fed balance sheet to prevent the economy from overheating.\r \r The Bitcoin Tug-of-War\r The reaction in the crypto market has been a mix of caution and curiosity. Here is why his potential appointment is creating a \"double-edged sword\" for Bitcoin:\r \r The Challenge (Tight Liquidity): Bitcoin usually thrives when #theFed  is \"printing money\", and interest rates are low. Because Warsh leans toward monetary discipline, some traders fear that a tighter Fed will suck the \"easy money\" out of the market, putting downward pressure on high-risk assets like $BTC .\r \r The Opportunity (Institutional Respect): Unlike some traditional bankers who dismiss Bitcoin as a \"scam,\" Warsh has recently spoken about it with a level of intellectual respect.

The current Fear & Greed Index has plunged to 15 (Extreme Fear), indicating peak negative sentiment among traders. This represents the most fearful market reading in over a month, with the index dropping from 62 (Greed) to 15 in just two weeks.  The correction appears driven by technical factors including record options expiries and institutional profit-taking rather than fundamental deterioration. Bitcoin's market structure remains intact with strong institutional interest and healthy valuation metrics despite the price pullback.  Historically, extreme fear readings below 20 have often preceded significant rebounds, making current levels a potential accumulation zone for long-term investors. However, technical confirmation of support around $80,000-$82,000 is advised before major position increases. This correction represents typical bull market volatility rather than structural damage, though near-term pressure may continue until sentiment stabilizes.   Bottom line: Bitcoin's 15% pullback to extreme fear territory offers potential entry opportunities for patient investors, though technical confirmation is recommended before aggressive buying. The fundamentals remain strong despite short-term sentiment headwinds.","gravity_id":"373344441","id":111721,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T12:40:05.504Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T12:50:08.155Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T12:37:45.036Z","text_content":"Miner Exodus Alert!\n\nA BTC miner \"exodus\" may push price below $60K, signaling significant profit pressure.\n\nExpect hashprice to trend down with falling BTC values.\n\nUse Lumerin to secure flexible hashpower and navigate market shifts.","gravity_id":"373344426","id":111722,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T12:40:05.692Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T12:40:05.692Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T12:36:10.347Z","text_content":"$BTC After every big dip, an upward movement follows! 🔥🌕","gravity_id":"373349772","id":111723,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T12:40:05.874Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T12:40:05.874Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T12:35:47.798Z","text_content":"I'm bearish on $BTC  When the war begins between the United States and Iran, that the Strait of Ormuz will see its first oil tankers begin to explode and the aircraft carriers of the USA be sunked by Iranian hypersonic missiles you will see the bitcoin make -50% minimum ..

I’ve personally seen even basic crypto wallets spark serious security concerns.  To assess the risks, I compared infrastructure options and calculated the likelihood of attacks using “hot” wallets - the numbers were eye-opening. Then I looked into WhiteBIT CaaS: cold storage, two-factor authentication, and multi-layered protection. My takeaway - you can delegate security to experts without losing client trust.  🚀 Integrating WhiteBIT CaaS into the platform delivered good results and such clear benefits: - Clients get secure crypto transactions - More than 330 cryptocurrencies over 80 networks  - The team can focus on product growth instead of cybersecurity headaches  💡 Takeaway for Investors & Businesses: The myth that crypto automatically increases risk is busted. With the right infrastructure, businesses can scale safely while protecting clients and preserving trust.  🔒 Ensure your crypto transactions are safe with WhiteBIT CaaS 👉https://institutional.whitebit.com/crypto-as-a-service?utm_source=coinmarketcap&utm_medium=caaspst&utm_campaign=post    #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373346941","id":111727,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T12:40:07.155Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T12:40:07.155Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T12:47:18.922Z","text_content":"$BTCCrypto Alpha Lab VIP Signals 🚀🚀\nPair: IR/USDT\n\nPosition Size: 2%-5%\nLONG  Leverage CROSS 20x\n\nEntry Zone: 6026 - 5804.5\n\nTargets: 6152.77 - 6201.65 - 6281.08 - 6415.5 - 6598.8 - 7026.5 - 7637.5 - 9165\n\nStop Loss: 5682.3","gravity_id":"373349865","id":111741,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T12:50:05.632Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T12:50:05.632Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T12:47:09.104Z","text_content":"$BTC  Right now, many people are asking why the crypto market is dumping so hard without any major bad news. The reality is simple: this move is driven by fear, massive liquidations, and heavy market manipulation. Bitcoin has a real chance of dropping to the 74K level or even lower, and the market sentiment has entered extreme fear. At the same time, the US stock market remains relatively strong, and there is no serious negative news to justify such a sharp fall. ETF selling pressure, large-scale long liquidations, and liquidity hunting by big players are pushing the market down intentionally. The fact that gold and silver also saw sharp declines shows this is part of a broader capital movement, not just crypto. In this environment, emotional trading is the biggest mistake—especially in futures, which is extremely risky right now.

While $1.7B in liquidations dominated headlines, the crash was actually triggered by on-chain structural failures.  1. The $84,600 Trap: BTC lost a massive on-chain support cluster at $84,600 (where 3.11% of supply was held). Once this \"floor\" broke, it triggered a cascade that liquidators only finished. 2. Long-Term Exit: While whales kept buying, long-term holders (LTHs) quietly dumped 144,000 BTC this month, their largest monthly outflow of this cycle. 3. Risk & Support: A daily close below $81,000 targets the $75,000 zone. Bulls must reclaim $84,600 to flip the bearish \"Head & Shoulders\" structure. 4.

Introduction   As crypto matures in 2026, investors are favoring yield-bearing assets that blend DeFi rewards with centralized exchange security. Libera Financial (LIBERA) fits this shift, offering automated rewards with broad exchange support.  Libera Financial’s Role?  LIBERA began as a decentralized auto-staking protocol and evolved into a compliant, yield-focused digital asset. Holders earn rewards automatically no locking, no complex DeFi steps. Regulatory clarity has allowed major exchanges to integrate these mechanics directly.  Where LIBERA Is Traded?  Bitget: Spot trading, earn products, automated compounding, and Web3 access Kraken: Secure, regulated spot trading Coinbase: Limited access via Web3 wallets OSL: Institutional custody and OTC services Binance: Global support, with U.S. restrictions Why Bitget Stands Out Bitget offers the deepest LIBERA integration allowing seamless movement between trading and yield products, plus Proof of Reserves and protection funds for added trust.  Conclusion LIBERA sits at the intersection of DeFi yield and centralized reliability. While several platforms support it, exchanges with strong yield integration, transparency, and compliance like Bitget offer the most complete experience.  FAQs  Is LIBERA on major exchanges? Yes Bitget, Kraken, Binance, and others. Best platform for LIBERA? Bitget, due to yield + trading integration. Does LIBERA earn automatically? Yes, on supported platforms. Can U.S. users trade it? Yes, via compliant exchanges. Is exchange custody safe? Generally yes in 2026, though self-custody is optional.  $BTC  Source: https://www.bitget.com/academy/libera-financial-trading-cryptocurrencies-major-exchanges-2026-america-investor-guide","gravity_id":"373350361","id":111899,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T14:00:09.046Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T14:00:09.046Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T13:52:45.072Z","text_content":"The digital asset treasury meta is evolving.\n\nDATs need BTC yield.

Watching the price and trading activity around these levels will show if $BTC can stay strong or if more losses are coming.","gravity_id":"373351088","id":111917,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T14:10:07.426Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T14:10:07.426Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T14:04:08.009Z","text_content":"🔸High-risk scenario for $BTC  as a critical divergence emerges: ⚠️   🔹 $BTC  Price: Significant drop, breaking through key support levels.    🔹  Derivatives: Substantial spike in estimated leverage ratio (ELR).

The breakdown slices through a previously reliable weekly support, shifting the structure into a visibly fragile state. Technically, $84K now stands as a vulnerable flip zone. Price is drifting below the weekly EMA ribbon, momentum is cooling, and the weekly RSI is gently rolling over from stretched levels  all signs of a tired trend. Selling volume has expanded with the move, reinforcing that this isn’t a hollow breakdown. Below current price, the $80K–$78K region remains a dense, high-interest demand pocket formed during prior consolidation. Above, $88K–$90K is the heavy resistance band that must be reclaimed to restore strength.

Momentum indicators point to neutral-to-weak short-term pressure, while volatility compression earlier this month has resolved to the downside. A reclaim of $90,000+ would be required to reset bullish structure, while sustained trading below $80,000 could open the door to a deeper retracement.

On COMEX in the US silver sits near ninety two while in Shanghai physical silver clears close to one hundred thirty. A premium of more than forty percent on the same metal is not inefficiency. It is structural distortion.  The core issue is how silver is priced in different markets. In the US COMEX is dominated by paper contracts. Most volume represents claims not metal. Estimates place the paper to physical ratio around three hundred fifty to one which means hundreds of paper ounces can exist for every real ounce. When large players dump contracts the paper price falls even if no physical silver changes hands. Supply on paper increases instantly while real availability stays tight. $BTC    Shanghai tells a different story. Prices there reflect actual physical transactions where delivery matters. Buyers are not trading leverage. They are sourcing metal. Premiums appear only when supply is constrained and contracts are no longer sufficient. Physical silver holding above one hundred twenty and trading near one hundred thirty shows that demand is immediate and inventory is stressed.  This is why the divergence persists. Where paper dominates prices can be suppressed. Where physical demand dominates prices rise to the level required to clear real supply. COMEX is showing a paper reference. Shanghai is showing the true clearing price.  When a market splits like this it signals that paper pricing no longer represents reality. The gap itself is the evidence. Physical silver is already repricing. The paper market is simply lagging behind. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373355846","id":112407,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T17:50:07.254Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T17:50:07.254Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-01-30T17:46:45.065Z","text_content":"Quick question for @CoinGecko: what's the definition of a Bitcoin DEX?\n\nYour rankings show ChangeNOW at #1 with 99.8% market share.
