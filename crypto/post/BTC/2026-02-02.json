The decline in $BTC  also led to increased volatility in derivatives markets, with liquidations accelerating as key support levels failed. This move highlights the downside risk faced by even the largest institutional holders during aggressive market corrections.  While Strategy remains structurally bullish on $BTC  long term, the current drawdown underscores how quickly market sentiment can shift.

Gold and silver both got hit hard after running to fresh highs. Gold futures dropped to about $4,745 and silver dumped to around $78.5, one of the sharpest one day resets in decades. Copper sold off too, but held up better and stayed near $6/lb on the pullback, which feels more like an unwind than a full “commodities are over” call.  My simple setup is simple,  Gold: I’m watching for a reclaim and hold back above the post-dump base (roughly the 4.8-4.9k area). If it can’t reclaim, I treat bounces as sell-the-rip candidates with tight risk.  Silver: after a move like that, I avoid “catching the knife.” I wait for a lower high + breakdown, or a clean base + breakout before touching it.  Copper: if it holds around $6 and starts putting in higher lows, I’m more open to continuation longs versus trying to fade it.  I’ve been trading these moves on Bitget TradFi since it’s easier to react when the momentum shows up in metals. Also worth noting, Bitget has a TradFi Gold Trading Competition (Phase 2) running, so if you’re already trading gold there, it’s an extra layer on top, not a reason by itself.

With $BGB  being connected to a growing ecosystem and real payment utility through its Morph partnership, the exposure from Kraken doesn’t just help price visibility — it helps show practical use and maturity.

To buy now or wait a little?   After such a strong move up, it’s normal to see price cool off as short-term traders take profit and momentum resets. At the same time, broader market uncertainty is still in the background, which is why gold continues to stay relevant compared to more volatile assets like $BTC    Instead of trying to trade every bounce or panic dip, I focus on how price reacts around key zones after a big move. If gold shows strength and structure again, that’s where higher-probability setups usually form. If not, patience matters more than forcing entries.  That’s why I’ve been trading these gold moves on Bitget TradFi. It makes it easier to follow momentum when it returns, rather than guessing during choppy phases. Plus, with the Bitget TradFi Gold Trading Competition (Phase 2) live, trading gold there comes with an added opportunity on top of regular setups.  Right now it’s less about hype and more about reacting to what price does next — and gold is at one of those decision points again. https://www.bitget.com/launchhub/trading-club/232979  $ZORA","gravity_id":"373420397","id":117395,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T22:00:08.099Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T22:00:08.099Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-01T21:53:46.155Z","text_content":"$BTC who said ETFs are good 🤭 her we are getting drained by those MFkrs left and Right.","gravity_id":"373422155","id":117396,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T22:00:08.307Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T22:00:08.307Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-01T21:53:19.262Z","text_content":"The market teaches the same lessons every cycle.

As one of the most established and compliance-focused exchanges globally, Kraken’s support significantly boosts BGB’s visibility, credibility, and access to new markets particularly in the U.S. and Europe, where regulated platforms are highly valued. Listings of this scale often act as strong sentiment catalysts, signaling maturity, resilience, and long-term relevance.  Earlier in the cycle, $BGB   traded near yearly lows around the 3.2–3.4 range, a period many investors overlooked during broader market consolidation. Since then, the token has undergone a clear re-rating, driven by consistent token burns, deflationary tokenomics, and expanding real-world utility. Bitget has steadily integrated BGB across staking, Launchpool access, governance participation, and wallet gas usage, while ongoing ecosystem growth has fueled genuine demand rather than speculation alone.  The Kraken listing represents a strategic expansion phase for BGB. Increased liquidity, broader institutional and retail exposure, and improved market confidence tend to support sustained demand over time. Combined with controlled supply mechanics and growing on-chain and exchange utility, this development positions BGB favorably as capital and attention continue flowing into the ecosystem.

For example, if you spot a bearish engulfing candle on the 5-minute chart after price taps 77,761, that’s a strong entry signal. Take profits can be taken at 76,761, then 75,719. - Stop-loss should be kept above the swing high of the rejection candle or above the next resistance. - If the price breaks and holds above 79,220 with strong buying momentum (high volume, bullish structure on lower timeframes), then expect a move toward 81,871 or even 84,621, which would flip the bias neutral/bullish for a short-term rally. - For aggressive traders, a long scalp is possible only if there’s a fast sweep below 75,719 with a quick reclaim and strong reversal signals, but this is higher risk.  📊 Get detailed free analysis of any coin on any timeframe you want.

I’ll be honest: when $BTC  slipped below $78K and the market cap dropped toward ~$2.6T, the question stopped being “why is this happening?” and became “how do you survive this phase?”  From what I’m seeing, this isn’t a narrative crash - it’s mechanics. Over $2.5B in liquidations in 24 hours, weekend liquidity drying up, and leverage getting flushed. When demand is thin and forced sellers hit the market, price falls fast. That’s how we end up talking about $75K support again.  So what’s my bear market strategy right now?  • Reduce leverage first. Survival > catching bottoms • Focus on key levels, not predictions ($75K matters more than headlines) • Stay liquid. Cash is a position in bear phases • Wait for liquidations to slow before thinking about aggressive entries  Altcoins will always bleed more in these moments - that’s normal. Extreme fear (Fear & Greed at 18) doesn’t mean buy blindly; it means be patient. Bear markets aren’t about being brave - they’re about staying solvent long enough to act when structure improves.  For me, the play is simple: protect capital now, watch how $BTC  behaves around $75K-$77K, and only get constructive once selling pressure actually exhausts. Everything else is noise.  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373423281","id":117456,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T22:40:08.065Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T22:40:08.065Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-01T22:48:55.562Z","text_content":"Markets Lose Their Balance as Risk Appetite Fades Across Assets The crypto economy now stands at roughly $2.6 trillion, but the headline number hides a sharp deterioration beneath the surface.

Here’s the part many are missing. Yes, Strategy is technically underwater on paper - but there’s no forced selling risk. Its 712,647 BTC are unencumbered, never used as collateral. Even the $8.2B in convertible debt doesn’t bite until 2027, leaving room to refinance, extend, or convert.  The real pressure point isn’t solvency - it’s demand. On-chain data shows fading capital inflows, and CryptoQuant notes a flat Realized Cap, which historically rules out a bull phase. That’s what’s weighing on price, not balance sheet stress.  Michael Saylor has been here before. In 2022, Strategy kept buying while shares traded below $BTC  value - and he’s repeatedly said deep drawdowns aren’t liquidation events, they’re accumulation windows.

They are confusing \"Cheap\" with \"Value.\" Here is the data that matters more than your feelings:   ❌ THE RETAIL TRAP: \"RSI is 17.8 + Stochastic is 4.5. It has to bounce!\" (This is how you catch a falling knife).  ✅ THE SMART MONEY REALITY: Look at the ADX (Trend Strength). It is screaming at 48.3.   - Rule 1: When ADX is >40 and Price is dropping, \"Oversold\" doesn't mean reversal. It means Capitulation is just starting. - The Structure: We didn't just dip; we confirmed a Weekly CHoCH Bearish by losing $80,600. The floor is gone.  📉 THE BLUEPRINT: I am not guessing the bottom. I am trading the structure.  - THE \"NO TOUCH\" ZONE: Current Price (~$75k). Buying here is providing exit liquidity for whales. - THE \"REAL\" BUY ZONE: $74,457. This is the Bullish Order Block. Institutions need to sweep the stops below the recent lows to fill their bags. No sweep = No entry. - THE SHORT SETUP: Any bounce to $85k - $90k is a gift. That is the new Supply Zone (Broken Trendline Retest).  🧠 MY VERDICT: In a trend this strong, Cash is a Position. Don't be a hero. Let the market prove it found a floor at $74k before you risk a cent.  Are you buying the RSI or respecting the Trend? 👇   #Bitcoin  #Crypto  #SmartMoney  #BearMarket  #TradingPsychology  $BTC","gravity_id":"373420916","id":117514,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T23:30:08.503Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T23:30:08.503Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-01T23:23:58.182Z","text_content":"$BTC  76,020 Stop Loss for Longs.. 😉Old Readers charge","gravity_id":"373420900","id":117515,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T23:30:08.871Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T23:30:08.871Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-01T23:23:51.408Z","text_content":"$BTC\nMichael Saylor posted the Saylor Bitcoin tracker again, hinting at buying more BTC.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373423561","id":117516,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T23:30:09.239Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T23:30:09.239Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-01T23:22:45.106Z","text_content":"A seismic shift in Bitcoin's blockchain occurred today as tracking service Whale Alert reported a colossal transfer of 2,697 BTC, valued at approximately $208 million, from an unknown wallet to the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange.\nhttps://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-transfer-gemini/ ","gravity_id":"373423556","id":117517,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T23:30:09.605Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T23:30:09.605Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-01T23:39:10.231Z","text_content":"$BTC  These shorts here are cowards.

With $BTC  still navigating a fragile global market, the message from policymakers was clear: oversight comes first.  Under the new Finance Bill, failing to report crypto transactions will now cost ₹200 per day, while incorrect or misleading filings can trigger a ₹50,000 fine starting April 1, 2026. The goal, according to officials, is deterrence - not growth.  For the industry, that’s the frustration. Regulation is tightening, but incentives aren’t improving.

The move added to an 11.44% monthly decline, leaving the asset roughly 38% below its all-time high of $126,100, reached on Oct. 5.  #Bitcoin  analyst PlanC posted on X on Saturday that the dip could mark the bottom of this bull cycle. He compared the current #sell-off  to three prior episodes where $BTC  found a floor and reversed: the 2018 bear market #bottom  near $3,000, the March 2020 crash to around $5,100, and the post-FTX decline to roughly $15,500. \"Decent chance this will be the deepest pullback opportunity this Bitcoin bull run,\" PlanC wrote.  PlanC placed the likely range for the cycle bottom between $75,000 and $80,000. If that reading holds, Saturday's low lands squarely within that window, framing it as a potential accumulation point for traders willing to buy into weakness.  Financial accountant and $BTC  advocate Rajat Soni pushed back against that reading on X, urging traders to avoid reacting to weekend price action. \"Never trust a weekend pump OR dump,\" Soni wrote, adding that $BTC  tends to stage recoveries when sentiment is at its most bearish. His warning came as the market was processing over $2 billion in #liquidations .  Veteran trader Peter Brandt has taken a more cautious stance, predicting that $BTC  could fall to as low as $60,000 by Q3 2026. Analyst Benjamin Cowen expects the true cycle #low  to arrive in early October but noted he \"anticipates plenty of rallies will occur between now and then.\"  Jurrien Timmer, Fidelity's director of global macroeconomic research, described 2026 as a possible \"year off\" for $BTC , with prices potentially dropping to $65,000 before any sustained recovery takes shape.

Yet even with $BTC  trading below recent averages, Michael Saylor’s Strategy is signaling it’s ready to keep buying - sticking to its long-held accumulation playbook.  There are two ways to read this move:  • Bullish take: Strategy sees these dips as opportunity, doubling down on the belief that Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals outweigh short-term macro pressure.  • Risk view: Buying into weakness when liquidity is thin - and near or above your own cost basis - prioritizes conviction over near-term shareholder protection.  🤔 The signal is clear: Saylor isn’t blinking.

Elliott posted a chart on X tracking cumulative performance, which showed returns dipping below zero as of late January after $BTC  slid into the mid-$70,000 range.  The negative figure does not mean every #IBIT  holder is underwater. Investors who bought in early at lower prices likely still hold a gain. The problem is that the fund attracted enormous inflows at much higher price levels later in the year, and those purchases have pulled the overall dollar-weighted average into the red. On a per-dollar-invested basis, cumulative gains since the fund's launch have now been erased, Elliott's data showed.   IBIT's dollar-weighted returns peaked at roughly $35 billion in October, when $BTC  was trading near record highs. The fund remains one of BlackRock's most successful launches, having become the fastest #ETF  in history to reach $70 billion in assets under management. In October, it generated approximately $25 million more in fees than #BlackRock 's second-most profitable ETF, according to reports at the time.   Yahoo Finance data confirms that IBIT's net asset value has been declining for several weeks, tracking closely with the broader $BTC  sell-off. That erosion in underlying value is what has pushed aggregate investor returns into negative territory.   Outflows from $BTC  investment products have been accelerating alongside the price decline. In the week ending Jan. 25, $BTC  funds alone lost nearly $1.1 billion, while total crypto fund outflows reached $1.73 billion, the largest weekly #withdrawal  since mid-November, according to CoinShares. The majority of that capital left U.S.-based products.","gravity_id":"373427198","id":117676,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T01:20:06.635Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T01:30:09.210Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T01:14:56.269Z","text_content":"$BTC  The US is going to WIPED THEM OUT first thing in the morning, futures going up now.

Wallets holding 10,000 $BTC  or more are the only cohort currently in #accumulation , maintaining a neutral-to-slightly-positive balance trend since late November. Every other holder category is net selling.   Retail participants holding fewer than 10 $BTC  have been in persistent distribution for over a month. This group reflects continued risk aversion among smaller investors as $BTC  trades near $78,000, down sharply from its October all-time high of $126,000.   The number of unique entities holding at least 1,000 $BTC  has risen from 1,207 in October to 1,303 currently. This increase occurred entirely during the price #correction , indicating that larger players have been buying into weakness rather than reducing exposure.   Glassnode's Accumulation Trend Score measures relative behavior by wallet size, factoring in both balance and the amount of $BTC  acquired over the past 15 days. Scores near 1 indicate buying activity, while values closer to 0 signal selling. The largest whale cohort has remained near the buying end of this scale throughout the current drawdown.   Since $BTC  fell to $80,000 in late November, the price has largely traded within an $80,000 to $97,000 range through the end of January. During this consolidation window, #mega-whales  sustained a light accumulation phase while smaller holders continued to exit. Wallets holding at least 1,000 $BTC  are now back at December 2024 highs in terms of entity count.   The data paints a picture of supply absorption at the top end of the market. Large #Bitcoin  holders are absorbing coins that retail traders are offloading, a pattern that has historically appeared during the middle stages of #bull  market corrections before prices recover.","gravity_id":"373427259","id":117687,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T01:30:06.502Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T01:40:08.276Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T01:25:10.708Z","text_content":"📊 Bitcoin ( $BTC  ) Monthly Returns: What the Data Really Says   This heatmap highlights a recurring truth about Bitcoin: returns are highly seasonal, but not random.  Historically, Q1 and Q4 have delivered the strongest upside, while mid-year months tend to be more mixed or corrective.  Key observations:  • February, March, April, October, and November stand out with the highest average returns. November in particular is exceptional, posting one of the highest average and median monthly performances across Bitcoin’s history.  • June, August, and September are structurally weaker. June often marks trend exhaustion, while August–September frequently act as consolidation or drawdown periods before Q4 volatility returns.  • Large green months often follow clusters of red months. Bitcoin rarely trends smoothly — compression phases usually precede expansion.  • Volatility cuts both ways. Strong positive months don’t guarantee continuation, but historically they tend to appear after periods of pessimism rather than euphoria.  What this means for positioning:  This data doesn’t predict price direction, but it frames expectations. When the market enters historically strong months with depressed sentiment, risk-reward improves. Conversely, chasing strength during statistically weaker periods often leads to frustration.  Bitcoin isn’t random — it’s cyclical. Those who understand the rhythm focus less on short-term noise and more on where they are in the calendar, the cycle, and sentiment curve.  Seasonality doesn’t replace analysis — but ignoring it is leaving information on the table.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373427248","id":117688,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T01:30:06.900Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T01:40:08.652Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T01:22:50.903Z","text_content":"Whale Alert: #Hyperliquid  Whale (0xc38a) Short BTC with 20x leverage, entry price $76820.4, position value $11.43M.

I won't say what it is, because my future trading concept is something I haven't encountered anywhere else. The charts below show LTC and BTC for one year, with the BUY and SELL indicators visible. These are the very circumstances I discovered over the weekend; let's call it a concept. In some cases, this concept perfectly predicts growth, in others, it doesn't, but it still ends up in the black. The gist of the concept is that it only works in spot and futures without leverage for the SELL indicator! If the indicator BUYs, we buy; if the concept says SELLs, we sell, and we'll still make a profit. But if a BUY is followed by another BUY, we buy for the same amount as the first time and average it out, similar to the SELL. Now about profit. For example, if we were trading this system at the beginning of 2025 and invested $1,000 each in Bitcoin and Litecoin and split that amount 50/50 (risk management: we spent $200 per trade, and if the next indicator shows a negative result, we'd buy back the same amount), we'd earn 42% per annum on both Bitcoin and Litecoin WITHOUT DIVERSIFICATION, and even more with it. So, out of $2,000, our net profit would be $840. I'm currently working on this concept. What do I want to do with it? I want to write a Python script that will initially only track Bitcoin's structure and generate signals automatically, without my intervention. Then, I'll add other coins, but not low-value ones, only key ones. I estimate it will take me about two months to develop and test it. So subscribe to my Telegram channel and follow me in my bio to stay up to date with this indicator and earn money! I'll go into more detail in my Telegram account. Incidentally, this concept (I don't know what to call it) predicted the decline of gold and Dash, and now it's calling for buying Bitcoin. :)","gravity_id":"373429720","id":117987,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T05:20:07.994Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T05:20:07.994Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T05:16:23.491Z","text_content":"$BTC  👉 \"Alright guys, a new week has started – new vibes, new walk, new talk, new moves – everything is awesome 😍 Get ready for the week ahead\"  🔥❤️🔥🥂","gravity_id":"373430056","id":117988,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T05:20:08.378Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T05:20:08.378Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T05:16:21.479Z","text_content":"$BTC  I'm bullish on BTC$BTC  blackrock and goverment Bank central buy and Hold Bitcoin Strategy","gravity_id":"373429719","id":117989,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T05:20:08.750Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T05:20:08.750Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T05:15:25.397Z","text_content":"Believe it or not, this is how it’s likely to play out.\r \r $BTC  is sitting on a major HTF demand zone aligned with the 0.5 Fibonacci level.\r This base is being built for the next expansion leg.\r Higher prices are coming, save this post. 📈\r \r #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"373430049","id":117990,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T05:20:09.121Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T05:20:09.121Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T05:28:49.460Z","text_content":"📊 JUST IN : #Bitcoin  hits $75,000    #crypto   BTC  $BTC","gravity_id":"373430128","id":117997,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T05:30:06.367Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T05:30:06.367Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T05:27:02.949Z","text_content":"I'm bearish on $BTC  Microstrategy will liquidate its bitcoins, Michael Saylor will have to explain himself to his board of directors.

The sell-off into the 74,500–75,000 zone was impulsive and backed by heavy volume, confirming that sellers are still in control on the higher timeframe. The current move back toward 75.5k–76k is a technical relief bounce, not a confirmed reversal. Buyers are reacting to oversold conditions, but momentum on the upside is still weak and cautious.\n‎\n‎As long as  $BTC trades below 78,000–78,800, the broader structure stays bearish. Any upside attempts into this zone are likely to face selling pressure again. For longs taken near 74.5k, this bounce is an opportunity to protect profits and trail stops aggressively, not to add blindly. Fresh longs here carry poor risk unless price reclaims and holds above key resistance with strong volume.\n‎\n‎On the downside, losing 75,000 again would signal continuation weakness and opens the door toward 73,500 and potentially the low-72k area next. This keeps the market in a high-risk, high-volatility phase where patience matters more than prediction.\n‎\n‎What to do now:\n‎If you’re long from lower levels, secure profits and tighten stops. If you’re short, avoid adding near support and wait for clean rejection at resistance. If you’re flat, staying sidelined until confirmation is the smartest play. Right now, Bitcoin is still in a bearish environment, and capital protection should be the top priority.\n‎","gravity_id":"373431233","id":118111,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T06:40:09.420Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T06:40:09.420Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T06:49:39.392Z","text_content":"$BTC 67$$$$$$\nLong","gravity_id":"373430678","id":118119,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T06:50:07.029Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T06:50:07.029Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T06:49:04.723Z","text_content":"$BTC♨️ #H/USDT ♨️ \n\n🟢 LONG  :-- 10X - 20X\n\n🧭 ENTRY  :--  $0.102 - $0.100\n\n🧿 TARGET  :-- $0.105\n                           $0.110\n                           $0.115\n                          \n⛔ STOPLOSS  :---  $0.098","gravity_id":"373430676","id":118120,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T06:50:07.436Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T06:50:07.436Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T06:46:52.902Z","text_content":"$BTC good bye Michael Saylor hahahaha","gravity_id":"373431333","id":118121,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T06:50:07.808Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T06:50:07.808Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T06:45:56.019Z","text_content":"Strategy’s massive Bitcoin position is showing a sizeable drawdown as $BTC  trades around the $75,000 mark, well below recent highs. As a result, the firm is now sitting on an estimated $900 million in unrealized losses on its BTC holdings.  This loss reflects the sharp pullback from earlier peaks, where Bitcoin rallied well above current prices. Even for a long-term holder like Strategy, significant drawdowns can surface when markets enter correction phases, especially if accumulation occurred near higher price levels.  The unrealized loss underscores the downside risk inherent in concentrated positions, especially in volatile assets like Bitcoin. While these losses are “on paper” and not realized unless positions are sold, they do impact balance sheet valuations and can influence risk management decisions.  With Bitcoin still struggling to breach resistance near $80K and broader market sentiment mixed, Strategy’s position highlights how even institutional holders are not immune to short-term volatility even when maintaining a long-term bullish thesis on Bitcoin’s role as digital store of value. #BTC Price Analysis#  #BTC  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373430663","id":118122,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T06:50:08.189Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T06:50:08.189Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T06:45:03.822Z","text_content":"$BTC I AM BOULLISH ON THE BITCOIN!

This part of the cycle feels uncomfortable - and that’s usually the point.

The charts hint that downside pressure is getting stretched. RSI on higher time frames is approaching levels seen near past market bottoms, while the daily RSI is already deeply oversold. That doesn’t guarantee a bounce - but it does suggest much of the damage may already be done.  Here’s what I’m watching next. A sustained reclaim of $80K would be the first sign of stabilization. A stronger signal comes above ~$84.5K, which could flip the structure toward recovery.

Bitcoin alone accounted for over $200 million of those long liquidations.\r \r Liquidation occurs when an exchange or broker is forced to close a trader’s position because the market moves against them and they no longer have enough margin to cover the risk. A majority of the wipeout from long positions occurs when an asset’s price faces a sudden, unexpected drop.   Exchanges are forced to close these bets, which in turn triggers a liquidity cascade that could continue to hurt prices.\r \r This cascade of liquidations initially took hold over the weekend when more than $2.4 billion in bullish positions were wiped out, creating a climate of fear that continues to drive traders away from the market. #BTC Correction Incoming?#  $BTC  The sell-off was further exacerbated by a precious metals meltdown. A crash in gold and silver prices forced many traders to liquidate their Bitcoin holdings to cover losses on their precious metals positions.\r \r Trader appetite for risky assets also took a hit from President Donald Trump’s recent nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair. Investors fear that he will aggressively shrink the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and tighten liquidity, effectively removing the easy money environment that tends to support speculative assets like Bitcoin.\r \r Meanwhile, unlike previous dips, Bitcoin’s sharp sell-off this time was shaped by a noticeable absence of buyers. Institutional interest in the legacy crypto asset has cooled significantly, with spot Bitcoin ETFs recording over 1.6 billion in net outflows throughout January.","gravity_id":"373434597","id":118333,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T10:40:08.542Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T10:40:08.542Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T10:35:16.796Z","text_content":"$BTC bounce time.","gravity_id":"373435272","id":118334,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T10:40:08.763Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T10:40:08.763Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T10:33:35.983Z","text_content":"gm\r $BTC  at 77.6k after the drop to 74k.\r still holding above 74.3k, but stuck below 80.4k.  \r \r scenarios:\r – break 80.4k → 97–109k\r – reject → range between 74–80k\r – lose 74k → 64k comes fast  \r \r macro still messy.

While the process seems straightforward, the final amount received can vary widely depending on the conversion method used.  Why the Peruvian Sol Is Important? The Peruvian Sol is one of Latin America’s more stable currencies, supported by disciplined monetary policy and strong commodity exports such as copper and gold. This stability makes PEN reliable for local transactions, while USD remains essential for international trade, savings, and cross-border payments.  How Much Does the PEN/USD Rate Vary by Transaction Type?  Exchange rates differ across cash, bank transfers, cards, and digital platforms. Cash exchanges often include wide spreads and hidden fees. Bank transfers usually offer better pricing but may involve processing delays. Card transactions tend to use competitive network rates, though foreign transaction fees can reduce the final value.  How Can Crypto Exchanges Help With PEN/USD Conversion?  Crypto exchanges provide an alternative route for converting PEN to USD value. Platforms like Bitget and Binance allow users to access market-driven pricing and convert funds into USD-pegged stablecoins or assets such as Bitcoin $BTC  . BTC’s global liquidity and 24/7 trading can help reduce spreads and speed up settlement for crypto-native users.  Conclusion Choosing the right conversion method matters. While banks and cash services remain common, crypto platforms and Bitcoin-based tools are increasingly offering faster, more transparent alternatives for converting PEN to USD.

In 2026, platforms compete on fees, multi-chain access, and trading tools for both beginners and pro traders.

The best platform depends on user goals, preferred assets, fee structure, and trading experience level.  FAQs Are NFT marketplaces safe?

The key distinction is mindset: savings prioritizes capital preservation first, yield second especially for assets like #BTC that are often held with a long term view.\n\n\nKey things to understand\n\t•\tMarket phase matters: sideways or corrective periods tend to increase interest in savings products.\n\t•\tRisk varies by structure: returns are tied to lockups, counterparty risk, or product design.\n\t•\tBTC behavior: many holders prefer conservative strategies rather than aggressive yield chasing.\n\n\nFAQ\n\t•\tIs crypto passive income guaranteed?\nNo. Returns depend on market conditions and the specific product used.\n\n\n\t•\tWhy do BTC holders consider savings options?\nBecause BTC is often treated as long term capital, not an asset to trade daily.\n\n\n\t•\tWhen does it make sense?\nWhen holding through volatility and prioritizing discipline over short term moves.\n\n\nConclusion\nCrypto passive income works best when it supports patience, not speculation. In periods like this, the real edge isn’t doing more it’s managing capital thoughtfully while waiting for clearer market direction. Platforms like Bitget offer access to these options, but the decision always starts with understanding risk and time horizon.\n\n\nhttps://www.bitget.com/academy/top-crypto-savings-accounts-for-earning-interest-with-high-apy\n\n\n#Bitcoin #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373436097","id":118584,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T12:30:09.446Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T12:30:09.446Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T12:22:25.463Z","text_content":"$74K Bitcoin: Crisis or Opportunity? 📉👀 ​$BTC  just hit its lowest level since 2024, touching $74,000. The timeline is flooded with panic, fear, and doubts. But if you’ve been in this space long enough, you know that emotion is the enemy of profit. ​While the crowd is panic selling, the smart money is asking a different question: \"How do I position myself for the next cycle?\" ​My Take on the Best Bear Market Strategy: ​🔻 1. Survive First, Profit Second: Capital preservation is key right now. This isn't the time for 100x leverage or chasing obscure memecoins. The goal is to still be in the game when the market turns. Cut the leverage. ​🔻 2. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is King: Trying to catch the exact bottom is a fool's errand. Instead of going \"all in\" at once, spread your buys. Whether it’s weekly or monthly, consistent accumulation beats emotional timing every time. ​🔻 3. Flight to Quality: In downturns, liquidity dries up in altcoins first. Stick to high-conviction assets (like BTC and ETH) that have stood the test of time. History shows that downturns are exactly when strong long-term positions are built. ​The Reality Check: Markets move in cycles. The fear you see today is the fuel for the next bull run. If you liked Bitcoin at $90k, you should love it at $74k—if your thesis hasn't changed. ​What’s your move? Are you catching the falling knife, or sitting on hands until we see a reversal? 👇 ​#Bitcoin  #CryptoMarket  #DCA  #HODL  #BTC74k","gravity_id":"373438621","id":118585,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T12:30:09.825Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T12:30:09.825Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T12:39:48.035Z","text_content":"Crypto market is under heavy pressure $BTC  has slipped to the $75k - $77k range, with over $2B in liquidation, raising fear, whale selling and macro-driven risk-off sentiment.  ﻿I have traded through many circles, and finding reliable real-time insights used to be a struggle.

But what’s actually happening is more nuanced. Liquidity expectations shifted. Rates staying higher, dollar strength, forced unwinds, and cooling inflation narratives all compressed risk appetite at the same time. That pressure doesn’t just hit one asset class. It ripples across everything.  While $BTC  on the crypto side and $XAUt  on the metals side were both under pressure, what mattered was realizing that risk-off doesn’t mean uniform selling. Capital doesn’t disappear. It rotates.  Instead of forcing trades where price was weak, I spent time scanning across sectors. Most charts were red, but two stood out clearly. ORCL was up around 3% and APP close to 4%, holding green while broader markets struggled. That relative strength wasn’t random. It was capital looking for stability, cash flow visibility, and selective growth exposure.  Those ORCL and APP moves didn’t just keep me green. They directly helped me climb and stay relevant in the Stock Futures Championship.  One underrated benefit of taking part as a team is how much it expands your perspective. You’re constantly exposed to different ways of thinking. Someone focuses on macro, someone tracks sector rotation, someone spots relative strength early. That environment pushes you to explore markets you might normally overlook and refine how you react when conditions change.  In choppy markets, that shared learning matters more than chasing big moves.

I expect that if price sweeps below 78,231 USDT and shows a powerful bounce/rejection, we could see a relief rally back toward 86,074 USDT and possibly 90,600 USDT.\r - To enter a trade, watch for a manipulation move below the 78,231–74,604 USDT zone with a quick recovery above that support, confirmed by a pin bar, bullish engulfing, or a market structure shift on the 4H/1H. Enter after confirmation, target 86,074 USDT for partials, and 90,600 USDT for extended targets.\r - If price breaks through 74,604 USDT decisively and closes below it, I would wait for a new base to form at lower levels or look for short opportunities with 70,500 USDT and 69,000 USDT as the next support targets.\r - My bias would shift bullish only if price reclaims 86,074 USDT with strong momentum and holds above it—otherwise, I remain cautious and reactive at these key levels.\r \r 📝 T...\r \r 📊 Get detailed free analysis of any coin on any timeframe you want.

Rising interest rates and a stronger U.S. dollar are two of the biggest triggers when yields go up, holding non-yielding assets like gold and silver becomes less attractive, leading to sell-offs. Central bank policy signals, especially from the U.S. Federal Reserve, can quickly flip market sentiment. In addition, sudden improvements in risk appetite (when investors move back into stocks or crypto) and large institutional profit-taking after extended rallies can cause sharp pullbacks in both metals.  $BTC    The benefits of trading the uptrend actively   Actively trading gold and silver during an uptrend allows traders to ride momentum instead of predicting tops or bottoms. When metals are trending, price tends to respect higher highs and higher lows, creating repeated opportunities for entries on pullbacks and breakouts. Active uptrend trading also helps manage risk better traders can trail stops, lock in profits, and re-enter as momentum continues. On highly liquid platforms, volatility becomes an advantage, giving frequent chances to compound gains rather than waiting for long-term appreciation.   How crypto traders use Bitget TradFi to build their portfolio   Many crypto traders diversify into Bitget TradFi to capitalize on gold and silver trends without leaving a familiar trading environment. Since crypto traders are already skilled at momentum trading, leverage management, and 24/7 markets, they apply the same strategies to metals—especially during strong macro-driven trends. By trading gold and silver alongside crypto, traders reduce overexposure to one asset class while still staying active in trending markets. This diversification helps smooth portfolio performance, capture gains during metal uptrends, and build a more resilient portfolio across crypto and traditional assets.","gravity_id":"373440398","id":118956,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T14:40:07.344Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T14:40:07.344Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T14:33:24.289Z","text_content":"$BTC💥 #RIVER Long ALERT 💥\n🌐 Entry: 23.400\n 💬 Leverage 50X\n🎯 Targets:📥\n\nTP1: 24.200🔔\n\nTP2: 24.900💵\n\nTP3: 26.200📈\n\nTP4: 28.700🔤\n\n\n⛔️ Loss: 22.500\n\n🔗 Stay ready traders — this move can fly high! 🌎🛡","gravity_id":"373440394","id":118957,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T14:40:07.780Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T14:40:07.780Z"},{"crypto_id":"1","crypto_name":"BTC","post_time":"2026-02-02T14:33:00.066Z","text_content":"The lines are dynamic, so it'd be nice to wick down quick to 72-68K on some super news and then bounce!

Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, alongside venture capitalist Tim Draper, just launched a $40M political effort in California after a proposed wealth tax spooked Silicon Valley. All this is happening while $BTC  keeps the broader market uneasy.  The trigger? A ballot proposal calling for a one-time 5% tax on net worth over $1B, including unrealized gains. Larsen says it “woke a sleeping giant” and plans to personally commit up to $30M.
