DOGE is trading in a bearish pattern but is approaching significant demand zones around 0.13021, where a bullish reversal could occur. Should the price break above the resistance level of 0.15159, it could pave the way for targets at 0.17488 and 0.20953. Conversely, a failure to maintain above 0.13021 may lead to a retest of 0.12010, intensifying bearish momentum.

The filing is now in its final administrative stage, bringing the proposed TDOG ETF on Nasdaq closer to launch.  DOGE is pressing against the upper trendline of a Falling Wedge, a classic bullish reversal pattern. A breakout above $0.16 could open the path toward $0.18 and potentially $0.20.

Key Zones to Watch: ▶️ Bullish Order Block: $0.132 – $0.09 This is the best accumulation zone. If DOGE holds this range, we can expect a strong upward move.  ▶️ Very Strong Demand Zone: $0.08 – $0.05 Historically, prices in this zone attract massive buying pressure.
