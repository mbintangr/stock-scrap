This demand area has historically triggered strong relief phases, and current market structure hints at early accumulation.   A break and close above the $0.18–$0.20 resistance range would confirm strength, potentially opening the path toward $0.24–$0.26. Failure to reclaim mid-range may extend sideways compression, but downside appears limited unless $0.14 gives way.   The chart shows declining sell momentum and equal highs resting above, suggesting future liquidity taps.
