This marks the most aggressive liquidity expansion since Altseason 2021 — a backdrop that historically favors risk assets and crypto as capital flows back into higher-beta opportunities.  At the same time, BingX has quietly rolled out one of the more efficient reward structures this cycle. Stackable bonuses, clear progress tracking, and requirements aligned with normal trading behavior. Deposit milestones unlock $DOGE  rewards, spot trading targets unlock bonus vouchers (up to $95), and participation scales without forcing all-in exposure. It’s a tiered setup — move at your own pace, claim what you earn, and stop when it makes sense.
