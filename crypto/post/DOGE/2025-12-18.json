Price is down -5% in 24h to $0.125, extending a -15% weekly drawdown and breaking below its key macro trendline active since Feb 2024. This invalidates the prior bull structure and shifts momentum decisively risk-off.  From a technical standpoint, downside risk remains elevated. MACD and signal lines have moved below zero, with expanding bearish histograms - a classic continuation signal. Structurally, DOGE now faces a potential ~20% downside toward the $0.10 2024 demand zone before any relief bounce becomes statistically probable.  This weakness is not isolated. The broader memecoin sector is under pressure: total memecoin market cap is down -8% in 24h to $41.4B. High-beta leaders including PEPE, SHIB, BONK, and PENGU are each down 15%+ over 7 days, confirming sector-wide deleveraging rather than single-asset rotation.  What’s next? Near-term, memecoins remain sentiment-driven and vulnerable in a low-liquidity, low-conviction environment. Mid-to-long term, recovery hinges on US regulatory clarity, ETF-driven capital flows, and renewed risk appetite.
