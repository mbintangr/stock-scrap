I'm not going to go into this more than once, since it's absolutely ridiculous and has been crazy talk for years.\n\nSince the (absolutely weak) supposition of \"lack of response is suspicious\" in recent published \"fan fictions\"\n\n1) Yes, I've run the SecondLife furry community Luskwood for 21 years,  and still do. Luskwood is PG-rated, and does not permit adult content. Being one of the only NON adult furry areas on SL is what we're known for. Yep, a lot of that goes on in many furry communities. Luskwood does not exist to service that demographic.\n\n2) Yes, \"ScentualLust\" aka (apparently - 'pimpuigi', I didn't know him under that name at all) frequented MANY furry communities, including Luskwood, and for years was a \"hanger on\" trying to get close to the administration of both of the communities I run (Luskwood and Trotsdale.)\n\n3) I considered Scentual/\"Pimpuigi\" to be *personally, a stalker of mine*, as he was continually pushing unwanted sexual overtures at me. Most of my interactions were at a screaming volume and telling him   I wanted nothing to do with his fetishes and fantasies. But *he was infatuated with my character online*.\n\n4) I have NO idea what he did or did not do with people of various ages. I was not \"interactive\" with his sexual trysts - his (ex?) wife seemed upset, often, with his obsession with my character and did purport that he did some 'bad stuff' with underage people. I have NO IDEA if this actually happened, and certainly wasn't even marginally participatory in it.\n\n5) In regards to his ex and her claim that I engaged in misconduct with her: I simply did not. I met her briefly once after being invited to meet their pets, who they were travelling with. During this meeting, they made efforts to engage me in a level of interaction I was very uncomfortable with, as these were two people I was not very close with. After this, and then having to witness an argument between the two of them for about 20 minutes, I took the first opportunity I had to excuse myself and leave. The entire meeting was deeply uncomfortable and I frankly had no desire to stay.\n\n6) Hundreds of people who know me, know that Scentual/ \"pimpuigi\" was someone I had a hard time tolerating, was often repulsed by, and kept at arms length. Whatever he did in his personal life, I was not looped in on, and did not want to be looped in on.\n\n7) John Inubook and friends are using this \"association makes for suspicious questions\" appearance out of convenience. But it is outright, slander and defamatory. And that CAN be proven. The more people try to \"investigate\" these occurrences the more they'll find out I was not involved in any of them, and these people are taking a risk by putting down on 'paper' accusations that are completely and utterly false. All based on gossip, and people with strong ulterior motives. \n\n8) Yes, I'm trans. For many years, I've been afraid to come out - because of Elon's feelings on it, and much of the cryptosphere. Some of the reasons here are on display on social media. (Supposing LGBTQ people 'go after kids' is almost a trope, and a well worn go-to. And it's BS.)\n\n9) My ONLY focus in working with the Dogecoin Foundation is furthering technical developments on LibDogecoin and RadioDoge. (and soon dashb0rd and Core Greenfields Experimental.)  I do not have any stake in or interest in validation methods, or business deals. (Nor have I received ANY payments from corporate partners. If their stock goes up, I get ... nothing.) I consider it a vector that I can use to further community ecosystem projects and that's all.\n\n10) The \"dogecoin\" main has not been 'only me' for quite a long time. For a while, it was. It has not \"changed hands\", but we use Buffer, and a LOT of other groups do too.  I have always been open about wanting community people to give me leads to post on the dogecoin main. It seems to not happen. But all anyone has to do is ask, and if its pertinent to dogecoin and not meant to 'stir drama', I'd be happy to forward it. Please. Send community leads and posts. \n\n11) I absolutely believe that Dogecoin needs to stay consensus-based, open-source, not controlled by central entities. The way I look at is, if the Foundation does something people like, they'll go with it. If they don't, they won't. That's why I feel any attempts on PoS are iffy and not much to worry about. Consensus has to change that. A group cannot force that. (And shouldn't.) I am personally ambivalent about a validation (PoS vs PoW) change, but I do believe that PoW has become overly centralized over the years, and ALL cryptos may need a solution down the line. But not soon, and not urgently. And as I've said, PoS is not \"definitely\" the answer.\n\n12) I also believe that the ecosystem needs to be backed and built, and that some people working full time trying to expand the ecosystem is beneficial and not 'centralizing'. It just allows them to dedicate more life and time to it, which needs to happen if dogecoin acceptance is going to spread. \n\nI'm always open to talk about dogecoin's direction, and want to be open on the matter; but as far as the allegations discussed above, I will NOT be entertaining replies, and I will NOT be speaking further on the matter. These suppositions and allegations lodged at me are absolutely and categorically false.\n\nI'm tired of remaining quiet and being chased out of these spaces due to made up fantasies that 'sound lecherous and juicy'.  They're wholly incorrect, and that's all I have to say on the matter.\n\nBut I do understand it's much more fun and much more exciting to believe the soap opera, even if it's fiction. And make no mistake, it is fiction.","gravity_id":"372156067","id":40745,"createdAt":"2025-12-21T04:40:18.149Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-21T08:50:28.963Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2025-12-21T04:33:08.385Z","text_content":"$DOGE has completed a clear liquidity sweep after a long corrective phase taking out weak hands near major support. \n\n#DOGE is now stabilizing at the lows, and selling momentum appears exhausted.
