This zone has acted as a short-term demand level where price is trying to stabilize. If buyers manage to defend this area and hold above 0.1320, a long opportunity can develop with a potential move back toward 0.1343 and then the upper resistance near 0.1350. Strength above this level would indicate buyers regaining control and opening room for continuation toward higher intraday targets.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if price fails to hold the 0.1320 support and closes below it with momentum, the structure favors a short continuation. The recent strong bearish candle suggests sellers are active, and a breakdown could push $DOGE toward the lower liquidity zone around 0.1300. Any weak bounce into 0.1323–0.1340 that gets rejected again can be considered a short-side opportunity, as long as price stays below the previous resistance levels.\n\n\nShort Outlook:\nAs long as $DOGE trades below 0.1343, the market remains cautious and slightly bearish. Holding above 0.1320 keeps a bounce possible, but a clean break below this level would shift momentum fully in favor of sellers.","gravity_id":"372205334","id":44148,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T20:20:16.897Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-22T23:30:19.926Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2025-12-22T20:34:20.687Z","text_content":"I’m bearish on $DOGE","gravity_id":"372205434","id":44183,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T20:40:16.623Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T00:40:20.607Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2025-12-22T20:44:44.419Z","text_content":"$DOGE Dogecoin is money 😂😂📉📉","gravity_id":"372205486","id":44200,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T20:50:17.836Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T01:00:20.031Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2025-12-22T21:10:45.447Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $DOGE","gravity_id":"372206551","id":44258,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T21:20:17.977Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T04:00:20.667Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2025-12-22T21:10:42.431Z","text_content":"I’m bearish on $DOGE","gravity_id":"372206550","id":44259,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T21:20:18.371Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T01:10:22.527Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2025-12-22T21:33:24.366Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $DOGE","gravity_id":"372207662","id":44301,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T21:40:17.353Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T04:30:19.749Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2025-12-22T21:33:20.719Z","text_content":"I’m bearish on $DOGE","gravity_id":"372208179","id":44302,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T21:40:17.745Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T04:20:21.024Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2025-12-22T21:42:16.656Z","text_content":"$DOGE   is flashing⚡ early bullish signals 👀 As price stabilizes, an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is forming — often a sign of trend reversal.
