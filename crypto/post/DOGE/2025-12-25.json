This is typically where the market starts to show its hand. If buyers step in with strength, a sharp rebound isn’t out of the question. Until then, this remains a wait-and-see area that could shape the next major move.  That same patience is guiding my approach in Bitget’s Crazy 48H Phase 12. In the last phase, sticking to BGB and avoiding forced setups delivered steady BGB rewards. This round puts the spotlight on $UXLINK , with 14,040 BGB available. Less noise, cleaner opportunities, and a chance to quietly accumulate while the wider market searches for direction. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372281377","id":49062,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T16:30:12.314Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T17:50:11.679Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2025-12-25T16:43:37.000Z","text_content":"$DOGE #dogebase woohoo","gravity_id":"372279827","id":49099,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T16:50:11.782Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T17:50:11.071Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2025-12-25T16:43:08.961Z","text_content":"$DOGE if you only knew who the owner is you’d buy in a heartbeat","gravity_id":"372282011","id":49100,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T16:50:11.982Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T17:00:11.223Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2025-12-25T16:42:12.632Z","text_content":"$DOGE buy before its too late #dogebase cuz if you all knew who the owner is you’d buy in a heartbeat #Coinbase listing soon","gravity_id":"372282005","id":49101,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T16:50:12.180Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T17:00:11.418Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2025-12-25T17:26:00.059Z","text_content":"$DOGE  has swept liquidity and is now sitting at strong support after a long correction.
