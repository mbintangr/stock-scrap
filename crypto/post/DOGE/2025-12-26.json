As of late 2025, it has 6,144 followers on X, is fair launch (no premine or team allocation), Proof-of-Work (PoW) security via merge-mining with Litecoin and Dogecoin, low fees, fast transactions, and community-driven growth. \n\nDingocoin made steady progress in 2025, emphasizing technical upgrades, exchange listings, partnerships, and ecosystem expansions. Key achievements are outlined chronologically below, focusing on verifiable developments:\n\nFebruary: Celebrated 4 Years of Operation\nDingocoin marked its fourth anniversary, underscoring its longevity as a community-built project with no premine and ongoing development. The post teased upcoming announcements, reinforcing its status as a resilient PoW memecoin. \n\nMarch: Partnership with ViaBTC for Enhanced Mining Security\nDingocoin partnered with ViaBTC, the world's largest Scrypt mining pool, integrating over 1 million miners to earn DINGO rewards. This boosted network security through massive hashpower and announced upcoming support in CoinEx Wallet, positioning Dingocoin as a key player in Scrypt mining revenue and payments. \n\nMay: Listing on Komodo Wallet and Komodo DEX\nDingocoin was added to Komodo Wallet (a non-custodial, multi-asset wallet available on web, mobile, desktop, and more) and Komodo DEX (a decentralized exchange for peer-to-peer trading). This expanded accessibility with no KYC requirements, emphasizing privacy and decentralization. The achievement was credited to community \"Guardians\" driving the integration.\n\nJuly: Geelong Upgrade Announcement and CoinEx Collaboration\nThe Geelong hard fork upgrade was revealed, set to increase transaction throughput from 33 TPS to 330 TPS while maintaining PoW security—a 10x boost for scalability.  Additionally, an exclusive interview with CoinEx highlighted Dingocoin's fair-launch principles, mining advantages, and listing process, showcasing real-world adoption efforts. \n\nSeptember: Geelong Upgrade Live and Multiple Listings/Promotions\nThe Geelong upgrade successfully activated at block 2,254,540, achieving the 330 TPS milestone with seamless network transition. Node operators and miners were thanked for updating to v1.18.0.0.  \n\nOctober: Exchange Ops\nDingocoin was listed on https://t.co/StnQ9cq6gs for DINGO/USDT trading, with wrapped versions (wDINGO) on Solana, Polygon, and BSC for cross-chain access, including U.S. users. BitMart ran new-user promotions sharing millions of DINGO rewards for KYC-verified sign-ups. \n\nNovember: Positive Momentum from Flip Wallet Partnership\nDingocoin benefited indirectly from NBX's strategic acquisition of 50% stake in Flip Company (behind the Flip non-custodial wallet with 1M+ downloads). Posts celebrated this as a \"new era\" for hybrid custodial/non-custodial ecosystems, with Dingocoin already integrated into Flip, enhancing its utility in the Nordics and beyond. \n\nDecember: Ongoing Building and Community Engagement\nEmphasized continued development with posts like \"WE KEEP BUILDING!\" amid broader crypto celebrations, such as CoinEx's 8th anniversary. Indication in chats about early AMA being prepared with upcoming partnership talks. \n\nOverall, 2025 was a year of maturation for Dingocoin, with a focus on scalability (via upgrades), security (mining partnerships), and accessibility (listings and wallets). The project maintained its decentralized ethos, with community-driven efforts (\"do-ocracy\") credited for progress. \n\n- Dingocoin Guardians \n\n#DINGOCOIN #BTC #DOGE #BNB   #SOL #ETH","gravity_id":"372292318","id":49840,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T04:30:11.498Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T08:50:12.559Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2025-12-26T04:35:29.620Z","text_content":"$DOGE  ALL POWER GUY!!!

Current sentiment: The original memecoin is suffering alongside the broader crypto market downturn.  Key level in focus: $0.20 remains the psychological target for traders before year end.   Why DOGE Struggled in 2025 Market wide crash: Bitcoin and Ethereum absorbed most liquidity, leaving altcoins under pressure.  Speculative nature: Meme coins like DOGE are more vulnerable to sentiment driven sell offs.  Macro backdrop: Global risk off conditions amplified volatility across crypto assets.   Can DOGE Reclaim $0.20? Community strength: Dogecoin’s loyal following continues to drive engagement and visibility.  Potential catalysts: Social media hype, celebrity endorsements, and retail momentum could spark rallies.  Market cycles: Historically, DOGE has rebounded sharply after deep corrections.  ⚠️ Risks  High volatility: DOGE remains prone to sudden swings.  Lack of utility: Fundamental adoption lags compared to other altcoins.  Dependence on sentiment: Price recovery is heavily tied to retail enthusiasm and broader market trends.
