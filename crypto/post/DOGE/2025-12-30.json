Here is why:\n​1. No Maximum Cap (Infinite vs. Finite)\n​You mentioned a \"maximum cap of 168 billion,\" but Dogecoin actually has no maximum supply.  \n​Fixed Inflation: Every year, 5 billion new Dogecoins are created—forever.  \n​The Math: Because the supply grows every year, the \"value\" of each individual coin is constantly being diluted. A Power Law requires a stable, fixed base (like the 21 million BTC) to act as a \"mathematical floor\".  \n​2. Physical System vs. Social Hype\n​The Bitcoin Power Law treats Bitcoin like a growing city (infrastructure and innovation growing with the population).  \n​Bitcoin's \"City\": It has thousands of full-time developers and massive energy-intensive security (mining) that grows predictably over time.\n​Dogecoin's \"Meme\": Dogecoin has very few active developers and its value is driven primarily by social media virality and \"hype\" rather than long-term infrastructure growth. Hype cycles are exponential and unstable, not long-term Power Laws.  \n​3. \"Feature, Not a Bug\"\n​Interestingly, some supporters (like Elon Musk) argue that Dogecoin's inflation is a good thing.  \n​They believe it makes Dogecoin a better transactional currency (spending money) because people are less likely to hoard it.  \n​However, the Power Law is a model for Store of Value (savings). Because Dogecoin is designed to be \"spent,\" it doesn't build up the same mathematical \"monetary energy\" over decades that Bitcoin does.\nThe Verdict: While Dogecoin can have massive price spikes, it doesn't follow the \"Log-Log\" straight line of Bitcoin because its supply isn't fixed and its network growth isn't tied to the same physical laws of energy and time.","gravity_id":"372396633","id":56378,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T21:40:12.875Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T04:00:19.250Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2025-12-29T21:41:58.074Z","text_content":"ONCHAIN PERPS ARE PRINTING MONEY 💰🤯.

After failing to hold above $0.14, this resistance has flipped into a supply zone, while the weekly Gaussian channel has turned red, signaling continued bearish momentum. Weekly RSI shows signs of bullish divergence, but buyers remain tentative.  Trading volume remains steady at $900M–$1.1B, yet it’s insufficient for strong accumulation. Recent rebounds have produced lower highs, suggesting sellers dominate rallies. Until DOGE reclaims $0.138–$0.14 with volume, upside attempts are likely capped.  Outlook for January 2026:  Bullish scenario: Momentum returns and the broader market recovers → DOGE could target $0.20–$0.25.  Bearish/neutral scenario: Weak memecoin interest persists → DOGE may stay below $0.18, with risks down to $0.10–$0.12.
