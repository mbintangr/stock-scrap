DOGE is currently trading at $0.11842 USDT, consolidating directly at a major multi-month horizontal support zone around $0.116–$0.120 after a sharp correction from mid-December highs near $0.160+.  Price action on the 4H timeframe shows prolonged downside with lower highs, but recent candles display tight compression and early higher lows right on this demand area,classic seller exhaustion signals with potential reversal setup emerging as price respects the level amid low holiday volume.  A confirmed close above $0.124 with expanding volume would validate buyer strength, potentially targeting $0.130–$0.135 resistance. Failure to hold $0.116–$0.120 could open deeper downside toward extended supports.  Key Levels  Support zone: $0.116–$0.120 (multi-month pivot, currently testing) Reversal trigger: $0.124 (close above with volume) Upside targets: $0.130–$0.135 Deeper support: dynamic lower (~$0.110–$0.112)  Traders should monitor volume confirmation near support before positioning. Dogecoin ($DOGE ) remains the original meme coin with massive community, high liquidity, and growing real-world payment adoption (e.g., Tesla merch, AMC theaters). Ongoing burns, tipping culture on X, and rotational strength during meme seasons drive volatility and holder loyalty.

Key points Price action: DOGE dropped to around 0.123 dollars on 31 December, its lowest level since November 2024 and roughly 61% below its late‑November peak near 0.48 dollars. ​ Whale selling: Large holders offloaded about 150 million DOGE over five days near the bottom of the recent range, signalling de‑risking rather than a full exit, as some coins were absorbed by other big players and liquidity providers. ​ Support break: Selling pressure pushed DOGE below a critical 0.1248 dollar support on 30 December, with trading volume about 157% above average, showing an aggressive active sell‑off, not just thin liquidity.  ETF and demand Weak ETFs: The new Grayscale Dogecoin Trust and Bitwise Dogecoin ETF have attracted only about 2 million dollars of inflows and around 5 million dollars in total assets since launch in November, versus roughly 1.1 billion dollars into XRP‑focused funds in the same period. ​  Lack of interest: This underperformance “reflects a lack of market interest in Dogecoin,” with Grayscale’s GDOG holding only about 3.8 million dollars as of 30 December, well below early expectations. ​  Market context Derivatives: DOGE futures open interest has fallen from about 5.2 billion dollars earlier this year to roughly 1.48 billion dollars, while daily futures volume collapsed from 60 billion dollars in November to around 2.85 billion dollars and funding has turned negative, showing bearish leveraged sentiment. ​  Meme sector slump: The whole meme coin sector’s market cap is down about 65% from a roughly 100 billion dollar 2024 peak to around 36 billion dollars, with tokens like Shiba Inu, Dogwifhat and Official Trump all down more than 60% from recent highs.  $DOGE","gravity_id":"372469054","id":60803,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T14:20:13.755Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T16:00:25.283Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-01T14:31:26.736Z","text_content":"$DOGE need Jeet 🙏","gravity_id":"372469152","id":60827,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T14:40:20.363Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T14:50:14.620Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-01T14:21:24.509Z","text_content":"I’ve been trading for a while, and one thing that always bothered me was how many apps I had to use.

Market Sentiment: Enthusiasts see DOGE as one of the most promising coins yet to show full strength.  Central Question: Can DOGE finally unlock its potential and deliver a breakout year?  Analysis Dogecoin has spent much of its history consolidating at lower price levels, often dismissed as a meme coin despite its strong community backing. The forecast by Javon Marks suggests 2026 could mark a turning point, with DOGE potentially surging to $0.65  a move that would represent a 400% rally from current levels.  Whether this prediction holds depends on broader market conditions, liquidity inflows, and renewed retail enthusiasm.
