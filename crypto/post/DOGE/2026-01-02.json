If price consolidates above 0.12537 and shows bullish confirmation (like a bullish engulfing or strong push with volume), a long entry could be considered. - First target would be 0.12805, with further upside possible toward 0.13024 and 0.13200 if momentum persists. - Watch for a pullback toward 0.12381 or 0.12256 for possible liquidity grab and demand zone entries if lower timeframes show reversal patterns (such as pin bar or bullish engulfing). - Bias remains bullish as long as price holds above 0.12381.

The chart highlights four distinct structural points (1, 2, 3, 4). We are currently at Point 4, and the structure is rhyming perfectly with the pre-bull run accumulation phases of the past.\n\n1. The Rounding Bottoms (Accumulation):\n\nZones 1 & 2: These were the \"boredom phases\" where volatility died, and smart money accumulated. Zone 2 specifically was the launchpad for the massive 2021 parabolic run.\n\nZone 4 (Current Price Action): We are seeing the exact same rounding bottom formation. The price is stabilizing, forming a heavy base just like it did before the previous explosions.\n\n2. RSI \n\nLook at the RSI indicator at the bottom. The red line (~32. level) acts as a historical floor.\n\nEvery single time the weekly RSI touched or hovered near this baseline (Points 1, 2, and 3), it marked a macro bottom.\n\nRight Now: The RSI has reset back to this critical support level. It indicates that the sellers are exhausted and the momentum is primed to flip.\n\n3. The Verdict: This isn't just random noise; it's a cyclical reset. The chart suggests we are in the \"Golden Pocket\" for accumulation. If the fractal plays out like it did in 2020 (Zone 2), the current price action is simply the calm before the storm.\n\nSummary:\n\nTechnical Structure: Bullish Rounding Bottom.\n\nIndicator: RSI at historical oversold support (Buy Zone).\n\nhttps://t.co/qs6ZWSVEIF","gravity_id":"372484404","id":61915,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T08:50:17.525Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T09:50:16.742Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-02T09:22:45.102Z","text_content":"🐶 Dogecoin vibes: mild bullish momentum, strong social buzz, but a tricky market ahead.

With Firedance and Alpenglow upgrades incoming, Solana's infrastructure advantage widens. As long as Pump.​fun continues to be a token factory, meme coins will be the winners, with @solana reaping huge benefits through network revenue and user growth.\n\n2/6\n💎 Bitcoin Pumps = Meme Season:\n\n🔹 Analysts predict BTC rally in $120K-$170K zone in 2026\n🔹 Fundstrat pushing targets to $400K\n🔹 Institutional capital rewiring crypto's 4-year cycle narrative\n\nIf BTC reclaims $100K+, risk appetite returns, and meme coins historically pump hard in rising tides.\n\n3/6\n🎯 PolitiFi 2.0:\n\nU.S. midterms hit in 2026, political volatility equals PolitiFi meme coin volatility.
