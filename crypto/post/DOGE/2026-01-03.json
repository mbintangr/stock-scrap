Key Recovery Drivers: Technical Breakout: DOGE has successfully flipped a major multi-month resistance into support, clearing the path for a sustained rally. Whale Accumulation: Large-scale transactions (over $100k) have spiked by 35% in the last 72 hours, suggesting \"smart money\" is positioning for a move. Market Dominance: While newer memecoins face high volatility and low liquidity, DOGE remains the primary choice for traders seeking \"high-beta\" exposure with deep market depth. Macro Environment: The shift toward pro-growth economic policies is favoring high-sentiment assets, with $DOGE   acting as a primary gauge for retail risk appetite.  Traders are closely watching the $0.22 level as the next psychological pivot point.
