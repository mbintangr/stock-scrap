Price has reclaimed key intraday levels and is now accelerating with higher highs and higher lows, confirming buyer dominance. The steady expansion in price suggests strength rather than exhaustion, and as long as DOGE holds above the recent breakout area, continuation toward the upper resistance zone remains the higher-probability scenario. This structure favors a long opportunity, especially on minor pullbacks, with momentum clearly aligned to the upside.\n\n\nFrom a short-term trading perspective, any shallow retracement toward the $0.148–$0.146 region can act as a healthy retest and potential long entry zone. Bulls are in control as long as price stays above this demand area, keeping the path open toward the $0.160+ region. However, if $DOGE fails to hold above $0.145 and loses structure, a short opportunity could emerge, targeting a deeper pullback toward previous consolidation levels.\n\n\nShort Outlook:\nBias remains bullish while price holds above $0.145. A sustained move above $0.155 increases the probability of continuation toward $0.160–$0.162, while a breakdown below support would shift momentum toward a short-term corrective phase.","gravity_id":"372536398","id":65283,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T04:20:14.962Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T06:00:17.608Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-04T04:21:56.289Z","text_content":"$DOGE Sell Time 🔥🖖🏻 Cash out\nBearish Time Crypto","gravity_id":"372536500","id":65288,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T04:30:15.275Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T06:00:17.299Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-04T05:18:45.010Z","text_content":"$DOGE Reminder: Don't listen to the moment traders and buy before it's too late.","gravity_id":"372538092","id":65306,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T05:20:15.213Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T06:20:16.457Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-04T04:43:45.041Z","text_content":"Top Meme Coins to Watch Now: APEMARS Whitelist, Dogecoin, and Bonk Are Igniting the Next 100x Crypto Frenzy\n\nhttps://deythere.com/top-crypto-coins-apemars-whitelist-doge-bonk/\n\n#apemars #Crypto #SponsoredArticle ","gravity_id":"372536610","id":65307,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T05:20:15.507Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T06:00:17.108Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-04T05:28:56.661Z","text_content":"$DOGE  is displaying a strong short‑term impulse up from the $0.14 area, with price now stabilizing above recent highs near $0.152.
