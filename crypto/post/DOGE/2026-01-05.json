Analysts Focus on the 0.382 Fib Reclaim  Dogecoin ($DOGE ) has emerged as a top performer this week, but it has reached a \"Moment of Truth\" at $0.148. Following a steep 2025 correction, three prominent analysts—Matt Hughes, Byzantine General, and Cantonese Cat—have weighed in on the current price action.  The $0.117 Support Floor Matt Hughes (@matthughes13) identifies the weekly 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $0.11778 as the line in the sand. As long as DOGE maintains a monthly close above this level, the structure favors a \"higher low\" rather than a continuation of the downtrend.  The Resistance Ahead While the short-term sentiment has improved, Cantonese Cat notes that the yearly \"inside candle\" structure requires a break above $0.154 to invalidate the bearish thesis. If $DOGE   fails to flip the $0.17 resistance into support by mid-January, the risk of a \"Dead Cat Bounce\" remains high, with a potential retracement to the $0.08–$0.10 range. However, with the MACD histogram turning positive for the first time in months, the odds currently lean toward a \"pullback-then-continue\" scenario.  #doge  #dogecoin  #technicalanalysis  #memecoins  #crypto2026","gravity_id":"372572220","id":67296,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T09:20:15.729Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T11:00:34.630Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-05T09:13:47.429Z","text_content":"$DOGEbullish","gravity_id":"372572211","id":67297,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T09:20:16.046Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T11:00:34.907Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-05T09:37:42.437Z","text_content":"$DOGE  a down correction is expected before more UP, it is a normal retracement.","gravity_id":"372573233","id":67327,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T09:40:15.636Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T11:00:34.333Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-05T10:01:00.074Z","text_content":"Here’s Where #Dogecoin  (DOGE) Price Could Go Next as Altseason Approaches $DOGE     https://captainaltcoin.com/heres-where-dogecoin-doge-price-could-go-next-as-altseason-approaches/","gravity_id":"372572766","id":67370,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T10:10:17.106Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T11:20:17.787Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-05T10:28:42.887Z","text_content":"$DOGE showing strong bullish structure 📈\nAfter a sharp impulse, price is consolidating around 0.148 — healthy pullback above demand.\n\n\n🔹 Holding above 0.145–0.140 = bullish continuation\n🔹 Next resistance: 0.155 → 0.160\n🔹 Momentum still favors the bulls\n\n\nPatience pays.
