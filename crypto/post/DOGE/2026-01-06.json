A ~440% bullish wave lasting some 80 days.\n\nYes, additional growth is definitely possible and the most likely scenario.\n\nDogecoin is now bullish as the action closed two days ago above the EMA55 indicator. This opens the doors for mid-term growth. We also have a long-term higher low on this chart, October 2025 vs August 2024, and this opens up a higher high for this newly developing bullish market phase. \n\nAll the chart technicals are favorable for a bullish continuation. The questions we should be asking now should revolve around maximizing profits. \n\nHow to make the most out of this trading pair and chart setup? \n\nIt all depends on your trading style, your risk tolerance, your goals, your capital and even your timing. \n\nAre you in or out? If you are in already, then the trading strategy can be different to someone who is about to enter. \n\nAre you using margin or trading spot? If you are using margin, aiming for the main target is wise but some profits needs to be secured along the way; it all depends on your trading style and risk tolerance.\n\nHow many positions you have open? Are you following capital allocation?\n\nIf only one or two positions, with weak risk control, it is best to sit on the position and let it grow.
