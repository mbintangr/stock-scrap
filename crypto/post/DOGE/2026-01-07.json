After that dump, price didn’t continue bleeding — instead it started moving sideways and forming a small base. This kind of behavior usually shows that sellers are losing strength and buyers are quietly absorbing the supply. The recent candles show stabilization and a slight push up, which supports a possible short-term recovery.\n\nAs long as $DOGE holds above the local support zone, the structure favors a bounce toward the upside targets marked on the chart.
