After months of sideways action, Dogecoin finally broke its range and pushed toward the $0.15 zone 📈. The key detail? Volume followed the price, which means this move has real participation behind it.  Technicals look constructive: • RSI shows bullish interest without overheating • MACD flipped positive, confirming a short-term trend shift • Still below long-term MAs — so the market is watching closely  What’s interesting is what didn’t happen 👀 Whales stayed calm. Large DOGE wallets barely moved, and older coins remain untouched — a sign of low sell pressure. That gives price room to move once demand accelerates.  Add to that rising social activity 🔥 Memecoins are back in the spotlight (PEPE, POPCAT, MOG), and historically when attention heats up, liquidity follows.  Is this a full trend reversal?
