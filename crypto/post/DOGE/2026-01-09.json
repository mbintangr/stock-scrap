From the yearly open, DOGE is already up +21%, recently hitting an 8-week high near $0.156.  Technically, things get interesting 👀 Multiple analysts point to a bullish breakout from a falling wedge, a structure that previously led to strong rallies. DOGE has recovered most of last month’s losses in just days — a clear sign that buyers are stepping back in.  If the bullish pennant confirms and price closes above $0.142, a move toward $0.20 (+40%) becomes realistic — a level lost during Q4 pullbacks.  ⚠️ But risk remains. Lose the $0.118–$0.14 zone, and downside could accelerate, with major support only near $0.08–$0.07.  Bottom line: DOGE is coiled.
