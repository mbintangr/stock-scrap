We’ve already seen one strong expansion, followed by a deep correction, and now price is back at a major support zone that has held before.\nThe key thing to notice is that DOGE is not breaking down aggressively. Every time price comes into this lower range, buyers step in and slow the fall. That usually means smart money is accumulating, not exiting.\n\nThis looks like a repeat of the earlier cycle: sharp move up, heavy pullback, then a long base before the next leg. As long as DOGE holds above this support area, the structure stays healthy and the upside remains open.\n\nIf momentum starts to build from here, the first recovery move can push DOGE back toward the $0.20–$0.25 zone.
