This move comes hot on the heels of auto-effective approval, and positions 21Shares’ ETF alongside Grayscale’s GDOG and Bitwise’s BWOW, further solidifying Dogecoin’s growing presence in mainstream finance. Market analysts suggest this could drive upside momentum in DOGE’s price, as ETFs provide a more accessible entry point for investors who prefer traditional markets.

Despite growing institutional headlines, DOGE continues to trade below key technical thresholds.  At the time of writing, DOGE changes hands near $0.140, up ~2% intraday, signaling short-term bid support but no confirmed trend reversal.  DOGE has been repeatedly rejected near $0.155, a level that has evolved into a clear psychological and technical ceiling. Price action is dominated by doji candles and long upper wicks, pointing to indecision and limited follow-through. Momentum remains flat, suggesting neither side has control.  A daily close above $0.160 would invalidate the current range and open upside toward $0.180–$0.190. Conversely, a breakdown below $0.132 increases the probability of a retest of $0.120. The 20-day EMA continues to act as near-term dynamic support.  Spot Dogecoin ETFs are now a reality in the U.S. market, expanding regulated access and improving DOGE’s institutional optics. However, available data shows no visible surge in sustained inflows yet (exact ETF flow figures remain limited or undisclosed). The market appears to be waiting for confirmation that ETF access translates into real demand, not just narrative strength.  Dogecoin’s legitimacy is improving, but price requires confirmation. Until DOGE reclaims $0.160+ with volume, the market remains in consolidation mode. ETF approval is a structural positive - but price will follow capital, not headlines.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372815113","id":83879,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T16:40:21.146Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T17:50:20.024Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-13T16:32:40.311Z","text_content":"Trade Idea - $DOGE   I don’t usually trade large caps, but after testing new HTF ideas I wanted to share this setup. Price is rotating back into the bullish origin of the Oct ’24 move, a key demand zone.  Back in Oct ’25 we saw a sharp sell off with a deep wick into this level, followed by a strong buy reaction. Although the candle closed bearish, it clearly showed aggressive demand.  Since then, price has gradually bled back into this area with reduced selling pressure. Once inside the demand zone again, we saw another strong reaction, this time breaking bearish structure on the 2D/3D timeframes.  With that shift, we’re now on higher low watch. I’ve marked key levels to either DCA spot or enter leverage trades with clearly defined invalidation. The first level aligns with a HTF breaker block and the 0.618 fib for strong confluence, while the second sits at another HTF breaker.  Additional confluence comes from USDT.D, ideally being at key support as $DOGE  approaches these levels.  Price is currently holding above the 0.5 fib, but as mentioned I’d prefer a deeper pullback for better R/R. If not, I’m happy to skip and move on. #BNBChain#  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372816030","id":83881,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T16:40:21.694Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T17:50:20.454Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-13T17:23:27.626Z","text_content":"that feeling when you close a trade and it immediately goes the direction you wanted pain. just pain.
