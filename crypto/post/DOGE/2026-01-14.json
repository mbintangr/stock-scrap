From a trading point of view, it’s simple. If $DOGE   holds this area and starts pushing again, continuation is in play. If it loses the range and can’t reclaim it, the idea is invalid and there’s no reason to force anything. The chart tells you when you’re wrong.  No hype, no predictions, just reading price and letting the trade come to you.
