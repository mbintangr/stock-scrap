This zone has acted as a strong base in the past, and price is once again respecting it.\n\nYou can clearly see that every time DOGE consolidates near this base, it eventually makes a sharp impulsive move upward. The projected structure suggests a similar move is building, with price gradually forming higher lows before expansion.\n\nFor spot traders, this is a long-term accumulation area.

Clear that level, and DOGE could open the door to $0.16 → $0.195, putting the psychological $0.20 back on the radar.  ETF flows are still quiet for now, but history shows demand tends to follow price, not lead it. If DOGE prints a new local high, it would confirm that the corrective phase is likely over.  Zooming out: some macro models even hint at much higher cycle targets — but for now, the focus is simple 👇 ➡️ Hold support ➡️ Reclaim resistance ➡️ Let momentum do the rest  Memes move fast when sentiment flips 🚀","gravity_id":"372912448","id":89468,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T13:40:14.398Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T17:50:16.060Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-16T14:32:59.653Z","text_content":"$DOGE  Time for new ATH reversal? :)","gravity_id":"372910908","id":89546,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T14:40:14.201Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T15:10:14.658Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-16T14:51:09.256Z","text_content":"$DOGE   is showing early signs of strength as price holds above key support. A clean reclaim of the $0.154–$0.157 zone could open the door for a push toward $0.195, with $0.20 as the psychological target. My personal take: DOGE doesn’t give many second chances. When it breaks, it runs hard. I’m not chasing wicks   I want a strong daily close with volume. If that comes, momentum traders will pile in fast.        #DOGE  #Crypto  #Dogecoin","gravity_id":"372913117","id":89585,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T15:00:13.224Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T17:50:15.871Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-16T15:09:29.265Z","text_content":"$DOGE Price is pulling back into a key demand zone around 0.138–0.136 after a sharp rejection from the supply area near 0.150.

At the same time, rising geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East is tilting attention toward traditional risk assets. Oil has priced in geopolitical premiums, and gold remains supported as a fear-hedge.  Defense and intelligence stocks like Palantir ( $PLTRX  ) are also on watch, especially as market participants look for macro exposure beyond crypto. PLTR is available on Bitget Stock Futures, and macro asset classes such as Gold & Oil are tradable via Bitget TradFi, letting traders express broader themes from one interface.  When markets ebb and flow, opportunities can come from both digital and traditional arenas, worth observing how cross-market signals evolve this week.  #Meme Alpha#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372916049","id":89605,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T15:10:14.110Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T17:50:15.571Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-16T16:34:45.143Z","text_content":"Dogecoin $DOGE Technical Setup Signals Potential Major Move https://memecoin.reviews/dogecoin-technical-setup-signals-potential-major-move/","gravity_id":"372916678","id":89755,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T16:40:14.992Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T17:50:14.981Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-16T16:44:00.083Z","text_content":"$DOGE has completed a liquidity sweep and is now stabilizing in a long consolidation.\nStructure looks ready for a reversal move if price holds demand and reclaims strength.\n\nEntry Zone: 0.138 – 0.142\nBullish Above: 0.146\nStop Loss: 0.127\n\nTP1: 0.170\nTP2: 0.215\nTP3: 0.285\n\nPatience here higher timeframe base often leads to explosive continuation.","gravity_id":"372916734","id":89772,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T16:50:14.502Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T17:50:14.686Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-16T16:55:45.716Z","text_content":"Dogecoin Price Drops 3.5% After Breaking Key $0.14 Support\n\nhttps://thebitjournal.com/dogecoin-price-drops-3-5-after-breaking-key-0-14-support/\n\n#BollingerBands #CryptoMarket #DOGEprice #DOGEresistance #Dogecoinprice #Dogecoinsupport #Fibonaccisupport #memecoins ","gravity_id":"372914860","id":89788,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T17:00:13.554Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T17:50:14.455Z"}]
