But despite Dogecoin being a top 10 crypto giant with a $20 billion market cap, institutional investors are acting surprisingly shy. While you’d expect a \"moon mission,\" the Wall Street appetite for Doge remains \"muted.\"  Since the first Doge ETF debuted in late 2025, these funds have only moved about $200 million in trading volume. To put that in perspective, XRP ETFs which launched around the same time raked in over $2 billion.  Why the cold shoulder⁉️   Experts say Dogecoin doesn’t play by the rules of traditional finance. Its price is fueled by viral memes, community energy, and Elon Musk’s tweets, not by corporate balance sheets.  However, the \"House of Doge\" (the Foundation’s corporate arm) isn't worried. They are playing the long game by focusing on utility over hype. They’re launching a mobile app in 2026 to help merchants accept Doge easily, aiming to turn it into a legitimate global currency.   Plus, companies like Bit Origin and Thumzup are already starting to put DOGE on their balance sheets.  🚨 Wall Street might be slow to join the party, but Dogecoin is busy building the infrastructure to prove it’s more than just a joke. Whether the institutions buy in or not, the \"People’s Coin\" is growing up.  ✅️ FOLLOW FOR MORE ✅️ $DOGE","gravity_id":"373161139","id":104815,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T10:30:19.074Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T14:50:21.215Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-24T10:35:00.092Z","text_content":"$DOGE Sideways base after heavy drop with rebound potential\n\nLong $DOGE\nEntry: 0.1225 – 0.1250\nTP1: 0.1295\nTP2: 0.1350\nTP3: 0.1420\nSL: 0.1198","gravity_id":"373158205","id":104835,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T10:40:20.455Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T15:30:21.420Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-24T10:46:14.600Z","text_content":"BUY $DOGE    Entry: 0.1237  SL: 0.1225  TP1: 0.1253  TP2: 0.1264  Analysis!!

If prices move lower, buy more.\n\nIt can happen that Dogecoin turns bullish this very same week. There can be a wick, like August 2024, or a reversal can happen right away as there is zero bearish volume—buy and hold.\n\nSee here the full trade-numbers. Be careful with the liquidation wick.
