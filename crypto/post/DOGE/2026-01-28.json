He identified that Shiba Inu has kept a key support area throughout its lifespan. Specifically, this demand zone lies around $0.0000068 to $0.0000061.  \r \r \r Shiba Inu retraced to this area following its May 2021 high and has since always returned there after each rally. For context, SHIB rallied to $0.0000885 in October 2021, lost momentum there, and retraced to the support in June 2023.  \r \r After its March 2024 rally to $0.0000456 and another push to $0.0000334 after a brief consolidation, Shiba Inu also dropped to this area.  \r \r The analyst noted that this trend has persisted, with Shiba Inu also maintaining a descending triangle formation. An accompanying chart shows that the token has also broken out of a smaller downward trendline within the broader triangle, suggesting that a price rally is on the horizon.  The commentator compared this price action to that of Dogecoin in 2020. He highlighted a similar trend in DOGE/BTC between early 2017 and late 2021, when the pair also held support around 0.00000016.  DOGE/BTC touched this support several times during this period before a breakout, resulting in an almost 8,000% surge. While the analyst does not expect the exact price rally, he sees Shiba Inu following a similar pattern.  If Shiba Inu mirrors this move, it could reach price levels beyond the current standing. According to the analyst, it could retest its 2021 peak of $0.0000885.  \r \r Before this level are key resistance zones that the token must surpass. Some of them are the March and December 2024 highs. There are also other macro supply zones, like the $0.0000176 resistance, that impeded further rallies in August 2022 and May 2025.  \r \r This outlook is purely based on technical analysis and is not in any way financial advice.

The chart is showing a classic “dip‑then‑lift” structure, hinting at a potential bullish rotation if buyers step in where they usually do.  What the Chart Is Telling Us Support layers: $0.1229 → $0.1218 → $0.1207 DOGE has been respecting these levels, and they’re acting like a springboard zone.  First checkpoint: $0.1306   A reclaim here would be the first sign that momentum is shifting back upward.  Main resistance: $0.1384   That’s the level the projection points toward — the real test for continuation.  Structure Breakdown The pattern is simple but powerful: A small dip into support → liquidity sweep → rotation upward toward $0.1306, and if that breaks, a push into $0.1384 becomes very realistic.  $DOGE  has been moving in clean waves lately, and this setup fits right into that rhythm.  🔥 My Take:   DOGE is sitting in a spot where it doesn’t need to do much to flip bullish again. Hold the support cluster, reclaim $0.1306, and the door to $0.1384 swings open. Lose the support cluster, and the structure softens quickly.  #DOGE  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#  #Meme Alpha#  #Bullish","gravity_id":"373282429","id":106926,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T14:00:14.719Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T15:10:16.514Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-28T14:07:45.095Z","text_content":"DOGE has always been driven by culture and community. 🫂\n\nDogechain provides the execution layer for the DOGE economy.\n\nAn L2 built to support real onchain activity at scale.\n\nThe stack is straightforward:\n\n⛽️DOGE as gas, low fees, high throughput, and reliable settlement.\n\n$DOGE, Operational, with Dogechain as the Execution Layer.","gravity_id":"373282498","id":106950,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T14:10:13.769Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T15:40:16.667Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-28T14:02:44.089Z","text_content":"$DOGE  is trying to decide if it wants to be a good boy or a GREAT BOY 🐕. $ 0.12 holding like my bags 🙌.

The move follows a clean higher-low sequence after a prolonged corrective phase.  Holding above green support at 0.121 keeps the path open toward 0.128–0.130, implying ~2.5–3.5% upside. A loss of 0.121 exposes a ~4% pullback risk. With upside capped by nearby resistance, the setup offers an RRR ≈ 0.9–1.1.  #DOGE  #Dogecoin  #DOGE Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373284387","id":107107,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T15:20:14.557Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T17:30:15.385Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-28T15:12:00.062Z","text_content":"$DOGE  Long Setup After Liquidity Sweep & Base Formation\n\nPrice has flushed stops into strong demand and is now compressing inside a tight consolidation zone, hinting at accumulation before the next upside expansion.\n\n🎯 Targets:\nTP1: 0.15\nTP2: 0.19\nTP3: 0.25","gravity_id":"373284386","id":107108,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T15:20:14.727Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T16:50:15.697Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-28T15:44:00.079Z","text_content":"$DOGE  Weekly Long From Macro Range Low\n\nPrice is holding a massive long-term support zone after a deep correction and is starting to curl upward, suggesting accumulation inside a high-timeframe range before the next major upside leg.\n\nTargets:\nTP1: 0.20\nTP2: 0.32\nTP3: 0.48","gravity_id":"373286051","id":107168,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T15:50:14.168Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T17:50:15.266Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-28T15:41:43.047Z","text_content":"$DOGE Price has flushed stops into strong demand and is now compressing inside a tight consolidation zone, hinting at accumulation before the next upside expansion.\n\n#Dogecoin #Tradingview","gravity_id":"373283546","id":107169,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T15:50:14.470Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T17:50:15.561Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-28T15:49:45.031Z","text_content":"TODAY'S PRIME FOCUS: The future targets for⬇️ \n \n🔮  $DOGE | Dogecoin [@dogecoin]   \n \nFor information only—Not investment advice.
