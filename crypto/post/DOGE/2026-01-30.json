Momentum remains weak, but selling pressure has also slowed, suggesting hesitation rather than panic.  On the chart, DOGE continues to respect a descending trendline that has capped price since November. Each recent bounce has been smaller, keeping the structure fragile.   The $0.105–$0.110 zone stands out as a tight support band. A clean hold could allow stabilization, while a daily close below it risks opening a structurally weaker phase.  On-chain data adds context. Dogecoin network activity reportedly dropped by 94.6%, from 109 to just 6, over the past four weeks, signaling a sharp pullback in large-ticket participation as price probes support.  #Dogecoin","gravity_id":"373320212","id":109880,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T18:20:15.665Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T21:00:17.586Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-29T19:28:45.055Z","text_content":"While $ETH and $DOGE are busy playing hide and seek, $ZKP is throwing a party with 190M tokens daily! 🎉💰  \n\nDon’t miss out: https://bitcoininfonews.com/zkps-stage-2-presale-with-190m-tokens-per-day-draws-major-market-interest-while-eth-doge-lose-momentum  \n\n#Crypto #InvestSmart #ZKP #Bitcoin 🤑🌐 ","gravity_id":"373319588","id":110029,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T19:40:03.626Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T21:00:17.410Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-01-29T19:57:21.497Z","text_content":"$DOGE  Shows #Bullish  Signs Amidst ETF Challenges  Despite a prevailing crypto market downturn and waning interest in its spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), #Dogecoin  (#DOGE ) is exhibiting a bullish technical pattern.
