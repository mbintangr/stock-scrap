That’s where Moonbirds’ evolution into BIRB gets interesting.  What started as a high-end NFT collection is now clearly moving toward something bigger: global, aspirational IP.   Not hype-driven experiments, but a long-term brand play backed by Orange Cap Games (OCG), a team that has already demonstrated how to turn culture into scale with Pudgy Penguins.  This isn’t a reinvention from scratch but rather a continuation of a proven playbook.  Moonbirds already has brand recognition, cultural credibility, and a loyal holder base. Layering tokenized incentives and broader IP ambitions on top of that foundation is how projects graduate from cycles into sustainable ecosystems.  The last thing the market needs is more short-lived narratives.  It should reward teams that can compound attention into global IP with substance.  BIRB isn’t trying to win today’s chart.
