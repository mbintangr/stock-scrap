Trade $DOGE  👉 https://app.stobix.com/futures/DOGE/USDT?utm_source=cmc&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=doge-usdt-futures-2026-02-01   $DOGE  is showing a modest recovery, up +2.83% in the last 24 hours, as traders watch whether price can flip a key resistance zone back into support after last week’s pullback.  📊 Market Snapshot (Feb 1) • Price: $0.105 • 24h range: $0.102 – $0.106 • Market cap: $17.68B • Volume (24h): $1.46B  🧭 Key Technical Levels • Support zone: $0.122 • Immediate resistance: $0.1243 – $0.1255 • Higher resistance: $0.16  📰 What’s Influencing $DOGE  • Failure to hold $0.124 turned this level into short-term resistance • Gate analysis flagged a swing-failure pattern near $0.11, opening room for a rebound if volume increases • Mixed sentiment after: – Launch of the “Such” DOGE payment app – First DOGE ETF listing – Broader market liquidation event adding volatility  📈 Short-Term Outlook • DOGE is still down ~6.7% on the week, reflecting a broader short-term downtrend • Bullish scenario: Break and hold above $0.124–$0.125, with volume confirmation → potential move toward $0.16 • Bearish scenario: Rejection at resistance → retest of the $0.11 swing area • Strategy view: Some traders eye longs near $0.13, with a stop around $0.11 and targets near $0.16  📌 Bottom Line $DOGE  is attempting to stabilize after recent weakness. Bulls need a decisive reclaim of the $0.124 resistance zone to shift momentum back in their favor.

The action is finding support at a long-term ascending trendline; there is a double-bottom with the October 2025 market flush low.\n\nMarket conditions stay the same as before. Dogecoin continues to trade at bottom prices, near support. We can expect a reversal to happen anytime in the coming months. Once we hit bottom, the only place left to go is up.\n\nThere is a classic ABC correction, a really big one. A full bearish cycle is present on this chart lasting more than a year, so far 434 days. Trading volume continues to go down... These are bullish signals within a bearish chart; bullish potential.\n\nPatience is key.\n\nNamaste.","gravity_id":"373436119","id":118593,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T12:30:18.250Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T14:50:20.846Z"},{"crypto_id":"74","crypto_name":"DOGE","post_time":"2026-02-02T12:21:24.264Z","text_content":"$DOGE  Experts predict that 2026 will be the year of ownership coins.
