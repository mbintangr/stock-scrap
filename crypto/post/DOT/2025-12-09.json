Leading the charge (and backed by fresh VC) is Ostium.\n\nHere’s how to use Ostium for trading RWA perps👇\n\n~~ Analysis by @wmpeaster ~~\n\n@OstiumLabs is a perps platform on @arbitrum\nthat offers crypto perpetuals, but it also offers onchain perps for RWAs like commodities (e.g. gold, silver, copper), forex pairs (e.g. EUR/USD, USD/JPY), and stocks (e.g. NVDA, TSLA, MSFT).\n\nThe idea here is that instead of needing multiple brokerage accounts to trade these assets, and instead of waiting for tokenized versions of everything, you can trade synthetic perps, settled on Arbitrum, right from your existing crypto wallet.\n\nIn other words, one venue for everything, with Chainlink oracles handling the crypto price feeds and Stork powering the RWA price feeds. You can access up to 200x leverage on some markets and maintain self-custody with your wallet throughout.\n\nWhile leveraged RWA trading certainly isn't for the faint of heart, it is straightforward to dive into Ostium if you decide to explore the platform further. To finish your first trade:\n\n➢ Head to app (dot) ostium (dot) com/trade. Press \"Connect\" to sign in with an existing Ethereum wallet or use an email to spin up a gasless smart wallet on the spot.\n\n➢ Prepare your funds. USDC is the medium of exchange here. If you've signed in with a wallet loaded on Arbitrum, you're set. Alternatively, use Ostium's \"Add\" button to deposit from a CEX, buy USDC with a credit card, or transfer and bridge other tokens into USDC.\n\n➢ Pick your market. Click the downward arrow tab on the actively listed market to pull up all available markets. Surf across categories like \"Crypto,\" \"Indices,\" \"Forex,\" etc. Then click on the trading pair that catches your eye, e.g. XAU/USD if you want gold exposure.\n\n➢ Choose your parameters. Input your desired settings in the trade interface on the right side: your side (long or short), your order type (market, limit, or stop), your USDC collateral amount, and your leverage level.\n\n➢ Complete and manage your trade. Press \"Buy\" to fire off the transaction. Your position will appear in the \"Trades\" panel beneath the chart, where you can monitor its performance and use the pencil icons to add or remove collateral or update your take-profit and stop-loss levels.\n\n➢ Close your position. Press \"Close\" in your trade panel to exit your trade outright or partially scale out. Ostium lets you define the exact percentage you want to unwind.\n\nBefore you jump in, always approach leverage with caution and stay on top of your USDC collateral levels to avoid liquidations. Also, note that RWAs have non-market hours, so orders placed during these times will queue on Ostium for when those markets reopen.\n\nWith its ongoing points program and over $25B in trade volume so far, Ostium has a chance to rise further into the limelight in 2026. Let's see if the platform can make the most of this opening going forward.","gravity_id":"371776934","id":15088,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T14:50:07.903Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T17:40:09.959Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2025-12-09T14:56:10.092Z","text_content":"$DOT congratulations to Inter Miami and #Messi.
