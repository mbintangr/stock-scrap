Since then, @MagicEden joined this arena by integrating with Collector Crypt, allowing its users to open, trade, and redeem Pokémon cards directly on its marketplace.\n\nHere, you can currently choose from a base Sapphire pack (50 USDC) or a premium Emerald pack (250 USDC). You're most likely to pull cards in the $30-$60 or $150-$250 range respectively, but you could pull cards as valuable as $2k or $10k depending on the pack.\n\nAfter a purchase, a pack graphic will appear that you can click to rip open. Magic Eden will then show you the card you pulled and how much it's worth.\n\nIf you don't like the card, press the \"Take Payout\" button to instantly sell your card back to Magic Eden for 85% (Sapphire) or 90% (Emerald) of its market value. This guaranteed sellback option is only available for the first 72 hours after your buy. Alternatively, hold the card on Magic Eden and list it there later or choose \"Redeem\" to process having the physical version shipped to you.\n\nYet there's not just Pokémon cards to choose from here. Magic Eden has taken this same packs approach and applied it to Ethereum and Solana NFT collections. However, there are some notable differences.\n\nInstead of USDC you pay with ETH or SOL for these NFT packs. And sellback payouts for these pulls are either 90% of the pulled NFT's floor price or 101% of that collection's top offer, depending on which is higher.\n\nThe biggest difference is the sellback window period. Instead of the Pokémon packs' 72 hours, you have 5 minutes to decide whether you want to receive the NFT you pulled or the instant payout.\n\nEverything else works exactly the same besides the fact that NFT packs don't have a redeem option as there's nothing to redeem IRL. The potential upside is higher on the NFT side, however. For example, the premium Promo Ethereum pack offers a chance to win a @pudgypenguins, the floor of which is currently 5.3 ETH or ~$18k.\n\nFeeling lucky?\n\nAnother fun and newer product from Magic Eden is the Lucky Buy system. The idea here is that you can win an NFT for 99% less than its floor value by committing a small amount of SOL.\n\nJoining in is straightforward. Find any NFT on the site that bears the 🍀 badge or head to magiceden (dot) io/luckybuy to find all supported collections. Clicking on the clover badge will bring you into a Lucky Buy interface where you can set your parameters.\n\nYou can set your probability slider as low as 1% or as high as 75%. The lower the slider, the less SOL you'll have to commit, though your winning chances will also be lower. The higher the slider, the more SOL you'll have to commit, but you'll also have a better shot at pulling your target NFT.\n\nPress the \"Lucky Buy\" button and confirm the purchase with your wallet. Magic Eden will run a verifiable randomness function (VRF) onchain to decide the outcome. If your attempt hits, you can keep the NFT or choose \"Payout\" to receive 95% of the NFT's value in SOL.\n\nIf you don't win your target NFT, the SOL you committed will be gone. However, as a consolation, any time your Lucky Buys miss you'll receive a non-transferable Lucky Emmy NFT, and these help boost eligibility in Magic Eden's rewards program.\n\nUnder the hood, Lucky Buy runs on a 5% fee that's layered on top of the listing price. Sellers actually get a small boost (up to +0.75% extra on their listing amount if their NFT sells via Lucky Buy), while a dedicated treasury backstops the gap between what buyers commit and list prices. That's how someone can hit an NFT for, say, 3% of its price without the seller getting rugged.\n\nUltimately, this is a degen way to spend a little and potentially win a lot. It's not groundbreaking, but it's fun to try and doesn't take much time or money. If you're bored onchain lately, it's a light way to take some shots at NFTs without overthinking it.","gravity_id":"371812543","id":17324,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T14:30:06.163Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T17:50:10.984Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2025-12-10T14:49:39.554Z","text_content":"$DOT  the people in here trying to scare everybody.   like cmon now you get nothing out of it lol, and these people that could be buying their dream car wont because you decided to be greedy  congrats hope you've made yourself happy lol   anyways for the people that are here to stay, generational wealth doesnt get created in 50 years of a 401k .  generational wealth starts here.  as a 22 year old that has done the research on $DOT  so you dont have too.   i can say if you are buying DOT you will wanna thank me later,  but you should really thank yourself for holding and stacking up your coins while everyone was saying it will go to zero","gravity_id":"371807884","id":17377,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T14:50:09.629Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T17:50:10.789Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2025-12-10T14:55:04.230Z","text_content":"$DOT  2.200 new resistance, already populated with huge packs of sell orders","gravity_id":"371810826","id":17398,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T15:00:08.781Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T17:50:10.594Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2025-12-10T15:02:14.974Z","text_content":"$DOT  0 volumes trade :D","gravity_id":"371812802","id":17418,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T15:10:09.218Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T17:50:10.321Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2025-12-10T15:55:45.132Z","text_content":"JUST IN: THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL ANNOUNCE ITS RATE DECISION AT 3:00 A.M.
