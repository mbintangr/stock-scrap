Trade $DOT  👉 https://app.stobix.com/futures/DOT/USDT?utm_source=cmc&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=dot-usdt-futures-2025-12-12   $DOT  is trading at $1.99 (-2% in 24h) after breaking below the crucial $2.05 ascending trendline support. The token fell from a high of $2.09 → $1.97, with a massive 284% surge in volume confirming a decisive technical breakdown.  📊 Key Technical Levels • Support: $1.95 → $1.90 • Resistance: $1.985 → $2.00 → $2.05 • Breakout Target: Reclaim $2.00 → retest $2.05 • Downside Risk: Below $1.95 → $1.90 • Long Entry Trigger: Break above $2.00 with strong volume  🔥 Market Highlights • Volume spiked to 10.3M DOT, marking a 284% increase over average daily levels. • The breakdown violated a key ascending trendline, signaling a shift from bullish to bearish structure. • Multiple failed tests at $2.05 confirm this zone as major resistance. • DOT formed an ascending channel between $2.01–$2.09 before encountering heavy sell pressure. • Broader crypto markets were weak, with the CoinDesk 20 index down 0.6%.  📈 Outlook A reclaim of $2.00 is needed for any short-term recovery.
