The project solves one of the key problems of Web3 — the fragmentation of ecosystems — by allowing different blockchains to interact through parachains and the shared security of the Relay Chain. DOT is a tool for managing, staking, and supporting the entire infrastructure.  $DOT   is currently trading at around $1.88. Over the past 24 hours, the price has been adjusting, the 7-day dynamics remain weak, and over the 30-day period, a gradual shift to a downward range is visible. Volumes are declining — the market is acting cautiously, without aggressive purchases, which is typical for the waiting phase.  On the 4H chart, the structure looks bearish: a series of lower highs and lows. Key support is $1.85–1.80, and losing it could open the way to $1.65. Resistance is located in the $2.05–2.15 zone, and above that at $2.30. As long as the price is below $2.15, the growth is perceived as a local rebound rather than a trend reversal.  In the medium term, the baseline scenario is sideways movement with increased volatility. The probability of continued pressure is estimated at 55–60%, but Polkadot's fundamentals remain strong. Interest in modular and interoperable solutions directly intersects with the development of DeFi, including ecosystems such as TON, where scalability and speed come to the fore.  🧭 Market volatility is an opportunity for the DeFi approach, not a reason to panic. On the DEX STONfi on the TON network, such periods are often used for flexible position management: swaps without intermediaries, working with liquidity and commissions, and quick reactions to market changes.  STONfi fits organically into the trend of decentralization: transparent smart contracts, user control of funds, and the high speed of TON make DeFi tools practical rather than theoretical.
