To compete with chains like Solana or Ethereum, the project must address four major challenges:\r \r 1️⃣ Reform Governance (OpenGov): ⚖️ The experience of total direct democracy is showing its limitations. Polkadot must streamline its treasury spending (often deemed excessive in marketing) and combat voter fatigue to regain investor confidence. Where are the result for all the marketing expenses, influencer bounties, marketing bounties, treasury spends for hackathons?\r \r \r \r 2️⃣ Implement JAM : 🧠 This is the technological challenge of 2025. If JAM succeeds, Polkadot will reach new heights; if it fails, it risks becoming technologically obsolete. The developpement of JAM will require a vast amount of money (Around 10M DOT), if price keep printing new lows has it is doing since October the project might have some difficulties to finance all the devs. This is an issue that prove that DOT price is actually relevant, and this should be talked about publicly by Gavin Wood himself or Parity.\r \r 3️⃣ Stabilize Tokenomics: 💎 The major innovation is the shift from infinite inflation to a maximum cap of 2.1 billion DOT tokens. Making the asset scarcer is essential to transforming DOT, currently perceived as a simple staking token, into a true store of value and computing resource. This can also led to a dump in price action when staking rewards will me cut in march 2026 4️⃣ Killer App : ☠️ Polkadot has no killer app, most of its projects has left or migrated to other chains or simply died by lacking of users/developpers. Currently there is only one narrative about a Polkadot App, but numerous delaying of the release has strongly impacted holders trust in the team capacity to actually devellop this kind of application.","gravity_id":"372069190","id":35121,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T13:10:13.761Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T17:00:13.127Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2025-12-18T13:01:00.053Z","text_content":"🚀 $DOT  attempts to base after prolonged pressure.
