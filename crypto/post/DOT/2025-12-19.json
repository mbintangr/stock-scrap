Even major tokens like $DOT  and $ARB  need to fight for attention every day.   You can have: • real users and real world impact • real revenue paths • real long-term vision  And still lose mindshare to pure speculation.  Teams like Camp Network are grinding, building IP primitives, automating royalties, enabling creators to own and monetize their work onchain.  That’s trillion-dollar impact territory.  But the timeline? Too busy chasing 30-minute narratives and influencer drama.  Crypto doesn’t reward patience in the moment.  It rewards it later.
