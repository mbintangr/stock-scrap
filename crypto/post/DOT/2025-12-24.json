It means the devs are heavily focusing on the tech and ignoring the price. Just my two cents. Plus we might see a correction to 3$ soon cuz it's impossible to keep dropping for 3-4 consecutive months without consolidating to the upside even if the final target is 0.5$ for this coin. There is nothing such as pump to 4$ from here by one single 1d candle or dump to 0.5$ by one single 1d candle unless it's a scam and I believe Polkadot isn's scam. Nothing of it looks like scam. Scam coins are pretty obvious by their price movement , fundementals etc. Don't believe whoever claims it's going to 0.5$ or 1$ tomorrow or soon and don't believe whoever claims it will hit 10$-20$ tomorrow or soon even if it consolidates this late crash and tests 3$-4$. None of them knows sh about F. We have a target, possibly 1$ but not if we don't retest 3$ first and possibly 4$. This is bear market or downtrend correct but no red candles are followed by red candles for ever, there are green days ahead and I assume that's Jan and Feb to consolidate this dump then from there down we go.","gravity_id":"372244594","id":46914,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T06:50:08.769Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T12:43:01.110Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2025-12-24T07:19:45.031Z","text_content":"#Polkadot's DOT slips 4.5% as token underperforms wider crypto markets \n\nDOT is facing pressure as it tries to retake the $1.76 support/resistance level.
