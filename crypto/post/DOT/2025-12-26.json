Polkadot is currently below Keltner Channel on 1W timeframe. If Dot closed below 1.8$ this week, then the first two weeks of Jan will be blood for Polkadot BUT on the other hands, the great news is last time Polkadot touched the bottom of KC on 1W timeframe was 9th October 2023 on Mon which sent the price from 3.5$ to 12$ and it happened before that which was in the bear market 2022 on 26th Dec 2022 on monday and even though it was the bear market and worst time of the market but still it sent the price from 4.25$ to 7.9$.
