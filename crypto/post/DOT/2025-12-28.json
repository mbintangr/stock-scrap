Investors are using this time to review positions and track momentum without rushing trades. Boxing Day, celebrated on Dec 26, originates from a centuries-old tradition where “Christmas boxes” of gifts, money, or food were given to servants and the less fortunate, a reminder of generosity and goodwill. Today, it blends history with modern leisure: family gatherings, sporting events, leftover feasts, and blockbuster post-Christmas sales keep the festive spirit alive. A calm market and Boxing Day’s reflective vibe make this an ideal moment to observe trends, study structure, and plan strategies for the week ahead.\n#Boxing #BoxingDay #BingX #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372336549","id":52828,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T19:00:09.712Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T21:40:09.943Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2025-12-27T18:54:31.105Z","text_content":"20,000,000+ unique accounts  That’s all in total across the $DOT  ecosystem  With AI focuses on peaq, gaming on Mythos, and much more, there’s a huge influx of people into the Polkadot ecosystem at this time of year  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372333986","id":52829,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T19:00:09.983Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T21:20:10.596Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2025-12-27T18:50:34.845Z","text_content":"$DOT 5x spring 2026","gravity_id":"372336515","id":52830,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T19:00:10.199Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T21:10:10.591Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2025-12-27T19:06:10.895Z","text_content":"$DOT 1000 USD SOON!!! 🚀🚀🚀","gravity_id":"372336581","id":52840,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T19:10:08.491Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T22:20:11.493Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2025-12-27T19:03:33.312Z","text_content":"$30B+ Secured Across Scaling Layers  $MNT  is pushing the Ethereum L2 narrative forward, focusing on throughput, cost efficiency, $DOT  approaches scaling from a different angle, emphasizing interoperability and shared security so multiple chains can operate as part of a coordinated system rather than in isolation.

DOT is trading around $1.84, showing moderate growth of about +0.7% over the day. Over the past 7 days, the price has remained sideways after a prolonged decline, and over the past 30 days, DOT has lost a significant part of its value, entering a stabilization phase. The market is clearly looking for equilibrium after pressure from sellers. 📉 The 4H chart indicates a downward trend with a gradual slowdown. Key support has formed in the $1.75–1.80 zone, where the price has already found demand several times. Resistance is located in the $1.95–2.05 range, where seller activity is still high. The narrowing of the range and the decline in momentum indicate a possible accumulation. The probability of a local growth while maintaining support is estimated at approximately 55–60%.  🔍 Fundamentally, Polkadot remains an important infrastructure project for Web3 and cross-chain interaction. However, investor interest is shifting towards more flexible DeFi ecosystems, where speed, liquidity, and simplicity play a key role — this is where TON is increasingly mentioned. ⚡️ Against the backdrop of a volatile market, STONfi, a DEX in the TON ecosystem, is gaining more and more attention. Unlike CEX, exchanges here take place directly through smart contracts: without custodial risks, freezes, or manual restrictions. TON's high throughput allows transactions to be carried out almost instantly, which is especially important during periods of sharp price movements. 🌊 The volatility we see in DOT is not only a risk but also an opportunity for DeFi strategies. STONfi provides a tool for rapid asset rebalancing, liquidity management, and 24/7 market trading, while remaining completely decentralized.  👉 Try trading on STONfi — no CEX fees or restrictions 🌊 #Polkadot  #DEX","gravity_id":"372337482","id":52984,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T20:50:09.196Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T23:50:11.248Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2025-12-27T20:46:37.573Z","text_content":"$DOT bullish","gravity_id":"372337464","id":52985,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T20:50:09.420Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T23:40:11.112Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2025-12-27T21:13:11.771Z","text_content":"$DOT so bullish !!\nTop 10 incoming 🔥📈🚀\nPARABOLIC !
