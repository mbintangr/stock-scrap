Buyers have stepped in aggressively after the recent pullback, and the current consolidation near $2.13 suggests strength rather than exhaustion. As long as DOT holds above the $2.08 support region, the bullish structure remains intact, opening the door for a continuation move toward the $2.20–$2.28 resistance band. A clean push above the recent high would likely accelerate upside momentum, favoring a long trade opportunity with dips being bought.\n\n\nOn the flip side, failure to sustain above $2.10 could invite short-term profit-taking. If DOT loses this support with strong selling pressure, price may retrace back toward the $2.02–$2.00 demand zone, where buyers previously defended aggressively. That scenario would favor a short trade opportunity on rejection from the upper resistance, targeting a controlled pullback rather than a trend reversal. Overall structure still leans bullish unless $2.00 is decisively broken.\n\n\nShort Outlook: Bias remains bullish above $2.08, with upside continuation favored; caution only if price rejects sharply from $2.20–$2.28 and loses near-term support.","gravity_id":"372525559","id":64518,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T16:50:11.271Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T17:50:12.033Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2026-01-03T17:12:57.435Z","text_content":"$BTC  is approaching a major inflection point 📊 The 200-day moving average remains the critical level to watch.
