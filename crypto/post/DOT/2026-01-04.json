Wait for clear confirmation before entering.\r - If price loses 2.112, expect a drop first toward 2.033, and if that breaks, next targets are 1.979 and 1.928.\r - For a low-risk trade, wait for manipulation or liquidity grab below the recent swing low (2.093 area) and a quick reclaim. If confirmed, consider a long toward 2.149/2.176, placing stops below the swing low.\r - If price rallies without strong confirmation and faces rejection at 2.149 or 2.176, look for short setups with targets at 2.112 and 2.033.\r - My bias stays bearish unless price shows strong bullish structure above...\r \r 📊 Get detailed free analysis of any coin on any timeframe you want.
