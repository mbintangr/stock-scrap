That momentum is exactly what hVM taps into.  hVM is Hemi’s EVM-compatible execution layer, designed so builders can deploy Solidity-based apps while operating inside a Bitcoin-aligned environment. The workflows feel familiar, but the foundation changes. Apps can access Bitcoin-secured liquidity and BTC-native yield without forcing developers to relearn their entire stack.  For teams already building on OP or ARB-style environments, hVM enables BTCFi. Same contracts. Same tooling. A much larger capital base.  This is how Bitcoin starts speaking the language of modern DeFi, without asking builders to start from scratch.  #Altcoin Season#  #DeFi","gravity_id":"372754812","id":80030,"createdAt":"2026-01-11T18:00:16.830Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T15:00:16.818Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2026-01-11T18:37:57.457Z","text_content":"$DOT Dot ⬇️⬇️","gravity_id":"372756669","id":80081,"createdAt":"2026-01-11T18:40:15.378Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T16:00:24.563Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2026-01-11T18:41:16.784Z","text_content":"#Bitcoin  Bulls in denial?

As the attached chart shows, whether it's Polkadot or Avalanche, most of the top 100 tokens move in the same trend. \n\nThis reality has indirectly shaped the current focus of Cosmos leadership - whether they say it or not, they realize that the price action of ATOM has not had any correlation to the opinions about the fading energy of the Cosmos ecosystem. The Cosmos leadership priority has clearly shifted toward the SDK itself. While this focus on the SDK is technically sound (and exactly why Sentinel chose Cosmos for its sovereign architecture), it has left a gap in ecosystem stewardship.\n\nEven vocal critics of the current Cosmos state, such as Ansem @blknoiz06 , continue to distinguish Sentinel from the pack. While he has been vocal about the ecosystem's stagnation and the need to look elsewhere, his  long-standing support for Sentinel hasn't wavered. The Cosmos leadership has to spend time to take feedback from prominent thought leaders and understand what the overall ecosystem's perception of Cosmos and ATOM is. \n\nSince the time of the Luna/UST crash, we’ve seen the Cosmos SDK stack get adopted, but the brand has struggled to find its footing amidst leadership changes and changes in the overall market dynamics such as localization of attention to just a few chains due to the memecoin wave and other factors. We’ve seen top-tier projects like Akash migrate away from the Cosmos ecosystem in order to ensure that their ecosystem does not lose out on mindshare. \n\nFor Sentinel, the stance is clear: The Cosmos SDK remains second to none. Its scalability, sovereignty, and application layer design are unmatched for what we are building.\n\nSentinel’s future home is a decision we are weighing carefully. But one thing is decided: Sentinel will continue to operate its chain on the Cosmos SDK. Whether our native coin lives on its own Cosmos chain or bridges elsewhere, the technology that powers our decentralized VPN network isn't going anywhere.\n\nSentinel's bet on the Cosmos-SDK stack is not changing. Wherever the price of Sentinel's native token P2P goes while Sentinel is still in the Cosmos ecosystem, the community can be assured that tokens that are sold low will be transferring to longer term holders amidst this period of capitulation. Sentinel was established in 2018 and has gone through many tumultuous challenges over the years from internal and external factors and Sentinel will evolve to face any obstacles and persevere and climb to new heights as it has every cycle.\n\nThe time for Sentinel is NOW.\n\nThe Elon vs. Zuckerberg conflict over the Onavo VPN scandal has  validated Sentinel’s long-standing thesis that centralized VPNs are data traps and not privacy tools. The mainstream is finally waking up to the  need for decentralized, trustless alternatives. \n\nSentinel is shifting its focus to revenue after years of protocol development. On the dVPN side, the key focus is the introduction of new node hardware specifications and performance metering functions to properly categorize nodes for selection and payment by white-label dVPN application owners. Once white-label owners understand the cost to provide a consistent 10-15+ MBpS connection for each active user, application owners will then be able to understand their unit economics.\n\nAs LLMs face lawsuits and data restrictions, decentralized scraping is the next frontier. Sentinel Scout is launching to the public with a seamless payment gateway at a competitive rate.\n\nThe Sentinel ecosystem is going to grow exponentially in the year of 2026 in conjunction with both the decentralized VPN and decentralized data scraping sectors. Sentinel will survive, whether it is in the Cosmos ecosystem or in another ecosystem. The Sentinel chain will remain as is, whether its consensus is POS or POA.","gravity_id":"372780545","id":81645,"createdAt":"2026-01-12T14:50:13.775Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T17:50:17.235Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2026-01-12T15:08:29.657Z","text_content":"$DOT lets support WUD meme on Polkadot.","gravity_id":"372779697","id":81690,"createdAt":"2026-01-12T15:10:13.164Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T17:50:16.818Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2026-01-12T16:03:25.197Z","text_content":"$DOT STRONG AND BULLISH 🔥📈🚀","gravity_id":"372783017","id":81805,"createdAt":"2026-01-12T16:10:13.961Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T17:50:16.411Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2026-01-12T17:10:41.316Z","text_content":"$DOT Time for this pig to move.","gravity_id":"372783406","id":81945,"createdAt":"2026-01-12T17:20:15.512Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T17:50:16.006Z"}]
