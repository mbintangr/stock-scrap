Yields depend on assets (ETH, SOL, stablecoins), lock-up periods, and market conditions—typically ranging from 4-18% APY for staking, higher for structured options.  Staking locks tokens in Proof-of-Stake networks for rewards. Kraken often leads with competitive rates on major assets like $ETH   or $DOT  , while Bitget provides flexible and fixed options across many coins. Savings/Earn features allow easy deposits for daily yields, especially on stablecoins (USDT/USDC). Binance and Bitget stand out with strong APYs (up to double-digits on select products), offering flexibility for quick access or locked terms for better returns.  Structured products like Dual Investment or Shark Fin add potential upside (sometimes >20%) tied to price ranges, with Bitget excelling in variety and user-friendly integration for diversified strategies.   • Security remains key: Bitget emphasizes regular proof-of-reserves, high reserve ratios, and a solid protection fund.  • Kraken prioritizes regulation and audits, OSL focuses on institutional-grade compliance, while Binance offers broad liquidity but adapts to regional rules.  Overall, Bitget and Binance frequently top lists for balanced yields, features, and ecosystem depth. Kraken suits regulation-focused users, Coinbase/Bitpanda appeal to beginners with simplicity.  Always check live rates (they fluctuate), enable 2FA, and only risk what you can afford. Diversify across methods for stability.
