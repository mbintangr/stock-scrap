After the drop from the 2.05 area, DOT found a clear bottom around 1.87 and bounced nicely from there. Since then, price hasn’t really shown panic or aggressive selling, instead, it’s been moving sideways with choppy candles, which usually signals stabilization rather than weakness.  Right now, DOT is trading around 1.92–1.93, sitting right in the middle of this short-term range. This isn’t a breakout zone, but it is where the market decides whether it wants to build a base or roll over again. So far, sellers don’t seem to have strong follow-through.  The key level to watch on the downside is still 1.88–1.90. As long as that zone holds, the structure remains intact. On the upside, 1.98–2.00 is the level that needs to be reclaimed for momentum to really shift back bullish. A clean break and hold above that area would change the tone quickly.  This kind of market favors patience and clean execution, and for traders, it helps that DOT trades with zero fee on MEXC, which makes managing positions during ranges like this a lot more efficient.  No hype, just reading what the chart is showing right now. Let’s see if DOT can turn this consolidation into something more 👀  ﻿#Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373144236","id":103939,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T20:30:14.269Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T05:50:17.064Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2026-01-23T21:07:08.166Z","text_content":"🔴 $DOT  Holds Support — Can Polkadot Reclaim $2.00 for a Breakout?

It's an exciting time for Polkadot as the runtime upgrade 2.0.5 gets set to implement on January 27th. This brings smart contracts fully live with EVM and PVM support, opening up new possibilities for developers and users alike.  Why this upgrade matters now  - Seamless EVM compatibility means easier migration for Ethereum-based projects   - PVM adds Polkadot's unique parachain efficiency for more scalable dApps   - Overall, it strengthens Polkadot's position in multi-chain ecosystems    The referenda has already been approved, so the countdown is real – just a few days left until this goes live. Traders are buzzing with bullish sentiment, seeing this as a catalyst for fresh momentum in DOT.  STONfi on TON provides a complementary edge with its own fast, low-cost smart contract environment that's already powering vibrant DeFi activity. While Polkadot evolves its multi-chain vision, TON's speed and Telegram integration make @ston_fi  an ideal spot for cross-chain liquidity and farming. This synergy lets users bridge ecosystems efficiently, capturing value from upgrades like these without high fees.  Are you feeling bullish on DOT this week with the upgrade so close?
