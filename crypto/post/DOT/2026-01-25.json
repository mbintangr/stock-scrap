This phase highlights where buyers and sellers are finding balance and often precedes the next meaningful move. Accumulation zones like this can act as springboards for bullish momentum if conditions align.  🚨 Why this matters:  • Maintaining the base is crucial for potential upside and sets the stage for a breakout above the descending trendline. • Confirmation signals, such as rising volume, bullish candlestick formations, and positive momentum indicators, can validate a genuine breakout. • Observing broader market trends, including movements in major altcoins and Bitcoin, helps provide context for DOT’s next steps.  🚨 Possible scenarios:  1⃣ Base Holds: If DOT maintains this accumulation range, a breakout above the descending trendline could flip momentum back in favor of bulls, opening the door to higher price levels.  2⃣ Base Breaks: A drop below the lower boundary would invalidate this bullish scenario and could trigger further downside. Traders should manage risk carefully with stop-losses and position sizing.  💎 Meanwhile, the TON ecosystem continues to thrive, and STONfi remains at the heart of its DeFi growth.
