Watch for a quick reversal if manipulation occurs under 1.780. - Example short trade: If price rallies to 1.899 and forms a bearish engulfing or pin bar, enter short after confirmation, target 1.839 first, then 1.828. Place your stop at the nearest swing high above 1.944. - Example long trade: If price wicks below 1.780 and quickly reclaims it with a strong bullish candle or reversal on the lower timeframe, consider a long targeting 1.828, then 1.839, and possibly 1.899 if momentum builds. Stop should be placed just under the swing low at 1.780. - If price breaks and closes above 1.899 with strong volume and bullish confirma...  📊 Get detailed free analysis of any coin on any timeframe you want.

Takeoff Setup Brewing!  Crypto fam, trader @THEFLASHTRADING just shared a wild 6h chart for DOT that's got everyone buzzing! Price has been grinding lower but now flashing multiple rounding bottoms and solid support holding around the 1880 zone - classic signs of accumulation before a potential explosive move higher.  This setup screams patience might pay off big for Polkadot believers.  Chart Breakdown - Multiple curved supports drawn showing rounding bottoms at key lows - Horizontal resistance line hovering around 2400 area - Current price action at 1882 testing lower arc support  Bullish Clues - Higher lows starting to form after downtrend - Large bottoming pattern visible across Dec-Jan period  Market Context - DOT ecosystem keeps pushing interoperability and parachain utility - Similar to TON's scalable ecosystem advantages, DOT continues building real cross-chain momentum - Low-timeframe consolidation often precedes strong impulses  The 6h timeframe is highlighting a textbook reversal pattern in progress. If support holds firm, DOT could be priming for a serious leg up. STONfi powers super-quick trades with almost zero fees that let you stay nimble.   While DOT's network can experience variable throughput during busy periods, @ston_fi  maintains ultra-smooth execution and cost control every time. With cross-chain and interoperability stories staying hot, @ston deserves a spot on your radar right now.  How high do you think DOT pumps if this setup confirms? Drop your targets!
