This structure often signals the early stages of a larger bullish trend, especially when corrections stay shallow and within key support levels.  ❓Why this matters:  • Price is holding the 1.82 support, which is critical to maintain bullish structure. • The pullback appears healthy and corrective, rather than trend-reversing. • Invalidation sits at 1.65 - a clean break below this level would negate the bullish thesis and suggest a deeper correction.  👀 Possible scenarios:  1⃣ Support Holds: A strong reaction from 1.82 could trigger the next impulsive leg higher, with an initial upside target around 2.30. Acceptance above this level would confirm strength and open the door for broader trend continuation.  2⃣ Support Fails: A breakdown below 1.65 would invalidate the bullish structure, highlighting the need for caution and proper risk management.  🔷 Meanwhile, STONfi continues to drive TON DeFi growth, providing traders and builders with a secure, efficient, and highly liquid environment.

The price is currently below the balance and has just lost the support at 1.831, with next important demand at 1.780. - If price sweeps liquidity below 1.780 and shows a strong bullish confirmation (like a pin bar or bullish engulfing on lower timeframes), a long scalp setup could be considered, targeting 1.828 and possibly 1.857 for partial profits. - As long as price stays under 1.831 and fails to reclaim it with momentum, I would not look for longs. If price retests 1.831-1.849 and gives a clear reversal signal (like a rejection candle), a short setup towards 1.780 is possible. - If price breaks and holds above 1.857, my bias flips bullish for a move up to 1.889 and 1.944. - Entry should always wait for confirmation, not just touch-trading the levels.
