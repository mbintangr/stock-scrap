Upside to 2.30 Incoming! 🚀  DOT fans, fresh TA from Rami Scalps spots a clean 5-wave impulse up on DOT followed by a corrective pullback that's holding strong at 1.82 support.

As long as support sticks, the bullish case stays alive - perfect for TON ecosystem watchers eyeing cross-chain plays.

Broader Implications - Acceptance above 2.30 opens doors to extended gains. - Aligns with altcoin recovery narratives in play. - Chart visuals highlight precise entry zones.

The drop in price is attributed to a slight pullback in market sentiment, despite 24-hour trading volume reaching $181.24 million, a 33.25% rise from the previous day.  With a market cap of $2.84 billion, Polkadot’s price movement is relatively stable, but the decline reflects broader market conditions rather than specific project-related factors. The volume-to-market-cap ratio of 6.36% indicates moderate liquidity, suggesting that the price drop is not due to any liquidity issues but possibly driven by profit-taking or market-wide adjustments.  Polkadot’s circulating supply of 1.66 billion DOT makes up its entire supply, and with an unlocked market cap of $2.85 billion, the project remains in a relatively stable position.  Today’s price decline likely reflects short-term market fluctuations rather than any significant changes in the Polkadot ecosystem or its fundamentals.
