The drop below the 7-day SMA and key Fib level at $1.65 triggered sell-side momentum, with RSI deeply oversold near 27 but MACD still expanding to the downside—suggesting weakness hasn’t fully exhausted.   While Polkadot’s treasury efficiency and governance progress remain structurally positive, declining developer activity and user adoption continue to create a disconnect between fundamentals and price, especially in a risk-off market where Bitcoin dominance is rising.   With limited support until $1.46, bulls now need a strong reclaim of $1.65 to ease downside pressure—can $DOT  stabilize here, or does the market need a broader sentiment shift before buyers step back in? ﻿#Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"373401255","id":115415,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T00:50:13.540Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T09:00:17.349Z"},{"crypto_id":"6636","crypto_name":"DOT","post_time":"2026-02-01T02:13:54.893Z","text_content":"$DOT I bought at 1.48$.

Price recently found short-term support near 1.58 and resistance around 1.85, defining the prevailing consolidation range. Within this zone, momentum remains limited, signaling indecision between buyers and sellers.  ❗️ Why this matters:  • A breakout above 1.85 with rising volume would indicate buyers gaining control and could push price toward the next resistance zone around 2.10. • Conversely, a breakdown below 1.58 with increasing volume would suggest sellers are in control, exposing downside risk toward 1.40. • Neutral momentum indicators like RSI and MACD reflect consolidation, highlighting the importance of watching range boundaries and volume for actionable signals.  👀 Possible scenarios:  1⃣ Breakout: Sustained movement above 1.85 could trigger the first upside target near 2.10, offering a high-probability continuation opportunity.  2⃣ Breakdown: A decisive close below 1.58 may expose DOT to the next significant support around 1.40, emphasizing risk management and disciplined trading.  🔷 Meanwhile, STONfi strengthens the TON DeFi ecosystem, providing traders with the tools to efficiently navigate setups like DOT’s. With deep liquidity, permissionless swaps, ultra-low fees, and fast execution, @ston_fi  ensures seamless trade execution and capital efficiency. Transparent mechanics, advanced farming opportunities, and continuous upgrades make STONfi one of the most dynamic and reliable DEXs on TON.  DOT remains in a pivotal consolidation phase.

Polkadot is one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in crypto. Its key idea is interoperability: a network of parachains where different blockchains can securely exchange data and assets. DOT is needed for staking, governance, and connecting new parachains — without it, the ecosystem simply does not work.  Current dynamics At the time of analysis, $DOT  is trading around $1.54, showing a decline of approximately -5% over 24 hours, about -12% over 7 days, and more than -30% over the month. The 4H chart clearly shows a downtrend: the sequence of lower highs and lower lows has continued since mid-January.  🔎 Levels and technicals The key support level is now $1.50–1.48, from which the price has already attempted to rebound. Below that is a risk zone around $1.40. Resistance levels are $1.70 and $1.90, where selling pressure has previously intensified. Volumes increased during the decline, which indicates capitulation sentiment, but also often precedes a consolidation phase. In the medium term, the probability of sideways movement or a technical rebound is estimated at 55–60%, provided the market stabilizes.  🌐 DeFi context and interest in TON While large L1s are undergoing a correction, attention is increasingly shifting to faster and cheaper DeFi networks. Here, the TON ecosystem comes to the fore, where user activity continues to grow even during volatile periods.   STONfi: next-generation speed and architecture STONfi is a key DEX in TON, built with a focus on scalability and minimal fees. Thanks to TON's asynchronous architecture and parallel transaction processing, exchanges on STONfi are almost instantaneous — without the usual “freezes” and overloads familiar from EVM networks.   Technical events and details The latest STONfi updates have enhanced liquidity pool operations and optimized swap routing, reducing slippage during high volatility.
