The chart indicates that $ETH   has returned to a mid-range support band near 2,879 after a series of failed attempts to stabilise above higher liquidity layers.  Price action shows that the corrective structure remains intact. The inability to hold above the 3,200–3,435 resistance cluster signals that sellers continue to dominate short-term momentum. Every attempt to recover into the mid-range has been met with supply, pushing ETH back toward deeper support around 2,637 — a level that has historically acted as both a rejection and accumulation area.  A confirmed daily close below 2,637 could expose lower demand zones extending toward 2,111 and even 1,985, where the chart highlights larger historical reaction points. On the upside, stabilization above 2,879 may enable ETH to retest 3,200 and 3,435. These zones remain untested supply pockets and will likely determine whether the market can transition from correction into neutrality. A decisive reclaim above 3,435 would shift momentum and open the door to the broader 4,000 region.  For Social Miners, the present structure emphasizes observation rather than prediction. Market behavior is currently shaped by macro uncertainty, liquidity imbalances, and sentiment shifts, all of which inform how structural levels react.

However, this move occurred on comparatively lower volume and has now stalled precisely at the critical $3000 resistance zone. While daily and 4-hour momentum indicators have turned positive, concerning divergences are emerging on the 1-hour chart, including an overbought RSI and waning MACD momentum. The market is at a clear inflection point; a decisive break above or rejection from $3000 will dictate the next significant move.\r \r  Details\r \r (1) Daily\r Price Action: A large bullish candle formed a near-perfect recovery of the prior crash. The key caveat is that volume was lower than during the preceding bearish candle, suggesting a potential lack of conviction behind the move.\r Key Levels: Price has returned to the range between the EMA9 and EMA21, with the next major test being the EMA21 itself. The overarching battle remains at the $3000 psychological and technical level.\r \r \r  (2) 4H\r Pattern Recognition: The price action formed a clear ‘U-shaped’ recovery, sharply retracing the entire drop. This indicates intense, compressed buying pressure.\r Current State: The rally has paused at the $3000 resistance.

It delivers improvements in three major areas:\n\n• Lower data availability (DA) costs\nMore efficient blob compression and posting → significantly cheaper costs for L2 data settlement.\n\n• Enhanced Account Abstraction (AA) capabilities\nOptimizations around ERC‑4337, bundlers, and paymasters → reduces friction for new users and simplifies smart account operations.\n\n• Higher network throughput and L2 resilience\nBetter handling of peak activity across rollups → more stability for applications with high-frequency interactions.\n\nQuick Primer: What Is UXLINK’s RWS Protocol?\nUXLINK’s RWS (Real World Social) protocol is a social infrastructure layer that:\n\n- Maps real-world acquaintance networks onto the blockchain\n- Uses trust proofs (e.g., “common acquaintance proofs”)\n- Enables on-chain social verification without exposing personal data\n- Supports tasks, groups, invitations, and identity-linked interactions\n- Powers UXLINK’s 50M+ global user base\n\nRWS requires low-cost, high-frequency blockchain interactions — exactly the kind of environment Fusaka enhances.\n\n1. Improved Account Abstraction → Frictionless User Onboarding\nFusaka strengthens AA and ERC‑4337 flows, enabling:\n\n- Gasless onboarding\n- Fewer pop-up signatures\n- Simplified smart account operations for newcomers\n\nWhy this matters for UXLINK\nRWS interactions — adding connections, joining groups, completing tasks — become smoother and more intuitive.\n\nBenefits include:\n- Lower friction for Web2 → Web3 migration\n- More scalable community campaigns\n- Lower Paymaster costs for UXLINK‑sponsored gas\n\nThis is a major boost for onboarding users across Asia、MENA、LATAM，etc.\n\n2. Lower Data Availability Costs → Cheaper RWS Social Proofs\nFusaka reduces L2 DA posting costs by a large margin.\n\nFor UXLINK, this means:\n- Cheaper on-chain social proofs for trust verification\n- Ability to store more RWS data on-chain\n- Higher transparency and credibility for social verification\n\nExample:\nPosting thousands of RWS trust proofs (e.g., group interactions, connection attestations) becomes more affordable, enabling more robust on-chain social networks.\n\n3. Higher Network Throughput → Stable Large‑Scale Social Activity\nFusaka increases Ethereum’s execution stability under high load.\n\nImpact on UXLINK\nMassive community events and quests run more smoothly\nLower risk of congestion during peak-hour social interactions\nStronger foundation for future value flows such as:\n\n- RWA distribution\n- Stablecoin rewards\n- Fujipay batch payments\n- Fujicard on-chain to off-chain spending\n\nAs UXLINK integrates USDT and other compliant stablecoins, throughput and reliability become even more critical.\n\nWhat This Means for Users and Builders\n\nFor Users\n- Faster interactions\n- No need to hold ETH for basic actions\n- More seamless RWS experiences\n\nFor Communities\n- Scalable campaigns\n- Lower cost for engagement activities\n- Higher reliability during major events\n\nFor Developers / Partners\nMore RWS data can be incorporated into your dApps\nEasier integration with UXLINK identity & trust layers\nBetter environment for building RWA, payments, or social-based utilities\n\nFAQ\nQ1: Do UXLINK users need to do anything after Fusaka?\nNo — improvements happen at the protocol/network level, and RWS benefits automatically.\n\nQ2: Will UXLINK move more data on-chain now?\nYes. Lower DA costs mean more RWS social proofs can be safely stored on-chain.\n\nQ3: Does Fusaka impact Fujipay and Fujicard?\nIndirectly — cheaper and more stable transactions strengthen both payment flows and future RWA distribution paths.\n\nConclusion: A Stronger Foundation for UXLINK’s RWS Vision\nFusaka isn’t just an Ethereum upgrade.\nIt reinforces the core infrastructure needed for UXLINK’s long-term roadmap:\n\n- RWS trust proofs become cheaper\n- Onboarding becomes smoother\n- Large-scale, real-world social interactions become more stable\n\nAs Ethereum becomes more efficient, UXLINK is positioned to scale real-world social networks — and the value flows built on top of them — faster than ever.\n#UXLINK #Fusaka #Ethereum","gravity_id":"371575442","id":1351,"createdAt":"2025-12-03T07:10:03.288Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-03T07:20:02.842Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-03T07:05:49.949Z","text_content":"🚨 JUST IN: US spot ETF flows for Dec. 2 show net inflows for $BTC   ($58.5M), SOL ($45.77M), and XRP ($67.74M). $ETH  spot ETFs recorded net outflows of $9.91M. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"371575419","id":1352,"createdAt":"2025-12-03T07:10:03.368Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-03T07:20:02.906Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-03T07:03:15.766Z","text_content":"$ETH   follow our channel at @supepetoken  Introducing SUPEPE: The Next Big Wave in Crypto, Backed by Elon Musk  The crypto space is abuzz with excitement over the upcoming launch of SUPEPE, a groundbreaking new cryptocurrency set to revolutionize digital finance.

The market structure doesn’t indicate a bearish reversal. Despite traditional allocators rotating into bonds and gold, on-chain liquidity shows crypto-native capital is staying put. \n\nStablecoin supply continues to grow, suggesting that capital is simply parked on-chain, waiting for the right moment to re-enter rather than exiting the ecosystem entirely. This means there’s still potential for a rebound once the market finds its footing🧵\n\n#CoinRank #BTC #ETF\nAs for ETF positions, total holdings have dipped, but net flows have been turning slightly positive since late November. This looks more like early testing behavior from institutions—not a sign of renewed bearish conviction.\n\nIt’s a pattern we’ve seen before during mid-cycle resets: sharp repricing, reduced momentum, and a shift to sideways accumulation. This suggests the structural trend remains intact.\n\nWhat’s missing is a confidence catalyst—and it’s unlikely to come from Bitcoin alone. The real signal will be ETH ETF inflows. A sustained period of strong inflows would signal the market is transitioning from hesitation to commitment, completing the reset. Until then, expect more volatility and consolidation.\nRead more👇\nhttps://www.coinrank.io/market/bitcoin-faces-etf-selling-pressure-but-its-not-a-bear-market/","gravity_id":"371575696","id":1401,"createdAt":"2025-12-03T07:40:02.008Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-03T07:50:02.599Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-03T07:31:45.119Z","text_content":"Vanguard’s diving into third-party crypto ETFs! 🚀 \n\nFinally, a safe haven for $BTC and $ETH fans! \n\nLet’s break the meme barrier! 😂 \n\nMore info here 👉 https://defiliban.com/p/vanguard-third-party-crypto-etfs-2.webm \n\n#Crypto #Investing #Vanguard #ETFs #Bitcoin #Ethereum ","gravity_id":"371575694","id":1402,"createdAt":"2025-12-03T07:40:02.079Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-03T07:50:02.689Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-03T07:44:57.549Z","text_content":"BREAKING: 🇺🇸 Tom Lee's BitMine just bought 30,278 $ETH  worth $91.96 million.\r \r Smart money keeps loading up. #ETHReserve  #Bitmine  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"371575870","id":1420,"createdAt":"2025-12-03T07:50:02.280Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-03T08:20:03.198Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-03T07:43:45.089Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nA whale that went long over 30 times after the November 10th has lost over $6 million, and today opened a new $ETH long position.\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"371575839","id":1422,"createdAt":"2025-12-03T07:50:02.359Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-03T08:10:03.079Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-03T07:43:45.078Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\n$ETH Price Prediction: Targeting $3,400-$3,850 by Mid-December 2025 Amid Bullish Momentum Recovery\n\nETH price prediction points to $3,400-$3,850 target within 2 weeks as technical indicators show emerging bullish momentum despite trading below key moving averages.\n\n…","gravity_id":"371575836","id":1423,"createdAt":"2025-12-03T07:50:02.453Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-03T08:00:03.472Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-03T07:57:48.874Z","text_content":"How do you do your own research in crypto?

After a volatile month for $ETH  , the co-founder outlined a refined roadmap focused on selective efficiency rather than uniform blockspace expansion.  ⚙️ Vitalik’s Proposal: “More Growth, but Not Everywhere”  Buterin suggests Ethereum could see: • 5× higher gas limit, • alongside higher gas costs for operations that create execution-layer inefficiency.  Functions that may become more expensive include: SSTORE when writing new storage, certain complex arithmetic opcodes, calls to contracts with large code size, and slight calldata adjustments. The network already doubled its block gas limit to 60M this year, and Buterin argues future gains must be surgical.  🏦 Tokenized Assets Reinforce ETH’s Market Floor  Market research shows tokenized assets - especially stablecoins - continue to anchor Ethereum’s downside during volatility. Analysts say ETH’s market cap increasingly mirrors the strength of assets issued on-chain, shifting the narrative from speculation to utility.  📈 ETH Rebounds as Macro Sentiment Improves  $ETH   gained 7.46% in the last 24 hours, partially reversing a steep 30-day decline. Supporting factors: • Renewed expectations of Fed rate cuts, • Broad crypto rebound, • ~$22M in whale accumulation reducing sell pressure, • ETH reclaiming key moving averages.  Traders now focus on two critical levels: • $3,000 - short-term stability zone, • $3,800–$4,200 - the range that could reopen a path toward $5,000 if momentum extends.  🔍 Outlook  Ethereum’s next phase won’t be defined by raw blockspace increases - but by precision scaling and the growing influence of tokenized value on the network. Vitalik’s message: growth continues, but smarter, not louder. #Altcoin Season#  #ETH  #Ethereum  #Buterin","gravity_id":"371589151","id":2209,"createdAt":"2025-12-03T15:20:02.558Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-03T15:20:02.558Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-03T15:09:15.723Z","text_content":"First positive weekly close after 4 consecutive negatives.\n\n\nHigher for $ETH","gravity_id":"371588296","id":2210,"createdAt":"2025-12-03T15:20:02.632Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-03T15:20:02.632Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-03T15:27:50.273Z","text_content":"#ETH Analysis\nCMP: $3070\nSupport: $3000\nResistance: $3200 (MA 200)\nETH got rejected from $3140, shorts closing as profit taking comes due to an extensive downtrend.
