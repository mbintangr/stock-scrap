Because of this big upgrade + more people using Ethereum + money flowing in from big investors (ETFs), I think by the end of 2025, 1 $ETH  will be worth between $4,500 and $5,500. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"371602105","id":3074,"createdAt":"2025-12-03T23:40:02.778Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-04T00:10:03.291Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-03T23:34:01.167Z","text_content":"Last time we got a major update, Pectra in May, price ripped about 58% in the weeks after.

This indicates indecision after a strong move, occurring just below the next key hurdle at the EMA50 ($3256).\r Key Development: The break above the previous rally high ($3099) is a positive technical development, shifting market structure.\r Momentum: The Daily MACD continues its bullish expansion below the zero line with sequentially increasing histograms, supporting the recovery thesis.\r \r \r  (2) 4H\r Price Action: A sequence of five bullish candles propelled the price to a high of $3218, nearly testing the 4H EMA200 ($3219).

However, the 4H RSI is in overbought territory at 72, signaling the move is extended.\r Key Level: The $3220 area (EMA200) represents the most immediate and significant resistance.

This isn't just a daily wobble—it's the whole macro picture.\nThe $2,800-$3,000 \"Zone of Destiny\"\nLook at that big, gray shaded box on the chart. That's the $2,800 to $3,000 area.\n• This zone is historic. Every time ETH has been here, it has been a fight. It's acted as both a floor (support) that stopped crashes and a ceiling (resistance) that stopped rallies. It's a key pivot point for the entire market cycle.\n• Where are we right now? We are literally testing the bottom edge of that major zone. The chart shows the price sitting right around $2,900-ish (the current live price is actually closer to $3,200 right now, which is a good sign that the chart's support is holding!).\nThe Big Idea: The \"W\" Pattern\nThis whole massive structure that looks like a giant \"W\" is a classic technical pattern. It suggests two possibilities:\n1. THE BULL CASE (The Launchpad ): If we hold this gray zone and bounce strongly (which the live price is suggesting is already happening!), it validates the entire \"W\" pattern. This pattern implies that the market has finally found its long-term footing. The projected target on this chart is absolutely massive—up towards $5,900! That would be a huge run and confirm a new leg of the bull market.\n2. THE BEAR CASE (The Cliff ): If the price breaks down decisively below $2,800—I'm talking about closing and staying below it—then this beautiful pattern is ruined. It tells us the selling pressure is too strong, and we would likely be heading back toward the previous deep low, which is around the $1,475 mark.","gravity_id":"371608499","id":3578,"createdAt":"2025-12-04T05:40:03.237Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-04T05:50:03.455Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-04T05:37:35.928Z","text_content":"$ETH   will FUSAKA let it go more green","gravity_id":"371608488","id":3579,"createdAt":"2025-12-04T05:40:03.288Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-04T05:50:03.544Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-04T05:33:29.448Z","text_content":"BREAKING: Tom Lee’s #BitMine  just added $150M of $ETH  to its stack.

Now, every L2 blob has a minimum cost that is burned. More L2 adoption = more ETH burned = ETH becomes structurally scarcer.\r \r ✅ 3. The Return to Deflation\r Pre-Fusaka: ~620k ETH issued vs. ~350k burned = inflation.\r Post-Fusaka: L2 burn adds 200k–400k+ ETH/year.\r → Combined burn could reach 600k–1.2M ETH/year, flipping ETH back to deflationary.\r \r ✅ 4. PeerDAS Fuels the Flywheel\r By reducing data bandwidth by 85%, L2s can publish more blobs cheaply → more transactions, more fees, more ETH burned. Growth directly drives scarcity.\r \r ✅ 5. Mainnet Gets a Boost Too\r Block gas limit increases from 36M → 60M = more transactions per block = higher base fee burn on L1.\r \r ✅ 6. Lower Fees → More Activity → More Burn\r Cheaper swaps, bridges, gaming, and social apps on L2s will drive adoption — creating a self-reinforcing cycle of usage and burn.\r \r 🧠Why This Matters:\r Ethereum is no longer just scaling — it’s monetizing its own scaling.\r Pre-Fusaka: L2 growth = less ETH burned.\r Post-Fusaka: L2 growth = more ETH burned.\r \r \r \r \r #Ethereum  #Fusaka  #ETH  $ETH","gravity_id":"371611198","id":3890,"createdAt":"2025-12-04T08:40:02.037Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-04T08:50:08.149Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-04T08:31:35.384Z","text_content":"BREAKING: $125 BILLION IS MIGRATING TO $ETH   ETHEREUM.  UBS. Société Générale. Banque de France.  Three pillars of traditional finance just made their move: They’re porting repo markets, the engine of global liquidity on-chain via Ethereum.  Not tests. Not whitepapers. Real collateral. Real settlement. Real capital.  - Global repo market = $12.5 trillion - Just 1% = $125B - Deployment has begun.  This isn’t DeFi vs TradFi. This is TradFi uploading itself to Ethereum.  In 2019, they mocked smart contracts. In 2020, they ignored DeFi. In 2025, they’re rewriting global finance on open rails.  So here’s the question no one dares to ask:  What happens when Ethereum doesn’t just integrate with the system… but becomes the system itself?

Now, a catalyst with real structural impact has arrived: the Fusaka upgrade is officially live on mainnet, and the timing aligns with a sharp resurgence in accumulation behavior.  Why Fusaka Matters ⚙️  Fusaka isn’t a headline upgrade, but it delivers two high-impact improvements at a moment when Ethereum’s fundamentals are tightening:  More efficient state management → smoother transactions during high-demand periods. Better rollup + L2 support → increased developer throughput, contract deployment, and address growth.  This reduces friction across the network - exactly the type of improvement whales historically accumulate ahead of.  450,000 $ETH  Added by Shark Wallets 🦈  Between Nov 18 – Dec 2, wallets holding 1,000–10,000 ETH accumulated ~450K ETH, reversing the 1.3M ETH they dumped from Oct 5–10. This group often front-runs mid-term trend shifts, signaling renewed confidence as we approach 2025.  Conclusion  Improving network efficiency, accelerating activity, and 450K ETH in fresh accumulation are forming a coordinated setup for upward continuation. With resistance levels tightening, ETH may soon have the structural support to challenge - and potentially reclaim - the $3,500 zone. 🚀  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"371613981","id":4144,"createdAt":"2025-12-04T10:50:02.978Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-04T10:50:02.978Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-04T10:43:07.704Z","text_content":"If the market continues bullish, $ETH  will hit a new ATH.

Sensitive reasoning and tool selection run locally, while heavier, non-sensitive compute can be delegated.\n\nKeys, prompts and trading context remain under local control.\n\"You never want to get public cloud models to be as good as doing your strategy as you are,\" Axelar co-founder @sergey_nog said in an interview with @CoinDesk, which covered the AgentFlux launch (https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/12/04/axelar-unveils-agentflux-to-bring-ai-agents-onchain-without-cloud-risks).\nThe framework was incubated at @interop_labs, developers of Axelar, with collaborators from @UW. It is being released as open-source software for developers and institutional teams.\nA demo app shows the model executing an end-to-end onchain trading workflow using a Coinbase tool-calling environment on Ethereum.

Whether swapping or redeeming, stETH holders typically receive stronger execution than alternatives thanks to its deeper liquidity and larger validator base.\n\nEconomies of Scale:\n\nCurrently, Lido takes a 10% commission on customers' ETH staking rewards, a lower fee than any other blue-chip staking provider.\n\nAlthough Lido has never reduced commissions as part of a low-cost strategy, a top staking provider could readily pull in more stakers by cutting fees, underpricing rivals while boosting profits as users chase superior rewards.\n\nClear examples of this dynamic exist in TradFi, where Vanguard cemented its pioneering reputation in the 1980s by introducing low-cost passive indexing. Those products offered better returns than the high-fee active strategies that prevailed then. Today the asset-management landscape is ruled by low-cost passive indexers, with an unmistakable link between lower fees and larger assets under management.\n\nWho Wins?\n\nWhile Lido is the current standout Ethereum staking provider, as an increasing number of staked ETH ETFs come to market, it is possible the current order is upended.\n\nCoinbase is still well behind the leading ETH staking providers, controlling just one quarter of Lido's share at 6.3% of total ETH staked, but it remains the clear heavyweight in institutional crypto custody. As of June, Coinbase custodied 81% of all U.S. ETF crypto asset holdings.\n\nAlthough it might be logical to assume that Lido will simply expand its staking dominance with ETF managers incentivized to use Lido for its liquidity advantages and economies of scale, Coinbase is arguably better positioned to capture these flows.\n\nIn traditional finance, relationships matter. ETF managers need a custodial staking partner with a name and face they can trust to withstand regulatory scrutiny, provide audited assurances, and (in a worst case scenario) be summoned to court.\n\nCoinbase spent years cultivating relationships across Wall Street, and successfully embedded itself as the default crypto custodian for institutions in the process. So when those same institutions look for a staking partner, Coinbase may be the natural first call.\n\nConcentration Dangers\n\nIf BlackRock, which manages the largest ETH ETF, were to stake its ETH through Coinbase, a firm in which BlackRock's products hold 7% ownership, the exchange could quickly overtake Lido as the dominant ETH staking provider.\n\nWhen Coinbase staking products receive inflows from ETFs, the amount of liquidity available for redemptions naturally increases. Additionally, Coinbase can solidify its control over staking markets by dropping staking commissions, providing a financial incentive for even more stakers to make the switch.\n\nIn Ethereum and many other Proof of Stake blockchains, there are three critical staking dominance thresholds. As a staking group crosses each one, it gains greater influence over the chain and access to higher staking rewards. In turn, these higher yields help to reinforce the leader's position, discouraging delegation elsewhere and accelerating centralization.\n\nThese systemic centralization risks will exist regardless of which operator becomes dominant, but if Coinbase surpassed these thresholds, the outcome would be especially stark, effectively handing total authority over a blockchain designed for decentralization to a centralized corporation accountable only to its shareholders.","gravity_id":"371624020","id":4586,"createdAt":"2025-12-04T14:40:03.064Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-04T14:40:03.064Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-04T14:47:47.933Z","text_content":"$ETH Big rewards.
