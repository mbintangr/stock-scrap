Volume is slowing down too, which usually means the market is waiting for a direction. Moves like this remind me why I stopped relying only on manual trading.   Grid Trading on BingX helps me catch those buy low, sell high swings automatically, while Copy Trading lets me learn how pros react in moments like this.   Both have helped me stay steady. Beginners should try both to see which one fits their style best.  ﻿#BingXSpot  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#  #CMC Launch: Aster#","gravity_id":"371680055","id":7366,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T02:00:02.287Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T03:20:03.426Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-06T02:00:21.216Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $ETH","gravity_id":"371680112","id":7379,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T02:10:02.572Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T03:30:03.758Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-06T02:14:26.763Z","text_content":"💥BREAKING:\r \r BLACKROCK DEPOSITS 1,384.7 $BTC  ($120.3 MILLION) AND 799 $ETH  ($2.5 MILLION) TO COINBASE.","gravity_id":"371679284","id":7388,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T02:20:01.993Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T03:50:03.486Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-06T02:13:14.219Z","text_content":"$ETH  now below $3 ,000.","gravity_id":"371679279","id":7389,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T02:20:02.103Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T03:50:03.640Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-06T02:43:45.048Z","text_content":"I just placed an $ETH pair to Gollum's Precious Things on $ZORA.\n\nNow anyone can trade outside the app.\n\nThis is in appreciate to everyone getting the project over $40,000 MC.

A bearish daily candle on lower volume erased the prior day’s gains, signaling a failure of follow-through buying. Momentum has turned negative on lower timeframes, with price breaking below $3100 and now testing a crucial support cluster between $2978 and $3033. The market posture has shifted back to cautious and bearish-leaning.\r \r  Details\r \r Daily\r Price Action: The daily chart printed the first bearish candle following three consecutive bullish days, effectively negating the prior session's advance. Critically, this occurred on lower volume, indicating a lack of selling panic but also a definitive absence of buyers.\r Key Levels: Price has fallen back below $3100 and is testing the EMA9. The next major support zone is identified between $2978 and $3033.\r Momentum: MACD, while still bullish, shows a significant loss of momentum. Its histogram has declined for the first time in the recent sequence, and the lines have marginally converged.\r \r \r  4H\r Price Action: A high-volume sell-off drove price down to a low of $2982. The subsequent bounce has been weak and is now testing the EMA50 (~$3036).\r Trend Structure: The EMA9 is converging with the EMA21, threatening a bearish death cross that would solidify the short-term downtrend.\r Momentum: MACD lines are bearish and diverging, with the fast line now below zero. The rising red histogram confirms increasing downward momentum.\r \r  1H\r Price Action: After the sharp decline to $2982, the bounce has been characterized by severely diminished volume and low volatility.\r Structure: Bearish death crosses are in place (EMA21 under EMA50, EMA9 under EMA200), confirming the shift to a downtrend on this timeframe.\r Momentum: MACD has formed a bullish cross, but its extremely weak character—small line separation and muted histogram growth—perfectly mirrors the anemic and unconvincing price action of the bounce.","gravity_id":"371682359","id":7588,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T05:50:02.481Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T06:10:02.987Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-06T05:46:45.112Z","text_content":"Ethereum Activates Fusaka as First Automated BPO Fork Set for Dec 9 \n-   https://coinfomania.com/ethereum-activates-fusaka-as-first-automated-bpo-fork-set-for-dec-9/ ","gravity_id":"371681440","id":7589,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T05:50:02.592Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T06:10:03.111Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-06T05:46:31.085Z","text_content":"#ETH Analysis\nCMP: $3035\nSupport: $3024\nResistance: $3155\nETH is relatively weak in comparison to BTC red candles have increasing volumes which shows that the bears have clear control over the price.\n $ETH","gravity_id":"371682344","id":7590,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T05:50:02.715Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T06:00:03.695Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-06T05:45:28.299Z","text_content":"Metaplanet just took another $50M loan to buy more Bitcoin While you're asking if you should buy $100 worth, they're going all-in with borrowed money Conviction hits different when you have conviction 🔥 $BTC  $ETH  👉 Trade like institutions wtih Finora AI: tinyurl.com/FinoraBot","gravity_id":"371681436","id":7591,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T05:50:02.790Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T06:00:03.810Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-06T05:45:14.469Z","text_content":"Crypto Market Dominance Update 🚀\r \r 🟧 Bitcoin $BTC : ~58.83%\r \r 🟣 Ethereum $ETH : ~11.50%\r \r #Bitcoin  #Ethereum  #BTC  #ETH","gravity_id":"371682337","id":7592,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T05:50:02.858Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T06:00:03.923Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-06T05:43:44.424Z","text_content":"$ETH  almost 2R up, booking tp1 here  Have a good weekend❤️","gravity_id":"371682325","id":7593,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T05:50:02.932Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T06:00:04.047Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-06T05:41:19.090Z","text_content":"🐋 INSIGHT: BTC holds steady near $90K as whales quietly load up on discounted ETH. #crypto  $BTC  $ETH","gravity_id":"371681406","id":7594,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T05:50:03.085Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T06:00:04.128Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-06T05:52:55.998Z","text_content":"BlackRock CEO: Sovereign wealth funds buying BTC at $80K Retail: \"I'll wait for $60K\" | Countries are buying your \"dip\" You're waiting for a better one.

Ethereum is back in the spotlight: after updating its local maximum in the $3,210 area, the price rolled back to the $3,000 zone, where the asset found short-term support. The 4H chart clearly shows that the market is moving in a wide sideways range: the compression of volatility and the alternation of red and green candles hint at an accumulation phase. $ETH  still maintains an upward structure when viewed from the local bottom of $2,720.  Over the past day, the asset has lost about 3%, but it is holding an important psychological level. For the week, the price remains above previous lows, which indicates restrained buyer interest. Key levels: support at $2,980–3,000, resistance at $3,180–3,230. A breakout above resistance could accelerate the move towards $3,350, while a drop below $2,970 would open the way for a retest of $2,850. The probability of a continuation of the sideways movement is about 55%, an upward breakout is 30%, and a downward breakout is 15%.  From a fundamental point of view, the Ethereum network remains the foundation of Web3 and DeFi, but active user interest is gradually spreading across several ecosystems. Against this backdrop, demand for cheaper transactions and high throughput is increasing attention to TON and its DeFi segment.  💠 STONfi and the trend of interoperability in DeFi One of the most promising areas today is the cross-chain approach. STONfi, a DEX on TON, takes advantage of the network's high speed, minimal fees, and native smart contracts. The convenience of exchange and simple protocol architecture allow users to conduct transactions without unnecessary steps, and on-chain transparency confirms the correctness of operations.
