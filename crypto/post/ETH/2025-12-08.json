Now consolidating around 90k in a high-volatility range.\n ・In the last two rate-cut events (Sep 17 and Oct 29), BTC first bounced right after the announcement, then trended down for weeks. For this FOMC as well, it’s critical to separate “the first reaction” from “what happens in the following weeks.”\n ・For five straight weeks, crypto sentiment has been stuck in “Fear.” It’s not just prices—this psychological chill is showing up in reduced positioning and weaker spot volumes.\n ・Binance Proof of Reserves shows BTC balances up by +23,768 BTC, while ETH and USDT are down. Capital is rotating out of stables and ETH and into BTC directly – a classic bull-market style flow.\n ・ETH, however, leads all assets in net inflows over the past month at roughly $4.7B. Even though price is still around the low 3Ks, flow data alone would suggest “ETH as the next main character.”\n ・Global BTC treasuries held by governments, corporations, and funds have now surpassed 4 million BTC. BTC is steadily shifting from a “retail speculation asset” into a “strategic asset for states and institutions.”\n ・In Korea, regulators are moving to impose “bank-level, no-fault liability” on exchanges after the Upbit hack—requiring user compensation regardless of fault. User protection is entering a new phase in Asia as well.\n ・In the EU, one year after MiCA took effect, euro-pegged stablecoins have doubled in market cap and now see $3.83B in monthly volume. Clear rules have actually accelerated market growth—a textbook case of regulation as a growth enabler.\nーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー\nOn-chain & Technical Trends\n ・Only 8.7% of all ETH now sits on centralized exchanges, the lowest share since Ethereum launched in 2015. With CEX balances at 10-year lows, supply is extremely thin and any demand comeback could spark a sharp squeeze higher.\n ・ETH has been quietly stacking up via net inflows and treasury accumulation, while the Fusaka upgrade pushed new contract deployments to an all-time high, 28% above the previous peak. Mid-term fundamentals are clearly bullish.\n ・BTC’s SOPR ratio (LTH/STH) has dropped to 1.35, the lowest level this year. The 12.6k → 80k-range drawdown has largely flushed out heavy long-term profit-taking and distribution.\n ・Bitcoin Archive notes that the hash ribbon has flipped bearish while short-term holder (STH) NUPL has turned negative. Historically, this “miners + STH capitulating at the same time” pattern often appears near macro bottom zones.\n ・Realized price across almost all long-term UTXO age bands has been rising since mid-October. This means LTHs are taking profits on some cheap coins while the cost basis of what they keep is trending higher—a healthy form of capital rotation.\n ・On the derivatives side, BTC sits near 90k, but Binance futures Z-score has dropped to −1.48, signaling volumes well below the monthly average. It’s an up-move with weak momentum and shrinking leverage.\n ・At the same time, the position map shows that a move to 93k could liquidate about $1B in shorts, and a spike to 100k could nuke roughly $9.1B. The “short squeeze trigger” is heavily primed.\n ・Spot volumes across major exchanges (Binance, Bybit, OKX, etc.) have decelerated into November, while futures still account for ~75% of total market volume. Binance’s spot/futures ratio has fallen to 0.23. Price discovery is now almost entirely derivatives-driven.\nーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー\nSentiment\n ・Fear & Greed has stayed in “Fear” territory for five weeks. With repeated liquidation waves and ongoing rumors of fund blowups, many now say “this 126k → 80k correction is not a normal dip.”\n ・Within just four hours over the weekend, $171M in longs and $75M in shorts were wiped out—a textbook “thin liquidity + leverage hunt” move. In this kind of market, the real edge is not trying to fight back with leverage at all.\n ・Coin Bureau suggests 2025 may be a “sideways year” rather than a crash year, with any major downside more likely pushed into 2026. The idea is that the market is taking its time to construct the next cycle, in a kind of “boring bull” mode.\n ・Tom Lee has floated a long-term ETH target around $62,000. Many analysts also note that ETH has not yet experienced a true “global liquidity blow-off top” this cycle. From a cycle perspective, the real mania may still be ahead.\n ・Search interest for “dollar debasement” has hit an all-time high, just as BTC and gold both tagged fresh ATHs. The “dollar debasement trade” is clearly moving from theory into behavior, with capital shifting into value-preserving assets.\n ・Regional flow data shows the current BTC market is “U.S.-only” on the buy side: the U.S. remains net long, while Europe and Asia have flipped to net selling. This U.S.-centric structure is supportive but also fragile from a sentiment standpoint.\n ・In TradFi, Netflix’s potential $83B acquisition of Warner Bros and a surge in bankruptcies in non-AI sectors show that the old economy is in an intense shake-out, even as AI stocks and select crypto names rip higher. The risk-on structure is highly uneven.\n ・Vanguard, once one of the loudest BTC skeptics, now offers Bitcoin ETFs on its own platform. When even the harshest critics adopt, it becomes harder to construct a truly bearish long-term argument.\nーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー\nU.S. Traditional Markets\n ・This week is a “super week” for markets: JOLTS, the FOMC rate cut decision, Powell’s press conference, and jobless claims—all in a few days. The cut itself is mostly priced in; what matters is not “what they do” but “how Powell talks about it.”\n ・According to The Kobeissi Letter, the Fed’s balance sheet shrinkage during QT (3 years and 5 months) has totaled $2.43T, unwinding 51% of the pandemic-era QE expansion. As of December 1, QT officially ended, opening the door to potential liquidity expansion ahead.\n ・Bank of America sees a high probability that the Fed announces “Reserve Management Purchases” at this FOMC—effectively a light version of QE aimed at boosting bank reserves and easing funding stress. That would be a structurally bullish signal for risk assets.\n ・On the flip side, 717 large U.S. companies have gone bankrupt this year, the highest in 15 years. Many of these failures are in areas not benefiting from AI, highlighting the “invisible pain” spreading beneath the surface of headline indices.\n ・The U.S. Treasury Secretary is guiding to 3% GDP growth for 2025—a notably optimistic projection. Meanwhile JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon openly criticizes Europe for driving out business, investment, and innovation. Capital flows between regions are becoming more polarized.\n ・Japan’s 30-year JGB yield is spiking, but the VIX remains calm. There’s no obvious sign yet of a violent carry-trade unwind or yen spike, but this combination is a “quiet warning” that something may be starting to move.\n ・China has added gold for 13 consecutive months, buying another 30k troy ounces in November and taking holdings to 74.12M ounces. Many countries are rebalancing their reserves away from the dollar and into value-preserving assets like gold and BTC.\n ・CZ has called on governments to record all public spending on blockchains as an incorruptible public ledger. At the same time, U.S. regulators are discussing both “full market on-chain infrastructure” and potential sovereign BTC accumulation. The financial infrastructure itself is starting to shift.\nーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー\nOverall Assessment\nIn the short term, the market remains in a high-volatility environment driven by thin liquidity and leverage hunts, routinely flushing out both long and short positions. At the same time, ETH’s historic exchange outflows, Fusaka-driven on-chain activity, the end of Fed QT with talk of reserve purchases, 4M BTC held in treasuries, and full adoption of BTC ETFs by giants like Vanguard all point to a strengthening mid- to long-term fundamental and supply-demand backdrop.\nToday’s XWIN TREND INDEX is 68 / 100, with a directional bias of “Mild uptrend.”\nLooking one month ahead, this week’s FOMC and Powell’s remarks could be a turning point for the key trio of “rates, dollar, and liquidity.” In the last two rate-cut events, the pattern was “short-term bounce, then weeks of downside,” so once again the priority should be preparation, not prediction. The base case strategy is: keep leverage minimal, accumulate spot BTC, ETH, and select L1s in steps, and watch ETH flows, BTC ETF flows, and U.S. capital movements—as well as post-FOMC volatility—for opportunities on both pullbacks and short-covering rallies.

Despite a sharp intraday rally attempt, the price action confirms a lack of sustained buying interest, resulting in immediate rejection and a full retracement. The weekly MACD crossing below its zero line is a significant development, reinforcing the primary downtrend. Until this macro structure is challenged, short-term rallies within the downtrend should be viewed with skepticism.\r \r  Weekly:\r The weekly chart is decisively bearish: a doji at $3000, with the MACD fast line now BELOW zero – a critical confirmation of macro bearish momentum.\r \r  Daily\r Price Action: The daily candle is a doji with a pronounced lower shadow and minimal upper shadow, closing below the EMA9 (~$3041). This pattern indicates buyers defended a lower level intraday but lacked strength to hold gains, resulting in a close near the lows and below immediate resistance.\r Key Levels: Immediate resistance is the failed EMA21 (~$3150). The EMA9 at ~$3041 now acts as nearby resistance. Support is at the daily low and the $3000 zone.\r Momentum: The daily MACD lines are still parallel and above zero, but the histogram has begun a sequential decline, providing clear evidence that upward momentum is waning. This aligns with the price rejection at the EMA21.\r \r  1H\r Price Action Pattern: The session exhibited a classic false breakout or “bull trap” pattern:\r Breakdown below a consolidation range.\r A sharp, impulsive rally that breaks above the prior range high ($3150).\r An immediate and equally sharp reversal that erases the entire rally, leaving the price back at the top of the prior range.\r This creates a distinct “spike” or “mountain top” shape on the chart, representing a victory for sellers over eager breakout buyers.","gravity_id":"371732150","id":11286,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T00:40:02.235Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T01:20:03.579Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-08T00:49:35.498Z","text_content":"$ETH crypto sucks","gravity_id":"371731321","id":11299,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T00:50:02.631Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T01:40:03.690Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-08T01:06:59.969Z","text_content":"$ETHis moyny plis etc","gravity_id":"371732316","id":11314,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T01:10:02.376Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T02:10:03.803Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-08T01:02:41.590Z","text_content":"$ETH   follow our channel at @supepetoken  Introducing **SUPEPE**, the revolutionary Level 2 meme coin designed for unstoppable growth and massive community rewards!

Under this idea, users and platforms could “buy gas forward” at a fixed price for a specific time window - similar to traditional futures contracts.  This would become a powerful tool for traders, dApps, and large service providers that need predictable operational costs.  Even though Ethereum fees have decreased recently, they remain volatile. Buterin argues that a transparent market for gas expectations would help the ecosystem plan ahead, reduce uncertainty for users, and improve overall network efficiency.  #Altcoin Season#  #ETHBlockchain  #ETH","gravity_id":"371738214","id":11951,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T08:30:03.132Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T08:30:03.132Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-08T08:38:25.788Z","text_content":"[{\"sourceId\":\"69368dec6736e9074d364ceb\",\"tldr\":\"Vitalik Buterin suggests an on-chain futures market to stabilize Ethereum's gas price unpredictability long-term.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/6935513f5ab885292b798c35\",\"relevantWord\":\"on-chain futures market\",\"score\":\"8.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"69368df06736e9074d364cf8\",\"tldr\":\"Ethereum exchange balances hit decade lows, indicating investors' shift towards long-term holding and confidence in ETH stability.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/post/371712898\",\"relevantWord\":\"exchange balances hit decade lows\",\"score\":\"8.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"69368dd66736e9074d364cd9\",\"tldr\":\"UK law now recognizes Ethereum as personal property, facilitating crypto use in English-law financial structures.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/6935c54551525f6776825d1d\",\"relevantWord\":\"UK law recognizes Ethereum\",\"score\":\"8.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"69368dd56736e9074d364cd7\",\"tldr\":\"Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake enhances scalability and attracts institutional investors, bolstering its ecosystem for real-world applications.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/6935b863f951506606c1466a\",\"relevantWord\":\"Proof-of-Stake enhances scalability\",\"score\":\"8.0\"}]","gravity_id":"371738416","id":11969,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T08:40:02.451Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T09:00:07.796Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-08T08:37:45.113Z","text_content":"#eth \n\nETH is about to explode.

He cites multiple bullish catalysts for $ETH , including the Fusaka (Fulu-Osaka) upgrade boosting scalability and security, plus a supportive macro backdrop with the Fed ending QT and likely rate cuts coming.  According to Lee, the market is now over 8 weeks past the October 10th liquidation shock — meaning crypto can finally trade on forward fundamentals again.
