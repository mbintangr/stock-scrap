Data moats. Capital efficiency. Distribution channels. Brand recognition.\n\nThese compound over time, creating overwhelming competitive advantage. \nSmall trustless startups face insurmountable structural disadvantages.\nThe centralized players are already here: \n\n🔹 Coinbase offers \"open source\" protocols while maintaining centralized control \n🔹JP Morgan and Visa build on Ethereum with extractive business models \n🔹Virtuals ACP positions as decentralized but remains centrally controlled \nEthereum has achieved trustlessness at the protocol level.\n\nBut without EF actively supporting the smaller trustless actors who embody Ethereum's values, those who merely use Ethereum will dominate.\n\nWhat's the point if it becomes the foundation for centralized power? \nTo fight for trustlessness means giving active preference to trustless projects to compensate for overwhelming structural advantages.\n\nEF can pursue big partnerships but must also preferentially support decentralized, trustless infrastructure.\nWithout Ethereum Foundation tilting the playing field toward decentralized ecosystem players, the centralized minority wins simply by being more coordinated than the fragmented trustless majority.\n\nEthereum becomes the settlement layer for blockchain-enabled centralization.\nThe choice is stark: a decentralized economy where value is shared, or blockchain as the ultimate tool of centralized extraction.\n\nDecentralization offers humanity a defense. \nFor the first time, we can build systems where everyone shares in the value they create.\nEthereum has achieved something remarkable.\n\nNow EF must choose: will it fight for what has been achieved, or watch it become the foundation for centralization?\n\nThis is about ensuring value created by commerce is shared by the many, not captured by the few.\n\n— Justin Banon, Co-founder @BosonProtocol\nRead the full article 👇\n","gravity_id":"371784092","id":15213,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T16:00:05.421Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T16:10:04.676Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-09T15:52:45.070Z","text_content":"⚡ INTERVIEW: Multimillionaire entrepreneur Kevin O'Leary, @kevinolearytv says he has no interest in altcoins, arguing that holding $BTC and $ETH alone captures most of the upside in the crypto market. \n@kevinolearytv Read the full story:\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/magazine/quantum-attacking-bitcoin-would-be-a-waste-of-time-kevin-oleary/","gravity_id":"371782369","id":15214,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T16:00:05.579Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T16:00:05.579Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-09T16:05:02.097Z","text_content":"$1B Security  That’s what $ETH  provides to Tanssi to access via Symbiotic’s restaking.

At this year’s Devconnect, there was a massive Cloudflare outage on Day 2.\n@schmidsi live demoed how ENS, @Filecoin Onchain Cloud, and @safe can be used to create a simple and secure deployment pipeline to publish websites and apps in a decentralized way.\nPerhaps the buzziest topic was payment and identity standards for AI agents on blockchain rails, like ERC-8004 and x402. Agents can act autonomously, but their identity, attribution, and payments need to be onchain. That is exactly where ENS fits.\n\n@schmidsi moderated a packed ERC-8004 panel with MetaMaskAI, Nethermind, Flashbots, and the EF, digging into how agents anchor identity and trust.\nThe L2 space has grown enormously over the last few @EFDevcon events, and it's clearer than ever that we need ENS as a cross-chain identity standard, not tied to a single network.\n\n@gregskril ran a hands-on workshop on L2 primary names for @Arbitrum, @Optimism, @Scroll_ZKP , @LineaBuild, and @Base.\nENS Labs met with @Nethermind after announcing that @Namechain, the upcoming ENS ZK rollup, will run on Nethermind Surge, built on @taikoxyz.\nThe teams aligned on performance, developer experience, and future collaboration around onchain identity. 👀 https://twitter.com/996321865311358976/status/1990509053618106726\nENS is only as powerful as its community of builders.
