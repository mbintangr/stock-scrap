Clear Breakout on the 4H\n\n\nETH pushed strongly through the mid-Bollinger band and almost hit the upper band.

Momentum Turning Up\n\n\nMACD has flipped bullish across multiple timeframes, showing growing buying pressure.\nNo bearish divergence for now — momentum is still with the bulls.\n\n\n⸻\n\n\n📌 4. Volume Confirms the Move\n\n\nThe breakout candle came with a strong volume surge. The retrace has much lower volume, which often means the move wasn’t a fakeout and bulls are simply cooling off.\n\n\n⸻\n\n\n📌 5. Order Flow Favors Upside\n\n\nBid liquidity remains stronger than asks, showing buyers are still active. No heavy sell walls above the current price.\n\n\n⸻\n\n\n📈 Final Outlook\n\n\nETH looks stronger than it has in days.\nIf the 3,235–3,260 support area holds, the next target remains the 3,390–3,410 zone.

Markets are behaving as if the next liquidity phase is already being priced in. Stocks sitting right under all time highs while policy is still restrictive usually indicates preparation for future conditions rather than a reaction to current ones.  If balance sheet expansion begins in early 2026 (QE), even modestly, the environment changes for assets that capture activity and settlement demand. That is where $ETH  benefits. Rollups continue to grow, staking provides a structural sink for liquidity, and institutional access is already established through ETFs and treasuries. New liquidity tends to flow toward assets with both economic usage and credible infrastructure.  Rate cuts may set the tone, but the larger move typically follows when markets believe liquidity will expand for more than one policy meeting. In that scenario, assets tied to real throughput and network value often show the strongest reflexive upside.  My view is that $ETH  remains positioned at the center of that dynamic. It absorbs demand from applications, it benefits from lower discount rates, and it scales into new cycles rather than flattening into them. If liquidity expectations build through 2026, the next leg higher is likely led by Ethereum rather than the peripheral parts of the market.","gravity_id":"371794180","id":16062,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T23:30:02.559Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T00:10:03.167Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-09T23:34:26.049Z","text_content":"FOMC gives us the excuse to squeeze into the yearly open zone around 3.3k you see marked there.

However, this rally exhibits a defining contradiction: strong intraday momentum on lower timeframes contrasts with subdued daily volume. This pattern points to a market driven by short-term positioning ahead of the pivotal Federal Reserve interest rate decision, rather than by sustained institutional capital inflow. The immediate trend's validity hinges entirely on the macro outcome.\r \r  Macro Context: The Dominant Driver\r  The December 10th FOMC decision and press conference is the overwhelming focus for all risk assets, including crypto.\r Market State: the current phase is like a \"period of digestion\" and consolidation, where investor activity has narrowed primarily to BTC and ETH while the broader market awaits \"macro clarity\".\r Implication for ETH: The recent surge from ~3100 to ~3450 is a reflection of shifting rate-cut expectations. A dovish Fed could validate the breakout and target the next resistance zone (3500-3600). A hawkish surprise could trigger a swift reversal, testing the 3200 breakout level as support.\r \r  Technical Picture:  Daily\r The large bullish candle closing above the EMA21 and the 3200 level is a strong positive. The MACD's turn to a \"sequentially increasing\" histogram supports recovering momentum. The lack of surging daily volume, however, is a critical caveat, suggesting a lack of committed long-term bids.\r \r  4H & 1H\r The analysis here is precise. The high-volume surge, the bullish MA alignment (with the notable EMA9/EMA200 golden cross), and the MACD's positive shift all depict powerful short-term buying pressure.

The Nicholas Bitcoin and Treasuries AfterDark ETF would purchase exposure at U.S. market close and exit positions shortly after opening.   The #SEC  filing describes a strategy utilizing Bitcoin futures during overnight hours, closing positions after U.S. markets open each trading day. When using Bitcoin underlying funds, the #ETF  buys securities at close and sells around open, capturing movement during off-hours periods.   Assets would rotate into U.S. Treasuries, money market funds, and cash equivalents during daytime trading. The approach attempts to harvest potential gains while avoiding intraday #volatility  through indirect $BTC  exposure.   ETF analyst Eric Balchunas responded that research shows most Bitcoin gains occur after traditional market hours. He clarified that this does not diminish ETF impact, noting that positioning relates to ETF activity and derivatives based on fund flows.   Balchunas suggested that an after-hours focused product could potentially deliver superior returns by concentrating on overnight price movements. The strategy represents an attempt to isolate a specific pattern in Bitcoin trading behavior.   The Form N-1A registration statement adds two Nicholas Wealth Management products to Tidal Trust II's existing fund lineup. SEC approval is not guaranteed, and the filing remains subject to modification.   Regulators have approved numerous crypto-linked investment vehicles including Bitcoin and $ETH  futures ETFs, spot digital asset ETFs, and staked crypto products. The AfterDark concept introduces a temporal dimension to ETF strategy design.

Here are simple investing tips based on the latest price action:  1️⃣ Avoid chasing pumps — wait for cleaner entries  The move to ~3,397 was fast. Better entries usually appear during consolidation. The 3,280–3,300 zone is key support and offers safer setups than buying into spikes.  2️⃣ Let momentum confirm your decisions  MACD has cooled but hasn’t turned bearish. An upward turn in momentum often signals the next push. Reacting is better than guessing.  3️⃣ Low volume here is normal  ETH is resting after the breakout. Low volume often means the market is preparing for its next move, not reversing.  4️⃣ Watch resistance at 3,350–3,380  A strong move through this range can send ETH back toward 3,397–3,410. A clean breakout would strengthen the bullish case.  5️⃣ Use simple invalidation levels  For short-term traders, a drop below 3,270 weakens the current structure. Clear invalidation points help avoid emotional decisions.  6️⃣ Long-term holders: focus on structure  Higher timeframes still show: • Uptrend intact • RSI healthy • Price holding support These are signs of strength, not weakness.  ⭐ Final Thought  ETH remains stable and constructive. Consolidation after a breakout is normal, and patient entries tend to outperform rushed ones.  Follow for more short-term ETH updates and simple investing insights.

It’s a big step towards making onchain payments feel native to the internet.\nGravity’s story is complementary, but fundamentally different:\n\n“What if you designed a high-performance chain where native oracles and RWA are first-class citizens?”\n\nWe’re building a Reth-powered L1 where: \n- gigagas-scale execution (1+ Ggas/s, sub-second finality) is the norm\n- a native oracle data layer is built directly into the core protocol\n- RWAs, prediction markets, and payment flows can all consume cross-chain data as a native protocol primitive\nOn Gravity, high performance is the implementation detail that brings the RWA + native oracle vision to life: \n\n- gravity-reth: optimized mempool + pipelined execution, with storage and indexing engineered for billions of accounts  \n- grevm: parallel EVM execution built for high-throughput transaction processing  \n- gravity-sdk: end-to-end benchmarks sustaining ~1.9 gigagas per second with sub-second finality across our network   \n\nGravity’s technical capabilities can be adopted by any Reth-based ecosystem, including projects like Tempo.  For onchain RWAs, prediction markets, and oracle-heavy DeFi to work at scale, this is the execution environment they require. See all the open-source repos on GitHub: https://t.co/FIPjvR2FCl\nOn top of execution, we’re integrating a native oracle layer directly into the protocol, not as an add-on integration, but as core infra.  \n\nGravity embeds a validator-secured oracle primitive capable of: \n- ingesting JWKs, DNS-style records, and events/state from other chains (e.g. Ethereum)\n- anchoring this data under Gravity’s PoS consensus\n- providing it to smart contracts as structured, queryable information\n\nThis forms the foundation for RWA asset state and collateralization, prediction markets, and advanced payment logic, powered by fast blocks + fast data.\nThe ecosystem is crystallizing around two complementary pillars:\n\n- Tempo: the payments engine, stablecoin transfers, settlements, merchant flows as the primary product\n- Gravity: the data and asset engine, native oracles and RWAs elevated to first-class primitives, backed by high-performance execution\n\nThe industry has talked about onchain RWAs and oracle-heavy products for years. Now, with Reth, Tempo, and Gravity the infrastructure finally exists to make them real at scale 🌀","gravity_id":"371809611","id":17077,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T12:00:02.658Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T12:10:04.245Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-10T11:57:59.771Z","text_content":"A whale has opened a $38,325,000 $ETH  long position with 7x leverage.

In other words, when we remove Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the other top 8 giants, this chart shows the market share of the remaining \"small and medium-sized\" altcoins (Mid-Caps, Low-Caps, Gems).\nHere is the detailed technical analysis of this chart:\n1. The Big Picture: Historical Cycles and Trend Structure\nThe chart displays a massive formation stretching from 2016 to the present, along with a projection for the future. We see price action compressing between two major trendlines:\n• Ascending Support Line (Black Lower Line):\n• 2016: A historic bottom starting at the 1.5% level. This was the \"infancy\" period of the altcoin market.\n• 2021: A perfect support test at the 5.5% level. This was the harbinger of the 2021 bull run.\n• 2023-2024: The chart shows the dominance approaching this trendline again (around 7%) and attempting to hold. The areas marked with yellow dots are \"accumulation\" zones.\n• Descending Resistance Line (Black Upper Line):\n• 2021 Peak: Dominance hit a historic high of 19.5%. This was the peak of what we call \"Altseason.\"\n• Since then, we see Lower Highs. This indicates that money has been flowing either into Bitcoin or out of the market entirely, crushing smaller altcoins.\n2. Critical Levels and the Language of Numbers\nThe percentages on the graph are vital:\n• 19.5% (The Peak): The point of maximum market euphoria. The moment when small coins saw incredible valuations.\n• 12% (Intermediate Resistance): The 2017-2018 peak and the first major psychological barrier that needs to be broken in the current downtrend.\n• 7% (Current Status/Support): The zone we are currently in. This is a \"moment of decision.\" We are reaching the apex of the squeeze between the historical ascending support and the descending resistance.\n3. Formation Analysis: A Massive \"Wedge\" Compression\nIn technical analysis, we can describe this structure as a \"Symmetrical Triangle\" or, in a broadening perspective, a wedge formation.\n• Compression: Price action is getting tighter. Volatility is decreasing. This is usually the calm before the storm. Energy is building up.\n• Yellow Dots: These points prove how much the market respects this trend. The touches in 2023 and 2024 show that market makers are tracking this line.\n• The Orange Arrow (Projection): The orange arrow on the chart predicts that this compression will result in a sharp upward breakout. If this happens, altcoin dominance could surge from the 7% range back up to the 18-20% band.\n4. What Does This Chart Tell Us?\nTechnically, this chart supports an \"Altseason\" (Altcoin Rally) scenario.\n1. Expectation of Liquidity Rotation: The chart suggests that money will soon (in the 2025-2026 projection) rotate out of Bitcoin and the Top 10, flowing into riskier but higher-reward altcoins.\n2. Fractal Structure: A similar move to the 2016-2017 fractal is expected to occur on a larger scale during the 2024-2025 period. In 2016, the move from 1.5% to 12% created 100x returns for many coins. A move from 7% to 19% now would imply similarly massive multipliers.\n3. The Risk: We are currently hovering just above the 7% support. If this black ascending trendline is broken to the downside (the dotted line scenario on the chart), \"winter\" for altcoins will be harsher and longer. However, looking at the volume bars at the bottom, volume is decreasing during drops, which tells me that sellers are exhausted.\nConclusion and Action Plan\nHere is my summary as Cryptollica:\nThe market is currently coiled like a spring. Altcoins outside the Top 10 are holding onto the historical support trend (7% levels). The orange arrow predicts aggressive upside momentum once the falling trend (the upper black line) is broken.\n• What to Watch: The breakout of the upper descending black trendline.","gravity_id":"371812975","id":17460,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T15:50:06.153Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T15:50:06.153Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-10T15:31:45.044Z","text_content":"30,000 ETH\n\nTransparent and streamlined access to the leading low risk DeFi opportunities on Ethereum\n\nhttp://stake.lido.fi/earn/strategy\n\nPowered by staked ETH ","gravity_id":"371815007","id":17461,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T15:50:06.334Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T15:50:06.334Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-10T15:30:00.142Z","text_content":"🔸After finding support at $2,800, $ETH  price broke through its major resistance at $3,160.
