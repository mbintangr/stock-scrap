The Fed lowered its Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.50% to 3.75%, but its hawkish tone has sparked a decline in crypto prices.  Key Takeaways:  $BTC   briefly rose above $94,000 after the cut but quickly dropped to $90,000.  $ETH   fell 6%, trading at $3,200, while Solana and Dogecoin also dropped by more than 6%.  Analysts believe the Fed's forecast for only one more 25-basis point rate cut next year may hinder the crypto recovery.  The Fed’s stance on interest rates suggests that crypto may face a longer recovery period, as lower borrowing costs typically attract investors to riskier assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. With a prolonged pause in rate cuts, the upside for digital assets remains uncertain. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin2025  #BTC","gravity_id":"371857393","id":20604,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T21:50:02.967Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T22:20:04.758Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-11T21:44:44.788Z","text_content":"The $ETH  Eco Month on MEXC is designed to reward both new and experienced traders.

With $BTC  steadying the broader market, this is where both sides are quietly positioning for the next major move.  $ETH  is holding just above support at $3,179 after that liquidity grab near $3,471 pushed price back into the range. Whether it rebounds straight toward $4,000 or dips to $2,600 first, the setup still leans toward expansion - the only open question now is how it decides to get there. 🚀  #ETH  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"371861168","id":20768,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T23:50:03.192Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T01:00:04.238Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-11T23:50:06.092Z","text_content":"$ETH  chart first key reaction appeared around $3100, marking the top of the range as sellers stepped in.

The emergence of a high-volume bearish daily candle after a consecutive rally, coupled with the breakdown of the key $3200 support-turned-resistance level on the 4-hour chart, signals that the short-term uptrend has likely concluded. The market is now transitioning into a corrective phase to seek new equilibrium.\r \r  👀Daily\r Price Action: A large bearish candlestick with a notable upper shadow formed following three bullish days. The increase in volume on this down move confirms active distribution.\r Key Levels: The close above the EMA9 offers minor support, but the failure to hold higher prices is the dominant narrative. The next significant support zone is lower.\r Momentum: The daily MACD lines remain upward-sloping, but the critical detail is the histogram beginning a sequential decline, providing early confirmation of waning bullish momentum.\r \r  👀4H\r Price Action: The critical technical development is the confirmed breakdown of the $3200 support level. The subsequent retest of this level as resistance (~$3273 high) validates its new role as a ceiling for price.\r Structure: The bullish moving average alignment is now under threat as price trades below the EMA200 and key short-term averages.\r Momentum: The MACD has completed a bearish cross below its signal line, formally indicating that momentum on this timeframe has turned negative.\r \r  👀1H\r Price Action: Price action shows a weak, low-volume bounce from the EMA200, struggling to regain lost ground. This is indicative of a counter-trend move within a newly established downtrend.\r Momentum: The 1H MACD's bullish cross is feeble and lacks conviction, often a precursor to another leg down or continued choppy consolidation.","gravity_id":"371864054","id":20813,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T00:30:02.677Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T02:40:03.954Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-12T00:59:59.222Z","text_content":"$ETH ETH Decision Point\nETH is hovering around $3,210 with no clear direction yet.\n\n\nDisclaimer: Not financial advice.\nFollow us for more fast ETH insights.\n\n\nTell us your view:\nNext big move:\nUP or DOWN?\n\n\nType UP or DOWN in the comments.","gravity_id":"371861572","id":20832,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T01:00:02.712Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T03:00:03.796Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-12T00:57:21.900Z","text_content":"$ETH - Trade Idea\n\nEthereum is being rejected by a previous support turned resistance.\n\nOn top of that, there is a clean bearish divergence forming in the 3-day timeframe, with a death cross already confirming this as well.\n\nA bit of a mid-term short play, but it should play out.","gravity_id":"371864199","id":20833,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T01:00:02.976Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T02:50:04.406Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-12T01:05:10.766Z","text_content":"JUST IN: Vanguard just opened the gates, over 50 million clients can now access spot crypto ETFs for $BTC  , $ETH  , XRP, and Solana.

No multisig committees. Just cryptographic proofs that verify cross-chain messages without revealing underlying data.\n4/ When you bridge from Vara → Ethereum:\n\n1️⃣ Your tokens are locked, generating a message in an outbound queue\n2️⃣ A Merkle root is computed (~3 sec)\n3️⃣ ZKPs prove the message was signed by Vara's 66 validators\n4️⃣ Ethereum verifies the proof onchain—trustlessly\n5/ Bridging from Ethereum → Vara uses an onchain Ethereum light client with Sync Committee integration.\n\nThis tracks Ethereum block headers and validates consensus signatures from 512 rotating validators, allowing Vara to verify Ethereum state without running a full node.\n6/ The Vara ⇌ Ethereum Bridge uses permissionless relayers to transport ZK proofs, Merkle roots, and finalized headers between chains.\n\nKey point: relayers can't validate or interpret data. If one goes offline, another picks up the task—ensuring network liveness.\n7/ Currently supported assets:\n\nVARA\nETH\nUSDT\nUSDC\nwBTC\n\nTransfers complete in ~20-30 minutes (due to Ethereum finality), with fees paid in the origin chain's native token.\n8/ Built on Gear Protocol's actor model, Vara enables:\n\n🔹 Parallel execution via independent actors\n🔹 Asynchronous messaging between contracts\n🔹 Gasless transactions (voucher system)\n🔹 Signless transactions (temporary sub-accounts)\n9/ Secured by Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS):\n\n✅ 66 active validators sign Merkle roots\n✅ VARA token holders nominate validators & earn rewards\n✅ OpenGov framework for governance\n✅ Fully audited bridge contracts\n\nCheck out the bridge here: https://vara.network/vara-bridge\n10/ Coming soon: https://eth.vara.network/ testnet launch\n\nThis execution layer will let Ethereum dApps offload intensive computations to Vara—improving scalability WITHOUT relocating off Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThink: same security, better performance.\n11/ The future of blockchain is multi-chain, but it must be trustless.\n\nRead the full @MessariCrypto report here: https://messari.io/report/vara-how-bridges-power-interoperability-and-scalability-for-ethereum\n\nStart bridging: https://bridge.vara.network/?network=mainnet\nBuild on http://vara.network\n\nThe infrastructure for scalable, interoperable Web3 is here.","gravity_id":"371881363","id":22239,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T16:00:08.891Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T16:10:10.484Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-12T15:52:25.910Z","text_content":"$ETH wtf?","gravity_id":"371882335","id":22240,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T16:00:09.199Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T16:10:10.626Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-12T15:49:45.063Z","text_content":"Maple assets on @aave: $600M+ in total deposits across @ethereum and @Plasma in less than two months.\n\nThis is what real, scalable and capital-efficient DeFi is.\n\nJust use syrupUSDT on Aave.
