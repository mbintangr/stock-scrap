Itaú says Bitcoin behaves differently from stocks or bonds, often reacting to global stress and currency moves. That’s exactly why it can help balance risk when traditional assets struggle.  The bank is also expanding into crypto directly, offering BTC and $ETH  trading with in-house custody. The message is clear: for Itaú, Bitcoin isn’t a trade - it’s a long-term strategic asset.   #BTC Price Analysis#  #ETH   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"371903423","id":23760,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T09:30:02.911Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T10:00:06.604Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-13T09:25:24.836Z","text_content":"🚨 Bitmine deepens its #Ethereum  exposure.  \r \r The firm acquired an additional 14,959 $ETH  worth $46 million, reinforcing growing institutional conviction in ETH as a strategic long-term digital asset.  \r \r Read More: https://cryptotale.org/","gravity_id":"371904127","id":23761,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T09:30:03.151Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T09:50:03.932Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-13T09:22:18.457Z","text_content":"￼ $BTC losing momentum \nthe odds that we might get #BTC back to $100k keeps reducing ￼ $BTC \n\n￼ $ETH ON the Other hands seems Stable on $3k ","gravity_id":"371904095","id":23763,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T09:30:03.631Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T09:50:04.220Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-13T09:20:54.775Z","text_content":"$ETH  holds higher lows above 20, 50, and 100 EMAs, keeping buyers in control as consolidation forms near Fibonacci resistance.   🔹 Support at $3,120 maintains trend strength.

Each push higher is getting sold quickly, showing sellers are defending this zone aggressively.\n\nVolume on the upside remains weak compared to the previous sell-off, which confirms that this move is driven more by short covering than real buying demand. As long as  $ETH stays below key resistance, the market structure favors lower highs and continuation to the downside, making shorts more favorable than longs.\n\nFrom a sentiment perspective, traders are still cautious after the recent dump, and broader market uncertainty is keeping risk appetite low.
