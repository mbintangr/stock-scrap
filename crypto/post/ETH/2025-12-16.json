The outlook favors continuation lower unless key resistance levels are decisively reclaimed.  \r \r Price remains under pressure, with critical support near 2907 and resistance around 3045. A decisive close below 2907 could open the path toward 2716, reinforcing bearish bias. Conversely, reclaiming and holding above 3177 would shift momentum bullishly.

The $2500 level remains the point of control (POC), from which I expect a bounce. Current buying prices are still attractive, but we can't relax. We've now entered an imbalance zone that we've bounced off before, and buy-ups are visible now. However, this time, we'll likely either fully retrace it or move into an illiquid order block (illiquid because it didn't absorb liquidity from the previous low, so the chance of breaking it is high). No matter how you analyze the current charts, the most attractive buying points will still remain below $2500. Time will tell: will we bounce or continue plunging to $1000?

Ethereum $ETH   is trading at $2,952.39, down 6.41% over the past 24 hours, as broader market weakness and profit-taking pressure weigh on prices. One major factor behind the decline is heightened trading activity, with 24-hour volume rising 43.62% to $29.14 billion. Such volume spikes often signal short-term selling as traders lock in gains after recent rallies.  Market structure also plays a role. ETH’s market cap stands at $356.33 billion, closely matching its fully diluted valuation of $356.23 billion, as the entire 120.69 million ETH supply is already circulating. With no maximum supply cap, Ethereum’s price can be sensitive to shifts in demand and overall market sentiment.  Despite the dip, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency and the backbone of DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 ecosystems.

Like swapping tokens across chains or executing complex trades, without needing to handle the underlying steps. \n\nAt its core, the system operates on the @NEARProtocol, leveraging smart contracts to orchestrate these intents in a scalable, extensible manner that breaks down \"walled gardens\" between chains. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1) Intent Creation: Submit signed goals (e.g., \"swap ETH for USDC\") via natural language/APIs; broadcast to network, no bridges needed.\n\n2) Solver Competition: Solvers parse intents, aggregate on/off-chain liquidity, compete via RFQ for best quotes; monitor/exclude poor performers for efficiency beating Binance 50%+ of time on asset price.\n\n3) Execution: Settle via NEAR verifier (2-3s finality). Chain Signatures equip contracts with keys via MPC for cross-chain control/confirmation (e.g., Zcash/Bitcoin), no exposed keys or bridges; protects from MEV/failures. \n\nYou now have unified seamless blockchain experiences at scale.\n\nCredit to @therollupco, @chronear, @alexauroradev for letting the world know.","gravity_id":"372004807","id":31084,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T17:30:02.790Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T17:50:04.279Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-16T17:39:27.888Z","text_content":"🚨BlackRock has just deposited 47,463 $ETH  worth $140.2 million into Coinbase.\r \r When will this stop? #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372006712","id":31099,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T17:40:03.135Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T17:50:03.611Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-16T17:32:23.528Z","text_content":"$ETH  has largely exhausted its downside liquidity.
