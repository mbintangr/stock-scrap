capital concentration matters more than “themes.”\n• Global memecoin interest is down sharply, but the U.S. still anchors attention—soil for the next narrative remains.\n• Bottom line: direction is weak, but the market can swing hard both ways.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOn-chain & Technical Trends\n• Active wallets are trending lower—fewer participants = thinner market conditions.\n• A break below 85k risks re-igniting liquidation cascades; a break above 93k can accelerate short covering.\n• Implied volatility is turning up from the recent low-vol regime—ranges are starting to expand again.\n• Derivatives are driven more by “liquidation amplitude” than clean directional trend.\n• Lower exchange balances / tighter supply can become fuel for sharp rebounds (especially once leverage resets).\n• Ongoing LTH distribution looks more like generational rotation than pure weakness—new demand absorption is key.\n• With certain sell walls removed, the next major resistance is likely around 95,000.\n• Today: watch volume and flows before price narratives.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nSentiment\n• Extreme Fear (11) can precede seller exhaustion, but a bounce is not the same as safety.\n• Thinner liquidity increases the frequency of “dump → snapback” wicks.\n• U.S. risk appetite hasn’t fully disengaged (even with fading hype), leaving potential ignition points.\n• Liquidity is concentrating again (Binance as the center), amplifying “where the book is deepest” dynamics.\n• Near-term edge: spot-heavy positioning, scale in, keep size smaller.\n• Ahead of event risk (BOJ / U.S. political headlines), positioning tends to stay lighter.\n• Conclusion: focus less on fear level, more on whether leverage has been flushed.\n• Watch whether rebounds show real follow-through or just mechanical covering.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nU.S. Traditional Markets\n• U.S. unemployment is at 4.6%, wages are cooling—slowdown signals are becoming clearer.\n• Sticky inflation + slowing growth = rate-cut expectations mixed with higher uncertainty (volatility risk).\n• Fed leadership speculation is becoming a market driver—“who steers” matters alongside policy itself.\n• China real estate continues to deteriorate, remaining a structural global risk backdrop.\n• Meanwhile, tokenization and on-chain finance adoption by major institutions remains a medium-term tailwind.\n• Gold and central-bank buying reinforce the broader “currency debasement” trend.\n• BOJ hike (largely priced) still risks reaction-driven volatility via FX/carry channels.\n• Bottom line: medium-term liquidity themes are supportive;

Same markets, better rails, less friction.  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#  $BTC  #Bitcoin","gravity_id":"372023972","id":32074,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T06:00:03.169Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T06:30:04.482Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T06:05:41.523Z","text_content":"🔥 UPDATE: BitMine adds another 48,049 $ETH worth around $140M to its treasury.","gravity_id":"372025179","id":32089,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T06:10:03.652Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T06:40:03.646Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T06:05:05.813Z","text_content":"🚨BlackRock has just deposited 47,463 $ETH  worth $140.2 million into Coinbase.  \r \r When will this stop?","gravity_id":"372026076","id":32090,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T06:10:03.840Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T06:40:03.954Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T06:04:29.598Z","text_content":"$ETH Good big rewards Big short all in.","gravity_id":"372025163","id":32091,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T06:10:04.030Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T06:40:04.249Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T06:01:45.042Z","text_content":"JPMorgan Unveils Tokenized Fund on Ethereum With $100M Capital \nhttps://coincryptonewz.com/jpmorgan-unveils-tokenized-fund-on-ethereum-with-100m-capital/\n#ethereum #crypto #coincryptonewz","gravity_id":"372026018","id":32092,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T06:10:04.215Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T06:40:04.547Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T06:01:24.781Z","text_content":"$ETH END OF CRYPTO !!!","gravity_id":"372025110","id":32093,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T06:10:04.398Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T06:30:04.187Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T06:15:05.839Z","text_content":"⚡️JUST NOW: #BlackRock just moved 47,463 $ETH  worth $140 MILLION to #Coinbase.","gravity_id":"372025274","id":32114,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T06:20:02.676Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T07:00:05.972Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T06:10:45.056Z","text_content":"🚨BREAKING: 🔥Bitmine has added an additional 48,049 $ETH valued at approximately $140M to its treasury.","gravity_id":"372026126","id":32115,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T06:20:02.971Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T06:50:05.013Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T06:37:45.513Z","text_content":"$ETH Price: $2,941 (+0.07%)  \n- Update: ETH remains resilient, supported by PeerDAS upgrade and ETF optimism.  \n- Trend: Holding above $2,900 despite broader market volatility.  \n#ETH #ETH 2# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372026409","id":32148,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T06:40:02.078Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T07:10:03.792Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T06:35:01.326Z","text_content":"LIQUIDATION CHAMP REFUSES TO QUIT\n\nMachi Big Brother, the so-called liquidation champion, just opened a 25x leveraged long on #ETH  at $4,500, putting $13.15M on the line.\n\nSince the Oct 11 crash, he’s been wiped out 200+ times, losing nearly $23M.\n\nCould this finally be his breakthrough trade?\n$ETH","gravity_id":"372025479","id":32149,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T06:40:02.377Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T07:10:03.973Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T06:30:57.937Z","text_content":"BREAKING 🚨 \n\n🇺🇸 Tom Lee’s Bitmine just purchased $140.58 million worth of  $ETH.\n\n\n#ETH #Bitmine #Crypto #CryptoNews","gravity_id":"372026330","id":32151,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T06:40:02.981Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T07:00:05.773Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T06:49:16.968Z","text_content":"$ETH  dropped below the 3,000 support level after spot ETH ETFs recorded net outflows of 224.7 million dollars, marking the largest single-day withdrawal in several weeks.

Not only did Celo’s mission go mainstream, the metrics made it obvious\n\nKeep reading @RegenRene's end-of-year letter for the highlights ↓ \nThis year, most of crypto cycled through familiar narratives, hot takes & resurfaced debates, like L1s vs. L2s (spoiler alert: the latter will win), Celo was hyperfocused on something less exciting in the short term, but far more important in the long term: proof \nWe shipped milestone infra, like our L2 migration, and reached all-time adoption highs, becoming the #1 L2 in DAUs ahead of @Base and @Worldcoin, and crypto’s #1 transport layer for USDT by WAUs ahead of @TronDAO, thanks to everyday users in emerging markets \nCrypto went mainstream, flooded w/ corporatized chains & countless “logo x logo” announcements, we got something rare: PMF & a roaring distribution engine\n\nBuilt from the ground up, hand-in-hand with partners like @Opera, architects of @MiniPay, crypto’s fastest growing use case https://twitter.com/1429725410003062785/status/1997779252758921705\nOur teams have quietly delivered what countless projects have failed to achieve. Not ideas. Not intentions. Not spectacle masquerading as progress, or grandstanding product reveals engineered for the cameras and timeline rather than for the benefit of everyday users https://twitter.com/231208649/status/1945602337533562891\nWe're talking about usage that repeats, product that becomes habit\n\nNot only have we cracked the code to find product-market fit, what the industry has been starved for, we've done this across the Global South for the forest conservationist in Ñuiyanzhi, Colombia, the local merchant in Nairobi, Kenya, and the crypto builder in Lagos, Nigeria, among many others\nNetworks grow because the experience is better & the plumbing (boringly) works, not because a story is louder\n\nFor all the shiny projects that captured mindshare & the trends du jour only to fizzle out, our staying power is a testament to prioritizing mission over marketing, verifiable usage over hype\n2025 was the year of compounding adoption, when impact became proof:\n\n→ 790K peak daily active users (#1 L2 for DAUs)\n→ 3.3M+ peak weekly active users of USDT (#1 chain)\n→ 5.2M+ new users in 2025 (79% first-time users)\n→ $65.9B+ stablecoin volume YTD (+142% vs 2024) \nThis adoption didn’t happen by accident. It was earned day to day through deliberate choices, difficult engineering, and a commitment to meet users where they are\n\nOne of the most important things we did this year––migrating to an @Ethereum Layer 2––was also the least visible to most users\nYet we chose to do the hard thing, crossing a defining threshold and setting a standard for others to follow suit. We returned home to Ethereum with 100+ day-one partners, unlocking:\n\n→ Deeper Ethereum alignment\n→ Easier interoperability and integration paths\n→ A foundation built for scaling without compromising user experience\n→ Costs reduction of 99.8%, supercharging chain revenue by 10x\n\nThe experience didn’t have to change for users or builders. Celo remained mobile-first, low-cost, fast, and practical\nWe stopped talking about crypto as a “feature,” but an assumption, because we knew that for the mission to go mainstream, the product had to be invisible. We saw more moments where:\n\n→ Someone sends money across a border and doesn’t think about settlement\n→ Someone pays or gets paid and doesn’t think about fees\n→ Someone uses a mini app and doesn’t think about chain selection\n→ Someone saves in a stable asset and doesn’t think about volatility\n\nThat’s not just adoption, it’s normalization\nCelo has always believed that the “real world” isn’t niche, but a destination. Impact isn’t about idealism or virtue signaling, but concrete execution and practice. This year, we turned aspirational belief into a platform advantage, with a plan to evolve our tokenomics to support the network’s tremendous growth\nDistribution strengthened through projects #BuiltOnCelo like @Opera's stablecoin wallet @MiniPay, with 11M+ wallets & 300M+ transactions processed\n\nAs we extend our partnership, we aim to bring MiniPay to Opera's 300M+ users as we work toward onboarding 1 billion people to the digital economy by 2030\nDeFi building blocks also became stronger through integrations of @Aave v3, @VelodromeFi & @Uniswap v4, joining @chainlink, @CurveFinance, @Bancor, while Self-verified pools pushed stablecoin liquidity even deeper https://twitter.com/1511770076738990082/status/1907848272603132226\n@SelfProtocol's @EthDenver launch was a category-defining breakthrough: introducing a zk-powered proof-of-humanity & identity layer leveraging government-issued biometric passports & IDs\n\nSelf is partnered w/ @GoogleCloud, @aave, @velodrome & now supports India's Aadhaar ID https://twitter.com/1882843792488980481/status/1948005278554702005\nBuilding on this massive distribution for 2026, we're scaling responsibly toward a trillion-dollar onchain economy:\n\n→ Making stablecoin payments feel native everywhere\n→ Expanding the mini-app economy\n→ Strengthening rails for trust & safety\nNot because we’re better at narratives, but because we’ve been obsessed with the same thing for years: making the real world the center of our design––a focal point that the industry’s crypto OGs recognize and respect \n@jinglejamOP As @VitalikButerin said at this year's L2 Hardfork Party, the Celo community exemplifies the best of what Ethereum & crypto has to offer\n\nThank you to the Celo community for building with us & bringing our shared vision for a more prosperous world to life 💛 https://twitter.com/1009135067153616896/status/1904821395298668906\nRead Rene's full letter for a comprehensive look at the year & his vision for what's to come: https://medium.com/@celoorg/2025-year-in-review-while-crypto-talked-celo-delivered-1f2472952abf","gravity_id":"372039413","id":32917,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T14:51:11.117Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T15:00:07.758Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T14:48:04.583Z","text_content":"$ETH god save your money 🥰 next price is $2700","gravity_id":"372039399","id":32918,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T14:51:11.420Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T15:00:07.942Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T14:37:45.134Z","text_content":"How Vara.eth works:\n\nEthereum emits events.\nVara.eth executes logic in parallel.\n\nPrograms run as independent actors.\nResults are validator-signed and anchored back to Ethereum.\n\nEthereum decides when things happen.\nVara.eth decides how they execute.\n\nExplore more: https://t.co/n2tzHe9Ilr","gravity_id":"372038932","id":32919,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T14:51:11.725Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T15:00:08.124Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T14:37:40.765Z","text_content":"What's the next big narrative in crypto 🤔  $BTC  $ETH","gravity_id":"372040215","id":32920,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T14:51:12.040Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T15:00:08.309Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T14:35:48.635Z","text_content":"Market Analysis.   #BITCOIN  – Current Price: $86,800.
