Could've been prepared. Let's take a look.  How could one have traded this manipulation? In this situation, there are three types of people: 1.  Went all-in on long positions; 2.  Analyzed the situation and went short (not all-in); 3.  Slept peacefully.  By a fortunate coincidence, I didn't have top-50 coins connected to my pump/dump monitor at that moment, so only liquidation alerts were active. Yet, even with that, you could have calmly caught a move.  I received an alert for a 4.5M$ volume of short position liquidation (wow, I was genuinely shocked). I open the chart and see the market is being pumped – interesting. I quickly glance at the indicators to see what they're telling me: I see a distribution pattern, check the volumes, look at CVD and OI, and decide to wait a bit (in such volatile moves, it's better to catch your breath).  I continue watching the indicators: CVD is rising while OI is falling (shorts are being opened). I remember that 4.5M$ short liquidation alert and decide to open a short position with a stop-loss. Why? Because the long/short ratio delta shows no sign of long dominance. The big players are shorting – it's time to ride with them. Then of course were long liquidation.     P.S. For those asking about data sources: I track such anomalies using specialized monitoring tools. If you're interested in the technical side, the names of the bots I use for this are in my CMC profile description. This isn't an ad, just full transparency about my process.","gravity_id":"372044819","id":33340,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T18:10:03.337Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T18:30:04.634Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T18:02:06.202Z","text_content":"$ETH Merry Christmas 🤣🤣🤣","gravity_id":"372044792","id":33342,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T18:10:03.962Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T18:20:05.333Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T18:01:32.500Z","text_content":"As a multi asset trader, I never imagined the idea of trading crypto assets $BTC  $ETH , Stocks, Forex and Commodities all in one platform.

Serious question for everyone here: Do you think $ETH   is genuinely building for a breakout here, or is this just a liquidity trap before a deeper sweep that nobody wants to admit?","gravity_id":"372051287","id":33817,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T22:10:02.805Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T22:30:04.839Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T22:01:18.964Z","text_content":"$ETH will hunt bears in 2026.\n\n\nBookmark this post and come back to it.\n\n\nI’m rarely wrong.","gravity_id":"372049873","id":33818,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T22:10:03.114Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T22:20:04.467Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T22:00:57.008Z","text_content":"$ETH bearish","gravity_id":"372050863","id":33819,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T22:10:03.418Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T22:20:04.771Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T22:00:30.199Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $ETH","gravity_id":"372049869","id":33820,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T22:10:03.724Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T22:20:05.085Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T22:17:49.039Z","text_content":"$ETH ETH Market Update\n\n\nETH is trading near $2,827 after a sharp pullback, as sellers defend key moving averages and momentum remains pressured across lower timeframes.\n\n\nDisclaimer: Not financial advice. Do your own research.\nFollow us for more fast ETH insights.\n\n\n1D Overview:\nETH continues to trend below the Bollinger mid-band (~$3,060), with price hovering near the lower band around $2,800. RSI remains subdued (mid-30s), indicating weak momentum, while MACD stays negative, suggesting the broader corrective phase is still intact.\n\n\n4H Overview:\nOn the 4H chart, ETH rejected near $3,050–$3,100 and rolled over toward the $2,800 zone. RSI is deeply oversold on shorter periods, but there is no clear bullish divergence yet. Volume remains moderate, hinting at cautious participation rather than aggressive dip-buying.\n\n\n1H Overview:\nIntraday structure shows consolidation just above $2,790–$2,820 support after a strong sell-off. RSI(6) is attempting to stabilise from oversold levels, while MACD is flattening, indicating a potential short-term pause or minor bounce—but trend strength remains weak.\n\n\nKey Levels:\nSupport: $2,790, $2,720, $2,620\nResistance: $2,900, $3,050, $3,330\n\n\nOutlook:\nBias remains neutral to slightly bearish while ETH holds below $3,050. A reclaim and hold above $3,100 would improve short-term structure, while a loss of $2,790 risks a deeper move toward $2,620. Traders should watch for volume expansion and RSI divergence for confirmation of any trend shift.","gravity_id":"372052310","id":33837,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T22:20:02.890Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T23:00:04.628Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T22:16:45.041Z","text_content":"Bonus Prediction - Bitcoin’s correlation to equities will fall.\n\nBitcoin’s still moving with stocks.\n\nBut this trend is changing.\n\nRight now, the “correlation between Bitcoin and stocks is higher than it’s been,” sitting around “0.4-ish,” which is “considered a low correlation,” but “it’s not zero.”\n\nCompare that to gold: “Gold correlation to stocks is very low probably like 0.1.”\n\nThe claim here is 2026 flips the driver.\n\nWhen “macro conditions are primary you see them moving together.”\n\nBut as “crypto specific factors will be more important than they were in the past,” you get a market where:\n\n“Things specific to Bitcoin will drive Bitcoin… Things specific to ETH will drive ETH.\"\n\nIf that happens, correlation doesn’t just drift.\n\n“We think it’s going to go down substantially.”\n\n2026 Crypto Predictions w/ @Matt_Hougan & @RasterlyRock from @BitwiseInvest 🎬\nListen to the full episode👇\nhttps://www.bankless.com/podcast/10-crypto-predictions-for-2026\n\nSpotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/08JICOFiqcJOsZEFE7Og1u\n\nYouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9vvH49_dus","gravity_id":"372051415","id":33838,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T22:20:03.200Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T22:40:04.377Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T22:15:28.072Z","text_content":"$ETH I did something most founders are too afraid to do.\n\nI built everything:\na verified contract,\na live website,\na limited 10M supply,\na narrative with purpose.\n\nAnd then I stopped.\n\nNo marketing.\nNo hype.\nNo promises.\n\nThis token has been inactive since July by design.\n\nWhy?\nBecause this is a social experiment.\n\nThe project does not start when I talk.\nIt starts when someone has the guts to act.\n\nThe first buyer doesn’t buy a token.\nHe buys probability.\nHe buys the right to say: “I moved first.”\n\nIf nothing happens, nothing happens.\nIf someone presses buy — the game begins.\n\nMost people will watch.\nA few will act.\n\nLet’s see who you are.\n\nFind www . thepugnisher . com","gravity_id":"372052277","id":33839,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T22:20:03.505Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T22:40:04.683Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-17T22:15:24.283Z","text_content":"A whale on Hyperliquid just saw a $10.4M $ETH  /USD long liquidated in a single order, according to Coinglass.

RSI on 1H and 4H is near oversold territory, suggesting selling pressure is stretched, but higher-timeframe momentum is still bearish.\n\n\nTrade Tips (Short-Term Focus):\n\n\n• Range Traders:\nLook for scalp opportunities between $2,790–$2,900. Long setups are higher probability near the lower band support with tight stops. Avoid chasing price mid-range.\n\n\n• Dip Buyers:\nIf price holds above $2,780–$2,800 and RSI shows bullish divergence on 1H, a short-term bounce toward $2,900–$3,000 is possible. Confirmation via volume is key.\n\n\n• Breakdown Risk:\nA clean loss of $2,780 with strong volume opens downside toward $2,720 → $2,620. In that case, patience is preferred over early entries.\n\n\n• Trend Reversal Watch:\nBullish structure only improves on a reclaim and hold above $3,050–$3,100. Until then, rallies may face selling pressure.\n\n\nKey Levels:\nSupport: $2,800, $2,720, $2,620\nResistance: $2,900, $3,050\n\n\nOutlook:\nETH remains in a corrective phase, favoring disciplined range trading over aggressive trend positions.

It’s about who controls how that intelligence moves value.  As agents begin to make decisions and transact on our behalf, the old model of centralized platforms starts to break. You can’t have autonomous agents running on rails designed for permission, rent-seeking, and gatekeeping.  $ETH   changes the base layer by making value programmable and neutral. $BOSON  extends that by adding a decentralized commerce layer where agents and humans can trade real-world assets without intermediaries.  From this angle, cognitive automation isn’t a tech upgrade. It’s a structural shift. Intelligence moves to the edge, commerce moves onchain, and value stops pooling at the center. ﻿#Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372075744","id":35655,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T17:30:05.190Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T17:30:05.190Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-18T17:38:56.140Z","text_content":"🚨BREAKING:   Tom Lee’s BitMine just bought another 30,075 $ETH  worth $88.73 million.","gravity_id":"372077044","id":35674,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T17:40:02.164Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T17:50:03.502Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-18T17:38:22.800Z","text_content":"🚨BREAKING:   Tom Lee’s BitMine just bought another 30,075 $ETH  worth $88.73 million.","gravity_id":"372077041","id":35675,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T17:40:02.483Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T17:50:03.823Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-18T17:37:59.713Z","text_content":"🚨BREAKING:\n\n\nTom Lee’s BitMine just bought another 30,075 $ETH worth $88.73 million.","gravity_id":"372076906","id":35676,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T17:40:02.812Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T17:50:04.045Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-18T17:37:55.009Z","text_content":"Another Solid confirmation, We're going down on $ETH .
