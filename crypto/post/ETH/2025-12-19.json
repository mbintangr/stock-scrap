As more data accumulates on the network, running a full Ethereum node becomes more expensive and resource-heavy. This could limit participation to larger players, reducing decentralization.  To address this, researchers are exploring ideas like state expiry, separating frequently used data from old data, and making nodes less dependent on storing everything.  These are long-term research efforts, but the goal is clear: scale Ethereum without sacrificing decentralization. ﻿#Ethereum  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372080509","id":35870,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T19:30:02.825Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T19:50:05.507Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-18T19:28:00.206Z","text_content":"🚨 LATEST: #Tether  CEO Paolo Ardoino says an AI-driven market bubble could be $BTC  biggest risk in 2026, while remaining bullish on long-term adoption and tokenization.   ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#  $ETH","gravity_id":"372077633","id":35871,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T19:30:03.145Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T19:40:03.526Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-18T19:20:03.232Z","text_content":"$ETHTrump came to power with promises of making America the “capital of crypto.”\nHowever, during this process, small investors suffered significant losses in the crypto market.\nThe rhetoric did not match reality, and once again, ordinary people paid the price.\nMay God damn both America and Trump.,.,","gravity_id":"372078471","id":35872,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T19:30:03.468Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T19:40:03.724Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-18T19:19:34.117Z","text_content":"$ETH bearish","gravity_id":"372079474","id":35873,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T19:30:03.793Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T19:40:03.928Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-18T19:39:58.977Z","text_content":"$ETH\nMONEY LOST  😎 1500$ SOON\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH\nITS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE 🤭","gravity_id":"372079587","id":35891,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T19:40:02.268Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T19:50:04.539Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-18T19:32:31.033Z","text_content":"🚨 JUST IN: Bitwise has officially filed with the SEC to launch a $SUI  ETF.

The problem isn’t open-source code or validators - it’s that only a small group of experts can truly understand how the protocol works. When that happens, trust shifts from code to people.  As Ethereum keeps adding upgrades, layers, and abstractions, complexity becomes a silent risk. Users and developers end up relying on a handful of highly technical contributors, which slowly weakens decentralization. This is why many still point to $BTC  as a simpler system that’s easier to independently verify.  The takeaway: Vitalik believes Ethereum should prioritize simplicity over features. Fewer moving parts mean more people can verify the system themselves - and that’s where real trustlessness comes from.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #ETH#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372078828","id":36000,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T20:30:02.942Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T20:40:05.038Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-18T20:23:15.925Z","text_content":"$ETH   WHO IS IDIOT BUYING NOW SPOT OR FUTURE  LOOK AT HIM NEXT HOURS 😱😱😱 LIKE THIS   EVERYDAY HE WILL SUPPORT AND WILL BE NOT ENOUGH  FOR NEXT TEN MONTH HE WILL SUPPORT AND HE WILL SELL HIS HOUSE AND WILL BE NOT ENOUGH  🤌🤌🤌 WILL COME IN BEAR AND BULL TRAP  18-12-2025","gravity_id":"372078821","id":36001,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T20:30:03.261Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T20:30:03.261Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-18T20:23:05.267Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $ETH","gravity_id":"372079813","id":36002,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T20:30:03.591Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T20:30:03.591Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-18T20:22:21.650Z","text_content":"$ETH When BTC was at 126k, people said it couldn't go back down to 95k.\nWhen it was at 95k, they said it couldn't reach 85k.\nNow that it's at 85k, they'll say it can't go down to 70k.\n\n\nThen they'll say it can't go down to 40k.\n\n\nIt's always been like this.\n\n\nA lot of people who bought in higher are still talking nonsense... until the day they start selling at 30k 😂 👎👎","gravity_id":"372078817","id":36003,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T20:30:03.787Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T20:30:03.787Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-18T20:37:51.601Z","text_content":"$ETH guys im very confused, ive been hearing good news, rate cuts, a cooler cpi etc but why is it still crashing?

Price bounced nicely from $2,800 support and broke above key short-term moving averages. However, it faces critical resistance at the $3,000 psychological level. The horizontal trendline and MA99 overhead suggest caution before continuation.   Targets:  TP1: $3,050 TP2: $3,180 TP3: $3,320  Stop Loss: $2,820  The setup favors buyers if $3,000 breaks cleanly with volume.

However, this fragmentation restricts growth and innovation. If left unaddressed, the tokenized asset market could face annual losses of $30-$75 billion by 2030. To resolve this, the report calls for stronger cross-chain interoperability using protocols like Chainlink’s CCIP and Cosmos' IBC.

That means every single action on Amara happens on Odyssey itself. Swapping tokens, listing new pairs, adding liquidity, removing liquidity, claiming rewards; all of these actions trigger real on-chain transactions on Odyssey. This isn’t an external app or an off-chain system. It’s fully built into the chain.\n\nBecause of that, the gas fee for all Amara activity is paid in DIONE. So anyone who wants to interact with Amara, whether they’re coming from Base, Ethereum, or any other ecosystem, has to acquire DIONE to pay for gas. There’s no way around that. As Amara usage grows, gas usage grows, and that creates consistent, organic demand for DIONE tied directly to real activity.\n\nOn top of that, Amara is designed to attract users and liquidity from outside ecosystems. As those users bridge assets in and start trading or providing liquidity, they are automatically pulled into the Dione economy. They are no longer just external users, they now need DIONE to operate on Odyssey. This is one of the strongest ways to convert external attention into real ecosystem participation.\n\nThen there’s the TVL side of things. Amara introduces spot liquidity, LP positions, bonded liquidity, and longer-term locked capital. All of this contributes directly to the total value locked on the Odyssey chain. Higher TVL improves the overall strength, visibility, and credibility of the ecosystem, which benefits every project building on it, not just Amara.\n\nAs the perps infrastructure rolls out, there’s another layer of value. Certain pool configurations and risk structures require DIONE to be present in protocol-controlled pools. In those cases, the Amara team itself needs to acquire DIONE as part of the system design. That means real protocol-level demand, not speculative buying.\n\nThere’s also the possibility, not confirmed yet, but very realistic, that some trading pairs or routing paths involve DIONE directly. If and when that happens, it introduces even more swap volume, LP activity, and utility around the DIONE token. But even without this, DIONE already benefits significantly from gas usage and infrastructure demand alone.\n\nWhen you combine all of this, native deployment on Odyssey, gas fees paid in DIONE, external users being forced to acquire DIONE, rising TVL on the chain, protocol-level demand from perps, and potential future DIONE-based pools, you start to see the bigger picture.” - @god_xte","gravity_id":"372113181","id":37760,"createdAt":"2025-12-19T16:20:03.423Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T16:40:05.083Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-19T16:13:54.654Z","text_content":"Coinbase has taken legal action against Michigan, Illinois, and Connecticut, arguing that only the CFTC has authority over prediction markets.
