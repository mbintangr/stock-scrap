While it's clear that Japan's rate hike hasn't fully translated to the charts yet, I'm not convinced it will. The key difference between Japan's rate increase in 2024 and now is that back then, it was a complete surprise.  I'll be honest—I'm not the best at dissecting short-term, 1–4 hour scalp setups. But what the chart shows right now is a market designed to wear traders down, feeding them the needle of uncertainty—especially those who entered around $2,960. Without proper risk management, choosing the wrong side here will hurt. There's simply no meaningful buy-side interest at our current price level.  With the weekend here, Sunday or even tonight (Saturday) could still bring surprises. Key resistance zones are marked with rectangles on the chart—historically, such areas have been hard to break during a downtrend with zero buying momentum. I still believe we haven't found a bottom yet.  Once again, I'm seeing the narrative gain momentum: \"We've liquidated the longs, now it's time to hunt the shorts.\" Remember, those pushing this idea don't know any more than you do. And they *will* be right… eventually, because sooner or later, the market will turn on the shorts, too.  Here’s the essential takeaway: Your favorite influencer or analyst is navigating the same uncertainty as you are. The only difference is, they aren't dependent on your opinion, while you might be leaning on theirs. Watch them, draw inspiration, but always do your own research (DYOR). #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372127691","id":38919,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T06:30:02.755Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T06:50:05.850Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-20T06:38:53.028Z","text_content":"⚠️ ETH Warning: Over $600M exited Spot Ethereum ETFs in the week starting Dec 15, signaling rising institutional caution 📉  🏦 Institutional Outflows: BlackRock’s ETHA led with -$467M, followed by Fidelity (FETH) at -$35M and Grayscale (ETHE) at -$49M  💸 Total ETF outflows > $600M, highlighting a clear drop in institutional risk appetite around $2,886  📊 Liquidity Impact: Negative netflows at the weekly open weaken buy-side support and increase downside vulnerability  🔻 Market Context: These flows align with broader altcoin weakness and reinforce bearish momentum  🛑 Outlook: Until ETF inflows turn positive, $ETH  remains under pressure with risk of testing lower supports #ETH  #Ethereum  #ETF  #OnChain  #InstitutionalFlow","gravity_id":"372128291","id":38930,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T06:40:02.679Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T07:00:04.045Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-20T06:37:39.853Z","text_content":"$ETH Structural Rebound Zone\n\n\nTP1: 3,120\n\n\nTP2: 3,320\n\n\nTP3: 3,600\n\n\nSL: 2,750\n$ETH\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Altcoin Season# #BNBChain#","gravity_id":"372127766","id":38931,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T06:40:03.019Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T07:00:04.258Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-20T06:35:19.450Z","text_content":"$ETH   to 7000 dollar lets goo! it has started !!!

Historically, similar patterns have aligned with periods of accumulation and stronger holder conviction.  This trend suggests that a growing portion of ETH holders may be positioning for the long term rather than short-term trading, tightening liquid supply across centralized exchanges.

Many DeFi products look impressive on paper but feel heavy in practice. As market conditions fluctuate, especially during uncertain phases, users tend to simplify their stack rather than expand it.  That’s why ecosystem-native tools quietly gain ground. On TON, decentralized exchanges designed specifically for its architecture offer a noticeably smoother experience. STONfi is a good example of this approach: instead of adapting models from $ETH  ecosystems, it aligns directly with how TON users interact on-chain.  These design decisions don’t trend on social media - but they compound over time.  What matters more to you when choosing a DEX: features or ease of use?  #TON  #DeFi  #CryptoUX","gravity_id":"372137075","id":39662,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T13:50:04.729Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T13:50:04.729Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-20T13:42:22.349Z","text_content":"Crypto legend Arthur Hayes made a bold move!

When liquidity dries up, tokens without real use cases tend to fade quickly. What remains are assets that are integrated into essential on-chain actions - swaps, fees, and liquidity provisioning.  Within TON, token activity increasingly revolves around native DeFi usage rather than external speculation. STONfi sits at the center of this flow, enabling tokens to interact naturally within the ecosystem instead of relying on bridges or external venues. This kind of setup often strengthens token relevance over time.  We’ve seen similar patterns on larger networks like $ETH , just much later in their lifecycle.

One of the most overlooked aspects of token design is velocity. Many tokens gain relevance not because they’re locked up, but because they’re constantly used: swapped, paired, and routed through DeFi.  STONfi highlights this dynamic well inside TON. As a native DEX, it becomes a natural hub where ecosystem tokens find liquidity and real demand. Compared to ecosystems where tokens rely heavily on $ETH  pairs, TON-native tokens benefit from a more localized and organic flow.  This kind of movement doesn’t always create hype, but it creates resilience.  Do you think token velocity matters more than scarcity in the long run?  #TON  #Tokens  #DeFi","gravity_id":"372134608","id":39683,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T14:10:03.496Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T14:20:04.504Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-20T14:01:01.130Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $ETH","gravity_id":"372134580","id":39684,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T14:10:03.854Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T14:20:04.879Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-20T14:00:58.478Z","text_content":"I’m bearish on $ETH","gravity_id":"372138195","id":39685,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T14:10:04.091Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T14:20:05.222Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-20T14:00:42.518Z","text_content":"$ETH\n\n2026 could surprise a lot of people...","gravity_id":"372137159","id":39686,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T14:10:04.307Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T14:20:05.570Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-20T13:59:05.634Z","text_content":"🚨 Ethereum’s exchange supply has fallen to its lowest level since 2016, signaling reduced sell pressure as more $ETH  moves into long-term storage.   #ETH  #Ethereum","gravity_id":"372138186","id":39687,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T14:10:04.520Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T14:10:04.520Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-20T13:52:45.032Z","text_content":"This one hurts. \n\nOne copy-paste, $50,000,000 gone. \n\nThe victim did everything \"by the book.\"\n\nThey sent a $50 test transaction to their intended address to be safe. \n\nBut scammers were watching.
