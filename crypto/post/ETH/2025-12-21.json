However, these connections are largely through institutions and associates rather than any direct tie to Nakamoto himself, whose true identity remains unknown. Claims that Epstein \"was\" Satoshi or directly sponsored him are speculative conspiracy theories without credible evidence.\n\nBelow is a breakdown based on the documented links:\n\nEpstein's Funding of MIT and Bitcoin Development\n\nEpstein donated approximately $850,000 to MIT between 2002 and 2017, with portions supporting the MIT Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative (DCI). The DCI, launched in 2015, played a key role in sustaining Bitcoin Core developers (e.g., Gavin Andresen and Wladimir van der Laan) during a funding shortfall at the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nEpstein visited MIT at least nine times, often through unlogged \"back doors,\" with his involvement kept secretive staff reportedly referred to him as \"Voldemort\" internally to avoid public association. MIT officials approved the funds privately, and the donations were underreported.\n\nThis indirectly tied Epstein's money to Bitcoin's technical maintenance, as DCI grants helped keep core development afloat during critical early years.\n\nMeetings and Discussions with Crypto Figures\n\nIn September 2014, Epstein's emails list \"satoshi (bitcoin)\" as a potential attendee for a UN Climate Week event in New York, alongside figures like Peter Thiel and Larry Summers.This entry has fueled speculation, especially since it occurred shortly after the hacking of Nakamoto's original email accounts (September 8, 2014) and the death of Hal Finney (a early Bitcoin collaborator often speculated to be part of the Satoshi persona) in August 2014.However, there's no confirmation this \"satoshi\" was Nakamoto - it could refer to a Bitcoin-related contact, an alias, or even a typo/misattribution.\nEpstein hosted private meetings at his Manhattan mansion, including one with Brock Pierce (early Bitcoin investor and Tether co-founder) and Larry Summers (former U.S. Treasury Secretary), where they discussed Bitcoin's potential opportunities and risks.\n\nIn 2018, Epstein emailed Steve Bannon seeking advice on cryptocurrency taxes, including how to receive, distribute, and use coins while navigating campaign finance laws. Bannon connected him to experts.\n\nEpstein's Personal Interest in Crypto\nEpstein's Amazon purchase history from 2017 shows he bought books on Bitcoin, Ethereum, blockchain technology, and related topics, indicating a \"deep fascination\" as he sought to rebuild his network post-conviction.\n\nContext on Speculation and Lack of Direct Evidence\n\nThese revelations come from U.S. House Oversight Committee documents and leaked emails released in late 2025, highlighting Epstein's broader influence in tech and finance circles.They show Epstein had access to developers, investors, and policymakers in the crypto space, potentially as a way to launder influence or funds.\nOnline discussions, including on X, often amplify conspiracy theories - e.g., jokes that \"Epstein is Satoshi\" or that Bitcoin was \"hijacked\" via his funding.But credible sources emphasize no proof exists of Epstein knowing or being Nakamoto, and Bitcoin's decentralized nature makes direct control unlikely\n\nFor balance, note that Satoshi Nakamoto's identity has been speculated to be various individuals (e.g., Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright in older reports), but none involve Epstein. The Epstein ties seem more about opportunistic networking in emerging tech than a foundational role in Bitcoin's creation.","gravity_id":"372143601","id":40158,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T19:00:03.599Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T19:20:05.081Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-20T19:04:13.261Z","text_content":"$ETH exchange balances are dropping at a rapid pace.\nAvailable supply keeps shrinking, increasing the odds of a supply shock.\nI’m tracking these shifts closely as the next phase starts to take shape.\n#ETH  $ETH","gravity_id":"372141801","id":40168,"createdAt":"2025-12-20T19:10:02.136Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T19:30:05.926Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-20T19:02:20.349Z","text_content":"A civilization-scale opportunity isn’t about building the next big platform.

We apologize for the longer-than-expected maintenance period and thank everyone for their patience.  \n\nBridge Status\n• The bridge from the original chain to the ERC-20 (Ethereum) network is now open  \n\n• Users can freely move their tokens to Ethereum and utilize Uniswap \n\n• All bridge requests are processed within 24 hours of submission  \n\n❗️Important: Bridge approvals are temporarily manually reviewed as a security measure.  \n\nWhy Manual Approval?\nDuring the period when centralized exchange listings were closed, there was increased scam and phishing activity targeting community members attempting withdrawals and transfers. Unfortunately, some users were affected.  \n\nTo protect users:  \n• Manual verification was implemented to identify compromised or hacked funds  \n\n• This ensures affected users can recover and safely migrate their tokens in future.\n\n• These safeguards were introduced to protect the community, not to restrict access  \n\nSecurity and user protection remain our highest priority.  🔰\n\nExchange & Snapshot Clarification\n• Uniswap remains fully open and operational  \n\n• Trading can continue without interruption on decentralized markets  \n\n• An ERC-20 wallet balance snapshot was taken at the time of the official migration announcement  \n\n• No new purchases made after centralized exchange closure will be included in the upcoming migration  \n\nImportant Note\nThis announcement is not about migration itself. It is to raise awareness that decentralized exchange trading remains open, so no one should feel “stuck.” Our intention is not to keep anyone here against their will. Migration will only apply to those who choose to stay.\n\nThank you for your continued trust and patience during this transition.  \n\n📌 For more information, please refer to prior migration announcement and the company’s official legal statement as pinned. More details will follow in January.","gravity_id":"372155086","id":40668,"createdAt":"2025-12-21T03:10:03.271Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-21T04:00:06.276Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-21T03:25:45.093Z","text_content":"Walmart accepts $ETH in 16 days? 😅 More like they’re holding our dreams hostage until 2025! ⚡️🚀 #CryptoDrama #Ethereum #Walmart 🛒 Check the hype: https://aicryptocore.com/p/walmart-denies-ethereum-payment-rumors.webm ","gravity_id":"372154714","id":40677,"createdAt":"2025-12-21T03:30:02.647Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-21T05:30:05.540Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-21T03:25:45.078Z","text_content":"When Japan raises rates, we raise our crypto dreams! 🚀✨  \n\nInvestors in $ETH and $BTC, prepare for a wild ride!  \n\nOr just hold onto your hats, it’s all a meme! 😂🪙  \n\n👉 https://coinlineup.com/p/yi-lihua-crypto-trends-2025-positive-outlook.webm  \n\n#CryptoCulture #JapanRateHike #InvestSmart ","gravity_id":"372155193","id":40678,"createdAt":"2025-12-21T03:30:02.999Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-21T05:10:05.232Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-21T03:25:45.066Z","text_content":"When the U.S. is busy striking ISIS, but $BTC and $ETH are still mooning, you know geopolitics can't stop crypto! 🚀💰\n\nCheck it out: https://kanalcoin.com/p/us-strikes-isis-syria-operation.webm \n\n#CryptoCommunity #CryptoNews #HODL","gravity_id":"372154711","id":40679,"createdAt":"2025-12-21T03:30:03.352Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-21T05:10:05.591Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-21T03:24:36.994Z","text_content":"$Btc $ETH trading volume is rising again.\nThat’s a clear sign traders are stepping back in and liquidity is flowing back into the market.\nWhen price moves are supported by strong volume, they tend to be more reliable—not just noise.\nLow-activity conditions are fading.\nFocus is returning.
