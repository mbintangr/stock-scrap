Resistance is heavy around 90,000–91,000, while support sits near 85,000\n• ETH struggles to sustain rebounds as ETF-related selling pressure weighs on upside momentum\n• The surge in monthly exchange flows signals position rotation and risk adjustment rather than a clear directional trend, increasing volatility risk\n• ETF flows continue to cap short-term upside; a breakout requires clear flow improvement\n• Thin liquidity increases the risk of stop runs and exaggerated wicks even within the range\n• Short-term price action is “stop-and-go,” driven more by liquidations than trend formation\n• Buy-side bias appears intermittently, but rebounds fade quickly without volume\n• Conclusion: This is a wait-and-see market, not an aggressive risk-on environment\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOn-Chain & Technical Trends\n• Slowing growth in realized market cap signals weakening new capital inflows; recovery likely takes time\n• Surface-level consolidation masks underlying movement of older coins and ongoing distribution pressure\n• RSI is approaching a three-year low, leaving room for a bounce but keeping downside risk dominant until reversal signals appear\n• Liquidations are occurring on both sides, suggesting leverage cleanup rather than a new trend\n• ETH exchange outflows (custody and staking) may support the downside, but ETF pressure limits upside\n• Priority order: flows (ETF/exchange) > OI/funding > liquidation spikes > price\n• Strategy: minimal leverage, staggered entries, limit orders\n• Rebounds must be validated by volume and flow confirmation\n―――――――――――――――――――\nSentiment\n• Fear conditions persist, increasing the likelihood of two-sided stop hunts and volatile wicks\n• Aggressive short-term selling by U.S. participants can evolve into seller exhaustion and short-term bounces\n• Cooling retail interest reflects disengagement rather than outright panic; historically, this often precedes the next phase\n• Thin liquidity amplifies reactions to news and data, often followed by quick retracements\n• Strong tail-risk hedging raises the probability of sudden short squeezes; position sizing is critical\n• Key signals to watch: flow stabilization, liquidation cooldown, and sentiment basing\n• Conclusion: Focus on positioning and liquidation dynamics, not emotions\n• Today’s risk: downside continuation and sudden squeeze coexist\n―――――――――――――――――――\nU.S. Traditional Markets\n• Ongoing JPY weakness increases FX volatility spillover into risk assets\n• Continued unwind of yen carry trades pressures global leverage, limiting crypto’s independence\n• Markets are reacting more to liquidity provision than rate levels, especially in thin conditions\n• Long-term AI investment spending influences overall risk appetite\n• Crypto remains tightly linked to rates, FX, and options positioning\n• Year-end seasonality is less relevant than liquidity, leverage, and flows\n• Conclusion: A week prone to sharp, short-lived moves\n• Macro focus: sudden FX swings and liquidity events that can amplify intraday volatility\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOverall Assessment\nWeak demand quality and persistent ETF pressure justify a score of 26 (moderate downtrend). At the same time, fear conditions and thin liquidity raise the probability of sharp rebounds that fail to follow through.\nKey points today:\n1.Whether BTC and ETH ETF flows begin to stabilize\n2.Whether OI, funding, and liquidation activity cool down\n3.Whether FX moves and liquidity events trigger exaggerated “wick-driven” price action","gravity_id":"372174976","id":42131,"createdAt":"2025-12-21T22:50:02.332Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-21T23:30:06.135Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-21T22:58:14.746Z","text_content":"After aggressively calling 7,500, Tom Lee is now targeting $1,800.

This comes after December 2025’s Fusaka upgrade and is part of Ethereum’s long-term roadmap\n\n\nWhat Glamsterdam Is About\n\t•\tThe name combines “Amsterdam” (execution-layer changes) and “Gloas” (consensus-layer work) showing it’s a coordinated upgrade not just a small fix\n\t•\tThe main goal is to tackle MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)—when block producers reorder or filter transactions to make extra money often hurting regular users. Glamsterdam aims to make this process fairer and more transparent\n\n\nKey Features\n\t1.\tEnshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (ePBS): This separates block proposers and block builders at the protocol level. The idea is to reduce backroom deals and prevent a small group from controlling blocks\n\t2.\tBlock-level Access Lists (BALs): Blocks can declare in advance which parts of Ethereum they will interact with. This makes transactions more efficient lowers validator hardware needs and improves gas predictability for developers\n\n\nHow It Builds on Fusaka\n\t•\tFusaka focused on scaling like expanding rollup capacity and reducing node costs\n\t•\tGlamsterdam focuses on efficiency fairer validator dynamics and cleaner incentives for everyone on the network\n\n\nTimeline\n\t•\tThe exact features are still being debated\n\t•\tPublic testnets are expected in early 2026 followed by the mainnet launch once everything is ready\n\n\nWhy It Matters\nIf it works as planned Glamsterdam could make Ethereum more accessible to solo validators and create better conditions for users and builders.

On X, people scream “civil war!” without consequence. But on Polymarket? That same claim gets a 3% probability. Big difference.  What stood out to me is his idea of “Info Finance” — treating prediction markets as a new media layer. Not clicks. Not likes. Just capital-backed signals.   And with$ETH  at the center of many of these platforms, the implication is clear: truth has a price.  💯 Sure, ethical concerns exist, but let’s be real — traditional markets already profit off negative outcomes. Prediction markets just make bias more visible, not worse.  This is the kind of signal I pay attention to.  #Altcoin Season#  #ETHBlockchain","gravity_id":"372185653","id":42777,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T08:10:04.389Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-22T08:20:05.126Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-22T08:19:12.623Z","text_content":"🪙 $ETH  is looking calm but a bit cautious in the short term currently hovering around $2,975 with low volatility.

Approximately 20 minutes ago, this address acquired 13,412 ETH tokens valued at roughly $40.61 million at the time of the transaction. This latest buy continues their pattern of accumulating large quantities of ETH over recent periods, showing consistent interest from this major player.  Key Details of the Latest Purchase     — Amount acquired: 13,412 ETH — Approximate value: $40.61 million   — Time of transaction: Roughly 20 minutes ago   — Address behavior: Repeated large-scale accumulation over time   — Context: This move adds to their existing holdings and follows previous notable buys    Such substantial and repeated purchases often indicate strong conviction in ETH's long-term value proposition. Whales and institutions accumulating during different market phases typically do so because they anticipate future growth, network upgrades, or increased adoption across DeFi, NFTs, and layer-2 solutions. These actions can also reduce circulating supply on exchanges, potentially creating upward pressure on price if the trend continues.  The Bigger Picture     On-chain tracking of whale addresses like this one provides valuable insights into where smart money is positioning itself. For ETH, which remains the backbone of the decentralized finance ecosystem, ongoing accumulation by large holders reinforces confidence in its fundamentals. When multiple big players quietly stack tokens, it often signals that they see significant upside ahead, even amid market volatility.
