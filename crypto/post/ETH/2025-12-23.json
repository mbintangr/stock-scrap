This stronger-than-anticipated expansion is drawing renewed attention to the country’s unconventional strategy, where $BTC  continues to play a visible role alongside traditional economic reforms. Discussions around El Salvador’s $BTC  project will continue, with a strong focus on transparency and long-term sustainability. As global interest in sovereign crypto adoption grows, the performance of $BTC —and its comparison with assets like $ETH —remains central to debates on how digital assets can coexist with traditional financial systems.  ﻿Join us on Telegram: t.me/AlphaCryptoSignal  ﻿#CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#  #CMC Smart Quests#  #Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372217751","id":45010,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T08:10:05.207Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T08:40:06.605Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-23T08:25:38.780Z","text_content":"Tom Lee’s Bitmine added another 29,462 $ETH  (≈ $88.1M) via BitGo and Kraken, bringing its holdings to 3.37% of #Ethereum ’s total supply.","gravity_id":"372218454","id":45044,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T08:30:02.304Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T08:50:04.881Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-23T08:39:18.922Z","text_content":"$ETH just dipped below the key $3,000 level on the 4H chart, closing at $2,970.79. 🔴\nBears pushing hard after breaking that range, but RSI screaming oversold at 17 – bounce incoming or more pain?\nWatching closely into Christmas\n\n\n#ETH","gravity_id":"372218570","id":45060,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T08:40:03.596Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T09:00:07.202Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-23T08:38:34.775Z","text_content":"$ETH  TOAD, BNB","gravity_id":"372218566","id":45061,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T08:40:03.844Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T08:50:04.094Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-23T08:31:46.982Z","text_content":"$ETH IS CURRENTLY TARGETING THE 3,050 – 3,080 ZONE AS PRICE TRIES TO STABILIZE AFTER THE RECENT SELL-OFF.\n\n\nFrom the chart, $ETH has seen a clear impulsive drop from the upper range near 3,030–3,070, followed by a sharp sell-off that flushed liquidity below 2,960. After that sweep, price started to compress and form a small base around the 2,950–2,970 area. This kind of structure usually signals short-term exhaustion from sellers. If ETH continues to hold above the 2,950 support and builds acceptance above 2,980, a relief bounce toward 3,020 and potentially 3,050 remains possible. A long opportunity favors patience, waiting for a clean hold above intraday resistance rather than chasing the first green candles.\n\n\nOn the flip side, if ETH fails to reclaim 2,980–3,000 and shows rejection from this zone, sellers may regain control. The overall structure is still making lower highs, which keeps the short bias valid below key resistance. Any strong bearish candle back under 2,960 would open the door for continuation toward 2,920 and even 2,880. Short setups are safer if price confirms rejection near resistance rather than selling into support.\n\n\nShort outlook: $ETH is neutral-to-bearish in the short term. Holding above 2,950 favors a corrective bounce, while rejection below 3,000 keeps downside pressure intact.","gravity_id":"372218496","id":45062,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T08:40:04.223Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T08:50:04.500Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-23T08:47:50.958Z","text_content":"#ETHzilla  dumps 100% ETH reserves, they hold zero now.

The sale was used to repay all remaining loans on Aave, removing any liquidation risk.\n\nWith the debt cleared in one sweep, the whale withdrew the rest of its collateral — around 24,700 ETH, currently valued at $74.41 million — effectively shutting down the position for good.\n\nThis wasn’t a panic exit. It was the final step in a wider risk-reduction plan that began several days earlier. On December 18, the same wallet sold 20,599 ETH for roughly $59.1 million at prices near $2,869. At its peak, the position was exposed to more than $144 million worth of ETH.\n\nBlockchain data suggests the whale used a looping strategy, where ETH was deposited as collateral, borrowed against, and recycled to increase exposure. By selling during periods of price strength and repaying loans quickly, the trader likely locked in profits while avoiding forced liquidations.\n\nTransaction records from Arkham Intelligence show smooth swaps, fast repayments, and minimal friction — a clear example of how large players can now manage risk efficiently using DeFi tools.\n\nWhile the amount of ETH sold is small compared to daily trading volume, traders are watching closely. Whale exits often influence short-term sentiment, even when they don’t move the market directly.\n\nFor now, this looks less like a bearish signal and more like smart risk management.
