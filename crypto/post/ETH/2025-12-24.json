However, capitulation is cooling and liquidity backdrops (including stablecoin supply growth) suggest the downside is increasingly defended—so the score stands at 22 (mild downtrend).\nToday’s key watchpoints: (1) whether BTC spot ETF outflows start to slow (even deceleration changes the tone), (2) the defense strength of the 86K–88K zone, and (3) whether rotation into ETH/SOL remains persistent or flips back into BTC.","gravity_id":"372236863","id":46391,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T22:50:03.072Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T23:10:05.597Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-23T22:58:34.517Z","text_content":"LATEST: Ethereum treasury firm SharpLink reported $460 in $ETH  staking rewards last week, bringing cumulative rewards to 9,701 $ETH . ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372236916","id":46406,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T23:00:02.376Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T23:40:05.622Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-23T22:56:33.231Z","text_content":"Ethereum ($ETH ) Analysis  \r \r Ethereum’s price is at $2,951.57 with the major support at $2,928.61 and the major resistance at $2,986.81.

On December 24th, CryptoQuant analyst @AxelAdlerJr noted that the **Net Pressure Imbalance indicator**—which measures the buy-sell pressure ratio for short-term holders—has fallen to the 5th percentile of its three-year distribution. This level signals that short-term holders’ buy and sell pressure are currently in balance. The Net Pressure Imbalance is calculated as the difference between short-term holders’ weighted sell pressure and weighted buy pressure: a positive value means higher current sell pressure, while a negative value signals stronger buy pressure. As of now, the 24-hour moving average of the indicator stands at 4.79, with the asset priced at $87,324. The three-year median for the indicator is 73.17, meaning sell pressure typically dominates during growth phases. ﻿$ETH  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372249447","id":47255,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T11:10:03.790Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T11:30:04.040Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-24T11:16:45.056Z","text_content":"Binance Prepares for Ethereum Network Wallet Upkeep https://ift.tt/5l2rxFC","gravity_id":"372253402","id":47279,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T11:20:02.796Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T11:40:04.299Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-24T11:23:38.258Z","text_content":"ETH positioning on Hyperliquid is turning into a pressure cooker.
