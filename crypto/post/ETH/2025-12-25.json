Momentum is fragile — unless ETH can hold above resistance zones and confirm the breakout, the bias remains cautious. Traders should watch for rejection candles that could signal continuation of the broader bearish trend.  📌 Key Levels:  Current price: $2,949  Channel breakout zone: $2,950–$3,000  Support target: $2,373  Resistance zones: $3,200+  This is a decision-point setup — ETH is testing breakout, but confirmation is needed before calling trend reversal. Smart positioning means waiting for the market to prove strength.  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#  #Ethereum  #ETH  #Bullish","gravity_id":"372268248","id":48283,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T02:00:02.694Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T03:00:03.927Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-25T02:00:15.779Z","text_content":"$ETH No short selling today? :)","gravity_id":"372265697","id":48289,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T02:10:03.862Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T02:20:02.254Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-25T02:10:45.071Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nA certain new address 10x long 218.6 $BTC, short 5,294 $ETH, hedge profit about $50,000\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372268316","id":48300,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T02:20:02.086Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T03:50:04.185Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-25T02:19:45.037Z","text_content":"Santa’s checking his bag twice 🎅🎁\nBTC, ETH… and a little extra for the good traders 😉 Looks like Santa went long this year 💰\nMerry Christmas from XT 🎄✨\n\n#MerryChristmas #XT #Christmasgifts ","gravity_id":"372265788","id":48301,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T02:20:04.181Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T03:50:03.997Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-25T02:46:45.060Z","text_content":"Crypto News 📰 \n\n🔹Bitcoin trapped in $85K-$90K range all December, with year-end options expiry looming could spark a breakout soon! \n\n🔹 Market pullback continues: BTC dips below $88K, dragging altcoins & NFTs down amid holiday derisking & ETF outflows.

According to a report from CertiK Alert, the deposited funds were valued at approximately 280,000 US dollars based on prices at the time of the incident. This action took place shortly after the attacker successfully exploited a delegation contract related to EIP-7702.  The exploit originated from a delegation contract that had not been properly initialized. This vulnerability allowed an external party to take over ownership rights of the contract. In this case, the attacker gained full control over the delegation contract, granting them authority to manage the assets associated with it. Once ownership was transferred, all funds stored in the delegation address were immediately withdrawn by the attacker without resistance.  After withdrawing the funds, the attacker proceeded to deposit 95 ETH into Tornado Cash. The use of mixing services such as Tornado Cash is commonly intended to obscure on-chain transaction trails, making it more difficult to trace the subsequent movement of funds. This pattern frequently appears in smart contract exploitation cases, particularly when attackers attempt to distance stolen assets from their original source.  This incident once again highlights the critical importance of proper contract initialization, especially in newer mechanisms such as EIP-7702 delegation. Contracts that are not correctly initialized can expose severe ownership vulnerabilities, enabling asset takeovers without the need to breach more complex security systems. For developers and auditors, this case serves as a reminder that even small oversights during the deployment stage can have significant consequences for fund security within the blockchain network. #ETH  $ETH","gravity_id":"372268800","id":48368,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T04:20:02.904Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T04:30:04.047Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-25T04:04:46.014Z","text_content":"Hey Matrix Family,\n\n\nI’m watching this price action closely, and it’s a good moment to stay sharp. $ETH is currently consolidating after a short pullback, holding above its intraday support zone while buyers continue to defend the lower range.

We were grinding sideways for a while around 2,930, but the bulls finally showed some life.\nLook at the low from yesterday at 2,886. That held up like a champ. Now that we’ve reclaimed 2,950, I’m watching the 2,980 level closely. If we can’t flip that into support, this might just be a liquidity grab before another dip.\nVolume is picking up so it’s getting interesting. I’m staying patient here to see if this move has actual legs or if it's just a fakeout.\n\n#ETH","gravity_id":"372283075","id":49163,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T17:40:02.049Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T17:50:03.223Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-25T17:34:45.046Z","text_content":"🟣 #Ethereum is more than just a coin it’s the infrastructure of decentralised finance.\n\nCatch your moment with $ETH Futures.
