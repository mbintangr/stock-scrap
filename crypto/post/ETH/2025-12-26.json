But here’s the other side of the picture 👇  • Active addresses almost doubled in a week, jumping from ~496K to ~800K • Network usage is accelerating, not cooling off • Price stabilized after dipping near $2,850  Right now, ETH trades just below $2,955 in a corrective phase, with traders watching whether momentum can rebuild toward $3,390 if conditions improve. And while $BTC  still sets the macro tone, Ethereum’s on-chain activity suggests demand hasn’t disappeared - it’s just waiting for the next trigger.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #ETH   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372283724","id":49381,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T20:20:03.513Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T21:00:03.721Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-25T20:10:45.102Z","text_content":"Big Intents Swap Alert 💥\n\n9.0 $BTC (@Bitcoin) -> 9.94072385 $WBTC (@ethereum)\n\nTransaction link: https://explorer.near-intents.org/transactions/1LecYMyPa5XKQELeS7hGMcZ2xhqZxVxaTC\n\nPowered by @near_Intents.

In simple terms: less congestion, faster execution, and a network that can scale.  🛡️ Heze-Bogota tackles the other side - privacy and censorship resistance.

Price action shows controlled consolidation after recent bounces from $2,800–$2,850, trading below key moving averages on shorter timeframes with medium-term bearish pressure. Broader structure remains supportive, but indecision dominates—high volatility likely post-expiry as positions unwind.  A confirmed close above $3,000–$3,100 with strong volume would shift momentum bullish, targeting $3,200–$3,400. Rejection and break below $2,800–$2,850 could accelerate downside toward $2,700–$2,600. Key Levels:  Resistance zone: $3,000 (psychological) / $3,100 (max pain & expiry pivot) Breakout trigger: $3,100 (close above with volume) Upside targets: $3,200–$3,400 Support: $2,800–$2,850, deeper (~$2,600–$2,700)  Traders should monitor expiry flows and volume spikes near $3,000–$3,100 before positioning. Ethereum dominates DeFi, Layer-2 scaling, and institutional adoption via ETFs, with high staking yields and RWA tokenization fueling long-term demand. Despite 2025 rotations, network upgrades and TVL growth underpin resilience,watch for post-expiry institutional repositioning or macro catalysts to drive direction. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372295985","id":50171,"createdAt":"2025-12-26T08:50:03.089Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-26T09:00:03.621Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-26T08:46:45.069Z","text_content":"🚨 Breaking: EU wants your crypto data! 💸 Get ready for tax season, folks! 2026 is just around the corner.
