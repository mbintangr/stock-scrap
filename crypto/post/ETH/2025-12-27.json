As more ETH is locked in staking, circulating supply decreases while network security strengthens, creating structural scarcity that supports price appreciation over the medium to long term. At the same time, adoption across DeFi, Real World Assets (RWAs), and ETF-related products continues to accelerate, reinforcing Ethereum’s fundamental value.\nFrom a technical perspective, ETH remains in a constructive setup. The RSI is approaching oversold territory, while the MACD shows weakening downside momentum—signals that often precede a potential rebound. Funding rates are slightly negative, indicating the market is not overcrowded with leveraged long positions and that short-term downside pressure is limited. Recent whale activity points toward accumulation rather than distribution, consistent with a broader base-building phase.\nShort-term volatility cannot be ruled out, particularly as reduced liquid supply from increased staking may amplify price swings. However, key support zones offer opportunities for strategic entries. Compared to Bitcoin and Solana, Ethereum currently presents a compelling balance of strong network activity, institutional demand, and sustainable staking yields. Overall, ETH remains bullishly positioned, with attractive upside potential for investors who scale in gradually and take advantage of market dips.","gravity_id":"372325046","id":52083,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T09:30:03.010Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:00:04.113Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:24:02.288Z","text_content":"$BTC   $ETH\n\nGrowth in crypto adoption is picking up speed.\n\nhttps://t.me/+R2STcOeJKMxiMGFl\n\n0 → 170M in 6.5 years.\n170M → 300M in just 1+ year.\nThe community is growing faster than ever. 💛\n\n\n#btc #bitcoin #binance #growth #crypto","gravity_id":"372325022","id":52084,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T09:30:03.226Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T09:50:04.026Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:22:45.045Z","text_content":"🚨 LATEST: Tom Lee says asset tokenization could push ETH to $7K–$9K by early 2026. \nRead more:\n\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-tokenization-role-takes-focus-as-tom-lee-outlines-bullish-outlook","gravity_id":"372324598","id":52085,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T09:30:03.456Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T09:50:04.286Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:37:45.083Z","text_content":"Bitmine Starts ETH Staking With $219M Deposit Into PoS \n-   https://coinfomania.com/bitmine-starts-eth-staking-with-219m-deposit-into-pos/ ","gravity_id":"372325148","id":52095,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T09:40:02.400Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:00:03.690Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:49:32.075Z","text_content":"$ETH The downside is being absorbed, but our target at 84–85k remains unchanged.\n\n\nWe could see a short pump tomorrow, and into monday’s us session open, followed by the real movea dump toward our target.\n\n\nThis lines up perfectly with the fed minutes on tuesday and initial jobless claims on wednesday.\n\n\nI expect them to use the news to increase downside volatility/uncertenity, spread fear, and sweep liquidity.","gravity_id":"372324825","id":52110,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T09:50:02.959Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:20:03.980Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:44:54.033Z","text_content":"Tom Lee’s BitMine has staked 79,296  $ETH worth 232 million dollars\n\n• Staking adds yield on top of balance sheet exposure\n\n• Highlights growing corporate adoption of Ethereum\n\n• Long term upside narrative continues to strengthen\n\n#Ethereum   #BitMine","gravity_id":"372325196","id":52111,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T09:50:03.168Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:20:04.190Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:44:13.629Z","text_content":"$ETH why","gravity_id":"372325190","id":52112,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T09:50:03.377Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:00:03.492Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:58:45.234Z","text_content":"Why Wall Street Is Building on Ethereum Without Calling It Ethereum\n\nhttps://deythere.com/why-wall-street-is-building-on-ethereum-without-calling-it-ethereum/\n\n#BlackRockBUIDLEthereum #Ethereumsmartcontracts #GENIUSActstablecoins #WallStreetEthereumadoption #Crypto ","gravity_id":"372324917","id":52124,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T10:00:02.413Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:40:03.401Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:55:36.643Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $ETH","gravity_id":"372324884","id":52125,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T10:00:02.621Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:40:03.530Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:54:29.864Z","text_content":"🐋 NEW: A whale on Hyperliquid holding over $744M in long positions across $ETH , $BTC , and SOL is now sitting on more than $53M in unrealized losses as the market sees a sharp pullback. ﻿#ETH  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372325291","id":52126,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T10:00:02.836Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:40:03.653Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:49:45.141Z","text_content":"🚫📉 Philippines just blocked $BTC and $ETH access on Coinbase & Gemini!

If you’re just looking at the price, you’ll miss the bigger story. What’s happening with ETH now is all about timing, structure, and how the network’s evolving under the surface.  Right now, ETH is hanging around $2,930, bumping into the top of a descending channel. Every time sellers try to push it down and fail, buyers get a little bolder. You can feel the tension. It’s like the price is loading a spring.  What’s pushing all this? The 2026 Glamsterdam Upgrade is set to change the game for Ethereum’s scalability. It’s not just a tweak. After the Fusaka upgrade, which already bumped block gas limits to 60 million, Glamsterdam aims to take Layer 1 capacity all the way to 200 million. That’s huge. It’s not just another headline — it’s a shift in how the network works.  There’s more under the hood, too. Proposer-Builder Separation and Block-Level Access Lists are coming in, which means Ethereum can scale up without losing what matters most: decentralization. That’s what the long-term crowd really cares about.  If you’re trading on Binance, here’s where eyes are locked:  $3,000 – that’s the breakout zone  $3,400 – where the new trend proves itself  $4,200 – the last big wall before $5,000  And the market’s already leaning bullish. Long positions make up 72% of ETH derivatives open interest. That’s not just noise. That’s traders getting ready.  If ETH grabs $3,000 and holds it with real momentum, a run towards $5,000 isn’t just possible — the chart says it makes sense.  So, don’t mistake this quiet stretch for indecision.
