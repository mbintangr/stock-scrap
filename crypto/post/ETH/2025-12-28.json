Trading near $2,900 and down YoY, it looks disconnected from reality. But under the surface, Ethereum’s fundamentals are quietly getting stronger - and some think the real move starts in 2026.  A big reason? Bitcoin still sets the cycle. As long as $BTC  dictates broader risk conditions, ETH breakouts can stay delayed. That doesn’t stop capital from building inside the ecosystem.  Here’s what’s driving the long-term setup 👇 • Stablecoin market expected to grow from ~$308B → $500B • Over half of stablecoin activity already runs on Ethereum • Tokenized RWAs projected to reach ~$300B by 2026  Institutions are moving from pilots to production.
