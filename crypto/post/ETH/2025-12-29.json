Abyssal Losses: For the weaker projects, corrections have reached a staggering -70% to -99%. These are depletion levels rarely seen outside the darkest phases of previous bear markets.  A Selective Purge: Unlike previous cycles where \"a rising tide lifts all boats,\" 2025 is punishing lack of utility and token inflation with extreme prejudice.

This event will become a powerful driver of growth and development, not only for the ULTIMA coin, but for the entire ecosystem as well.\n\nAfter the halving, only 6 ULTIMA coins will be entering the market, significantly increasing scarcity and laying the foundation for future growth. \n\nLimited supply combined with a clear development strategy is making the coin increasingly in demand among crypto enthusiasts worldwide.\nNow is the perfect time to take action and secure as many ULTIMA as possible! 🚀\n\n▶️ IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT DELEGATING KEY RESOURCES\nStarting December 27, 2025, the resource delegation feature in SMART Wallet and UWallet has been completely disabled, including ULTIMA delegation in UWallet.\n\nThis decision is related to stricter international regulatory requirements in many countries, especially across Europe. Delegating key resources between users while receiving rewards may be considered a regulatory violation.\n\nThis is an important step toward technological stability and strengthening the ULTIMA rate ahead of the third halving. Thank you for your understanding!\n\n▶️ UTRADING BOTS DELIVER THE BEST RETURNS IN 2025!\nBy the end of 2025, returns across different asset classes look like this: silver (+130%), gold (+65%), Nasdaq (+20%), S&P 500 (+16%), BTC (–6%), ETH (–12%), altcoins (–42%).\n\nAs a result, more and more users are choosing an algorithmic approach, where results are driven not by years of waiting, but by strategy discipline and the bot’s consistent performance.

A clean break above this could open the doors for higher levels (towards $3,650).\n​Risk Management: This bullish outlook remains valid as long as ETH holds above the critical $2,600–$2,700 support floor. A daily close below this zone would invalidate the current setup.\n​Summary: We are looking for a continuation toward the upper range.
