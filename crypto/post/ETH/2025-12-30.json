They're trying to show you strength, but it's all smoke and mirrors. The economy is on the verge of a recession and a bubble. They desperately need your money because they are sitting on a time bomb.  Don't get fooled by the crypto clowns. Ethereum is not going to recover anytime soon; it's going to keep falling. Furthermore, the massive speculative bubble generated by AI is about to burst, and its collapse will trigger widespread panic among investors, leading to unemployment, spiraling inflation, and a deep recession.  At the same time, generational interest in cryptocurrencies is fading substantially. The crypto clowns and their entire circus will be hit by a tsunami of selling pressure that will annihilate their value. The crypto ice age is at our doorstep.","gravity_id":"372405287","id":56722,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T05:20:03.152Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T05:40:03.917Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-30T05:31:02.589Z","text_content":"$ETH  #Ethereum  remains the second‑largest blockchain, now fully proof‑of‑stake after the Merge, cutting energy use by over 99%.

Monero was launched in 2014, and its goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. \n\n* @Zcash (ZEC) - Zcash is a decentralized cryptocurrency focused on privacy and anonymity.\n\n* @poseidoncash - open-source privacy protocol for shielded transactions.\n\n* @Arcium - Tokens like Arcium’s C-SPL will let businesses send crypto without revealing balances or transaction details.\n\n* @horizenglobal - L3 appchain on Base, focused on providing scalable privacy solutions for dApps\n\n* @tenprotocol - Ethereum L2 with a privacy-first, encrypted execution environment for smart contracts.\n\nAs a developer this is a sign to become a part of this privacy Gold rush while first mover advantage still exists.\n\nImagine,\n\n- Private prediction market \n- Encrptyed Ai analytic tools: Use Ai without exposing your Data\n- Anonymous B2B payments \n\nEarly adopters will make the most of the future of privacy\n\n=> So as an individual how do i stay private?\n\n* Limit CEX Accounts use: Move to self-custody wallets like Phantom or Solflare.\n\n * Hold Privacy Coins: Keep a small bag of Monero (XMR) or Zcash (ZEC).\n\n*  Use DEXs: Trade on decentralized exchanges like Jupiter or perp DEX .\n\n * Run Your Own Node: Or use trusted remote nodes for Monero.\n\n * Use TOR/I2P: Mask your IP address when making transactions.\n\n * Decoy Wallets: Create fake wallets to throw off trackers.\n\n* Churning: Move funds between wallets to confuse analytics.\n\n* Relocate Assets: Move to privacy-friendly jurisdictions like Switzerland or Singapore.\n\nListen, Privacy is not just about hiding or staying anonymous. it’s about controlling your data. \n\nDon’t forget, \"Whoever controls the data, controls the future.\" \n\nIn 2026, you’ll have the tools to protect your financial data, your identity, and your freedom.\nWhether you’re a crypto native or a regular internet user, privacy matters to you.\n\nDon’t wait until it’s too late 🤌🏻","gravity_id":"372410931","id":57019,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T10:20:02.583Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T10:30:02.986Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-30T10:16:45.059Z","text_content":"According to Leon Waidmann (@LeonWaidmann),\nEthereum mainnet transactions have hit a new all-time high again 📈\n・Mainnet transaction count is at cycle highs\n・A stable range of 1.5M–2.0M+ daily transactions\n・Activity is accelerating into year-end\n・No speculative bubble is required\nWe haven’t seen such a wide gap between fundamentals and price in a long time.","gravity_id":"372414077","id":57020,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T10:20:02.830Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T10:30:03.142Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-30T10:07:45.111Z","text_content":"Crypto Market Daily Sentiment Overview | 30 Dec by @OrioleInsights\n\n💡 Key Market Indicators\n• Market Sentiment: 🐂 Bullish 52% | 🐻 Bearish 48%\n• Oriole Fear&Greed Index: 🟡 Neutral 51.6\n• Total Market Cap: $3.05T (-1.45%)\n• $BTC Price: $87,747 (-1.87%)\n• #BTC Dominance: 57.4% (-0.42%)\n\nTrending Projects on @OrioleInsights\n🥇@Bitcoin $BTC: 359 Predictions | 42,618 ORI\n🥈@Ethereum $ETH: 314 Predictions | 27,748 ORI\n🥉@Binance $BNB: 289 Predictions | 21,086 ORI\n\n📈 TOP #Bullish Projects\n$BTC $BNB $POL $ETH $AVAX $ENSO $ZEC\n\n📉 TOP #Bearish Projects\n$BB $PROM $MANTA $ANON $BABYDOGE $BELIEVE $GT\n\n🫂 User Activity Highlights\nA total of 79,084 predictors have already made 77,297 predictions.\n\nMake predictions on #OrioleInsights to prove your expertise and publicly boost your Reputation!\n👉 https://t.co/UydPdFMQOR","gravity_id":"372413023","id":57021,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T10:20:03.081Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T10:30:03.286Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-30T10:04:03.276Z","text_content":"Spot XRP ETFs maintain 29-day inflow streak despite turbulent December US-listed XRP ETFs continued to draw steady inflows through December, even as Bitcoin and Ether funds posted sharp monthly outflows.  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  $BTC  $ETH","gravity_id":"372410862","id":57022,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T10:20:03.227Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T10:30:03.483Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-30T10:03:39.316Z","text_content":"The SEC Chairman says Ethereum is now a \"critical component\" of cryptocurrency.

The Glamsterdam upgrade is scheduled for the first half of 2026\n\n2. Hegota is planned for late 2026, continuing the new rapid-release cadence\n\n3.   $ETH is moving from infrequent mega-upgrades to smaller, regular improvements\n\n4.

MACD is crossing into positive territory, suggesting early bullish momentum, though volume remains subdued.   💰 Liquidity clusters sit above $3160 and below $2800 — a breakout on either side likely brings follow-through.  A close above $3180 could open up the $3400–$3600 range. If sellers regain control and we lose $2800, look for retests near $2500–$2600, where demand previously stepped in.
