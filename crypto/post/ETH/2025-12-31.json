The upcoming Super App extends beyond Web3 into personal empowerment, relationships, and career growth. $MANTA stakers can already start earning $GUA rewards, SUPERFORTUNE’s native token. \nTry it out: https://t.co/B84eyhmbYq\n\n🦝 @junkfun_ launched as Web3’s first meme recycler. Junk your memecoins and NFTs to redeem locked $SOL, open chests, and participate in the weekly lottery to win rewards. Nearly 400 $SOL rewarded with 127k+ wallets participating in the lotteries. Give it a try: https://t.co/PGjEivubVs\n⚡ Fast Finality and Liquid Staking\n\nOctober marked a milestone with $MANTA staking and the completion of Phase 1 for Fast Finality on Manta Pacific through @symbioticfi’s restaking protocol.\n\nLiquid staking arrived via @Bifrost. $vMANTA is now available on both Bifrost and Ethereum with 20.16% staking APY and flexible redemption.\n\nhttps://t.co/pENrby7WzN\n\nhttps://t.co/kQtoVCyxQZ\n🌏 Manta Worldwide\n\nYou probably saw Manta in every corner of the world in 2025. From ETH Denver to Token2049 in Dubai and Singapore, we got a chance to connect with builders and communities across continents.\n\nAnd our regional presence deepened through Web3 events like Korea Blockchain Week, Taiwan Blockchain Week, Indonesia Hacker House, GMVN Vietnam, and Innovate25 Nigeria. We saw our ties strengthening with the BNB Chain ecosystem at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai.\n🛠️ Infrastructure Evolution\n\nManta Pacific’s fundamentals remained strong: Q1 saw 106% TVL growth, Q2 brought 58% address growth, and our CeDeFi offerings peaked at $131M TVL while generating healthy protocol revenue.\n\nUp until Q4, our Gas Gain program rewarded the top 400 most active monthly users by returning 50% of their $MANTA spent in gas fees, showing our commitment to the Manta community.\n\nFull Messari report here: https://t.co/doC30RRxwq\n🤝 Strategic Partnerships\n\nThis year brought lots of exciting integrations and collaborations with multiple leading projects in the Web3 space.\n\n▶️ We teamed up with @babylonlabs_io to bring Bitcoin’s security to our dual-layer Fast Finality architecture.\n\n▶️ @graphprotocol integration brought Manta Pacific to Subgraph Studio, granting developers easy and reliable access to onchain data for building next-level dApps.\n\n▶️ @ProjectZeroIO unlocked powerful real-time smart contract capabilities, AI agents powered by live multi0chain insights, dynamic NFTs responding to user behaviour, and cross-chain fraud detection for dApp builders.\n\n▶️ @StargateFinance launched a new $ETH pool on Manta Pacific, tapping into unified liquidity across 40+ chains. Seamlessly bridge $ETH, mTokens, and LSTs between Manta Pacific and Ethereum with enhanced cross-chain interoperability.\n\n▶️ We partnered with @wintermute_t for a liquidity arrangement of 7.5M $MANTA tokens to support healthy market operations.\n🎉 2025 proved that infrastructure is indeed important, but fun, compelling applications are what’s needed drive adoption further. As we step into 2026, Manta Labs continues to build products that onboard new users onchain.\n\nA big thank you to our community that makes all the innovation possible. The era of viral applications has only just begun.\n\nManta Never Stops! 🚀","gravity_id":"372442633","id":59051,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T12:40:03.430Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T12:50:04.115Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-31T12:16:45.132Z","text_content":"Happy new year!\n\nMy gift for the community is buy $ETH below 3k$ and thank me later\n\nCheers 🥂","gravity_id":"372441638","id":59052,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T12:40:03.611Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T12:50:04.277Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-31T12:16:45.056Z","text_content":"🟡 @Lighter_xyz $LIT has been listed on @OrioleInsights for price movement predictions!\n\n📜 About #Lighter\nLighter is a perpetual-trading protocol built on @Ethereum.

It reminded traders how quickly forced selling can flip a strong trend in a market still driven by derivatives.\nSpot BTC ETFs were the new structural buyer. \n\nThey attracted more than $25B in net inflows, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, pulling demand away from offshore leverage and into regulated products that many institutions can actually use.\nOn chain, Ethereum staking climbed to tens of millions of ETH and stablecoins processed multi trillion monthly volumes, confirming their role as core settlement rails. \n\nDeFi TVL peaked mid year before fading into the close as yields narrowed.\nAt the speculative edge, memecoin volumes fell back after an intense early year phase, while real world asset tokenisation kept expanding, bringing credit, treasuries and alternative assets into crypto infrastructure.\nPolicy shifted too, with a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve announced and other jurisdictions advancing market structure and stablecoin rules. \n\nIn short, 2025 built the rails. 2026 is about how far new liquidity and better access reprice BTC and the wider market.","gravity_id":"372439727","id":59158,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T13:40:03.027Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T14:00:04.313Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-31T13:33:46.431Z","text_content":"$ETH It appears its jackhammer time to break through $3000...HNY!!","gravity_id":"372440682","id":59159,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T13:40:03.295Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T13:50:03.194Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-31T13:32:44.019Z","text_content":"I struggled in the early stages of the Bitget Trading Club Championship because my strategies weren’t clear enough, and that uncertainty cost me consistency.

He emphasized that $BTC  was designed to be a permissionless, peer-to-peer payment system, giving users full control over their money without relying on third parties. With $BTC , transactions can move anywhere at the speed of light, free from traditional banking restrictions. Unlike illiquid or inflating assets, Bitcoin offers financial sovereignty, allowing users to access and transfer their funds anytime, anywhere. 💡 Takeaway: The focus on $BTC  as a fast, decentralized payment system reminds us why Bitcoin remains pivotal in the crypto ecosystem, alongside other key coins like $ETH  and $BTC  itself.  ﻿Join us on Telegram: t.me/AlphaCryptoSignal  ﻿#CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#  #CMC Smart Quests#  #Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372446465","id":59415,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T16:00:03.523Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T16:40:04.274Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-31T15:52:03.397Z","text_content":"Crypto Daily Update: $ETH   | 31 December 2025  ETH is facing a rejection marked by a long upper wick.

But this is where it gets interesting. Some analysts think Ethereum may be closer to a bounce than most expect. And yes, the bigger mood still follows $BTC .  Price is holding up 📊  $ETH   is back above $3,000 and keeps respecting a rising support line that’s been there for months. On recent dips, we’re seeing buyers step in - long-term holders and firms like BitMine, not panic sellers.  Something is quietly changing  Momentum tools are starting to improve. RSI is moving up, MACD is turning higher. Nothing explosive yet - just early signs that selling pressure may be easing.  Takeaway  If this structure holds, a push toward $4K stays possible. If it breaks, the market likely looks down toward the $2.5K area instead.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #ETH  #ETH 2#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372446557","id":59446,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T16:20:02.604Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T16:50:04.720Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-31T16:20:50.438Z","text_content":"BREAKING: 💰 Crypto market gets a boost as the Fed injects $74B into the economy! $BTC  & $ETH  ETFs see inflows. #Crypto  #Bitcoin  #Ethereum  #MarketAnalysis  #Finance","gravity_id":"372446596","id":59462,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T16:30:02.740Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T16:50:03.928Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-31T16:20:03.309Z","text_content":"$ETH #ETH still able for the recovery🔥 \n\nOnce accumulation below the Resistance Confluence of EMAs is confirmed I am waiting for $4k🚀\n\n#Ethereum  $ETH","gravity_id":"372444975","id":59463,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T16:30:03.019Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T16:50:04.187Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2025-12-31T16:38:14.727Z","text_content":"Ethereum saw a record level of developer activity in Q4.\n\n\nToken Terminal data shows 8.7 million smart contracts were deployed on $ETH during the quarter, an all-time high.
