BTC/ETH have reclaimed key levels and sentiment is improving from fear, so the “rebound core” is forming. However, ETF flows remain unstable and thin liquidity means sharp pushbacks are still likely even during rallies.\nToday’s key watchlist: (1) Can BTC hold the 90k zone (if yes, short-covering can extend) (2) Do ETF flows show a sustained turn (3) OI and leverage skew (liquidation risk) (4) Does Fear & Greed continue improving into the 30s+ (5) Does ETH ESR keep rising (sell/hedge pressure) or start rolling over (absorption winning).","gravity_id":"372499872","id":63092,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T20:40:03.288Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T21:00:05.214Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-02T20:24:43.967Z","text_content":"$ETH JUST HIT A NEW YEARLY HIGH","gravity_id":"372500861","id":63093,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T20:40:03.574Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T20:50:04.003Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-02T20:22:45.056Z","text_content":"It's a frog's world; we are just living in it 🐸\n\n$PEEZY $PEPE $ETH ","gravity_id":"372501452","id":63094,"createdAt":"2026-01-02T20:40:03.858Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-02T20:50:04.181Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-02T20:21:04.509Z","text_content":"$ETH  Ethereum has broken above the corrective price channel's upper boundary line.

Over the past few months, the Trading Club Championship by Bitget has helped me take things further. I’ve grown my BGB stack to over 100, all through spot trading and leaderboard rewards, no purchases, just steady effort.    Now that Phase 24 is live, it’s another chance to stay locked in and keep the momentum going. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372524795","id":64495,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T16:50:03.182Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T17:10:04.619Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-03T16:37:08.689Z","text_content":"BitMine continues its staking streak.   \r \r Today alone, BitMine staked $259,000,000 in $ETH  💎   \r That brings their total Ethereum staked to a massive $1.62 BILLION.   \r \r Smart money isn’t trading noise — it’s locking in conviction.\r \r #ETHUSDT   long-term energy is getting louder every day 🚀  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372525541","id":64497,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T16:50:03.675Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T17:00:04.726Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-03T16:35:31.306Z","text_content":"🔥 Major squeeze in play: Over 73% of all liquidations in the past 24 hours came from short positions a clear sign of aggressive upside pressure catching bears off guard. $BTC  $ETH  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #ETH","gravity_id":"372526398","id":64498,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T16:50:03.865Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T17:00:05.025Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-03T16:34:33.536Z","text_content":"$ETH passage of time will show everything and prove that BALLTZE is the best memecoin and will grow the most in Bullrun. 💥","gravity_id":"372526394","id":64499,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T16:50:04.170Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T17:00:05.321Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-03T16:32:47.234Z","text_content":"$ETH passage of time will show everything and prove that BALLTZE is the best memecoin and will grow the most in Bullrun. 💥","gravity_id":"372523728","id":64500,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T16:50:04.463Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T16:50:04.463Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-03T16:28:33.120Z","text_content":"Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs record $645.8 million in inflows in a single day.\n\nBoth Bitcoin spot ETFs and Ethereum spot ETFs recorded large inflows, with the largest ones coming from BTC.\n\n $BTC spot ETFs recorded $471.30 million in inflows, while  $ETH spot ETFs recorded $174.50 million in inflows.\n\n#Bitcoin #Ethereum","gravity_id":"372524720","id":64501,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T16:50:04.759Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T16:50:04.759Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-03T16:58:23.333Z","text_content":"BREAKING: 🇺🇸 Tom Lee's BitMine has staked 82,560 #ETH worth $260 million today.\n\nIn just a week, they have staked $1.7 billion worth of Ethereum  $ETH","gravity_id":"372525644","id":64534,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T17:00:02.890Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T17:20:05.245Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-03T16:52:46.571Z","text_content":"Tom Lee’s Bitmine Staked Another 82,560 $ETH  (about $259M) Just 4 Hours ago.

Vitalik is right: faster blocks and better UX are table stakes. The real question is whether Ethereum can scale without sacrificing decentralization. 2025 laid strong groundwork — improved throughput, more reliable infra, lower barriers to running nodes. But tech progress alone isn’t success.  Chasing short-term narratives — meme politics, artificial activity, hype-driven metas — risks turning $ETH   into just another attention machine. Its edge is different: being a “world computer” where apps are censorship-resistant, permissionless, and survive even if their creators walk away.  The real test now isn’t speed — it’s the walkaway test. If Ethereum can deliver scalable, decentralized apps end-to-end (not just at L1, but at the app layer), it proves its long-term relevance. Otherwise, upgrades are just noise.  #ETHBlockchain  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372523995","id":64604,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T17:40:02.630Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T17:50:02.617Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-03T17:42:12.555Z","text_content":"A clean break above $BTC   this minor resistance may be the first sign of a larger range breakout.
