I zoomed out on the previous chart and this is what we have, there is plenty of room for this trading pair to wiggle around.\n\nWe can see a resistance level flipped support and now a bullish continuation. For the bullish continuation to be confirmed, ETHBTC needs to break above the 9-Dec high at 0.03687. Such an event would give us full confirmation and this is likely to happen in the coming days.\n\nThe main target is 0.05092 for the current move as this is the 1.618 Fib. extension level based on the size of the correction between August and November 2025. But this is truly a short-term target. The same resistance but based on a broader move, as an extension of the wave from September 2022 through April 2025, sits at 0.05963, the 0.618 Fib. extension level. This would be mid-way through the full cycle—a mid-term target.\n\nA true and final target rests much higher, we are talking about 0.12744, that's the full potential for the bullish move that started in April 2025. Just to keep the bigger picture in mind.\n\nFrom current price, the last and final target amounts to 269% growth potential, more than 1,300% with 5X. Here you have the trade-numbers for the smaller wave but still pretty good as the target can be achieved short-term.\n\nThank you for reading.

BTC has reclaimed the $90,000 level, and while the move is liquidation-driven, the market is increasingly demonstrating an ability to hold rather than sell. Negative funding and skeptical sentiment suggest conditions are forming for a more durable rebound, though thin liquidity means advances are unlikely to be smooth.\nKey points to watch today:\n1. Whether BTC can hold above $90K (supportive for continued short covering)\n2. Sustainability of early-January ETF inflows\n3. Open interest and leverage imbalances (liquidation risk)\n4.

While $ETH  is still well below its old highs, activity across the network is picking up - the kind of thing we usually see when patient money starts stepping in.  🔹 Ethereum transactions are back above 2021 NFT-boom levels, which tells us people are actually using the network again.  🔹 Futures open interest is rising too, meaning traders are putting fresh capital to work, not just reacting emotionally.  Big picture? Sellers are backing off, institutions are getting more comfortable, and accumulation is slowly replacing panic. This doesn’t feel like a quick bounce - it feels like the market quietly getting back on its feet.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #ETH  #ETHBlockchain   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372529608","id":64872,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T21:00:02.252Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T22:10:04.596Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-03T21:16:57.639Z","text_content":"$ETH ⚠️ TODAY: BTC & ETH options totaling $2.2B are set to expire, a key event that could drive volatility and sharp intraday moves. #CryptoDerivatives #BTC #ETH","gravity_id":"372527823","id":64884,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T21:20:02.151Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T22:20:04.676Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-03T21:12:44.161Z","text_content":"SharpLink Has Acquired 863K ETH -Targets Another ~6 Million  $ETH\n\nWhile Most Focus On Short-Term Price Action, SharpLink Gaming Is Executing A Long-Term Plan To Acquire 5% Of Ethereum's Circulating Supply: Now 14.3% Complete.\n\nAccumulation Snapshot:\n✅ 863,021 ETH On Balance Sheet ($2.68B)\n✅ 0.71% Of Total ETH Supply\n✅ +8,780 #Ethereum Generated Via Yield\n✅ Unrealized P&L: -$368.9M","gravity_id":"372528850","id":64885,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T21:20:02.450Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T22:10:04.300Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-03T21:27:44.889Z","text_content":"Ethereum ($ETH ) Analysis  \r \r Ethereum’s current price is at $3,120 with the major support at $3,908 and the major resistance at $3,151.

🤑 Ethereum headed towards $5,000 · Massive bullish bias based on weekly timeframe\n\n#Ethereum #ETH #ETHUSDT\n\nThere is so much usual information on this chart that is hard to know where to start. A minimum price of $5,000 is Ethereum's next target. This is very easy to see when considering the overall chart structure. Ethereum loves to produce double-tops.\n\nWe have a long-term double top, 2025 vs 2021. There was also a triple-top in 2024: March, May and December.\n\nThe low from November last year is a very strong higher low compared to the start of the bullish wave, April 2025. This same low is also a higher low compared to June 2025, so the third in a sequence. Higher lows lead to higher highs.\n\nThis most basic signal is what opens $5,000 as the next target, but this resistance isn't likely to be the end. Let's see what else the chart is saying.\n\nThe action is now happening right above the 0.618 Fib. extension level shown on the chart. This is a very important level. It matches EMA89 weekly.\n\nWhenever ETHUSDT trades above EMA89, the market tends to become extremely bullish. EMA89 is very significant because prices went below this level for several weeks. Support was being challenged and this week ETH is moving above for the first time since the breakdown in November. EMA144 is the longer moving average that worked as support.\n\nNow we have both EMA89 and EMA144 working as support coupled with the 0.618 Fib. extension ($3,068). The week closes tomorrow so this will be a major development and the start of bullish momentum as the recovery and bullish continuation takes place.\n\nIf you are active with our ETHUSDT 15X LONG, there are two major resistance zones to consider: (1) Right around $4,050 and (2) $5,000. It is very likely that Ether will continue growing after meeting these levels but a stop, a retrace, can happen at $4,050 and a correction at $5,000 and only afterward we get additional growth.\n\n\n\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nNamaste.","gravity_id":"372540369","id":65500,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T08:40:02.176Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T09:30:14.513Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-04T08:36:25.777Z","text_content":"[{\"sourceId\":\"695a25f6861d0924842041e3\",\"tldr\":\"Ethereum staking sees soaring institutional interest with 35.5M ETH staked, driving network activity and validator queue delays.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/6958df6eb0a1903a557d4b76\",\"relevantWord\":\"institutional interest\",\"score\":\"8.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"695a25ee861d0924842041d0\",\"tldr\":\"Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade boosts security, scalability, and bridges Web2 and Web3 with biometric transaction signing.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/69595247ca733546c4866fa0\",\"relevantWord\":\"Fusaka upgrade\",\"score\":\"8.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"695a25ef861d0924842041d1\",\"tldr\":\"Ethereum achieves record 2.2 million daily transactions, driven by infrastructure use without congestion or high fees.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/69593f873ea2614150b3564c\",\"relevantWord\":\"record 2.2 million daily transactions\",\"score\":\"8.0\"}]","gravity_id":"372541058","id":65501,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T08:40:02.472Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T09:30:14.814Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-04T08:48:39.423Z","text_content":"JUST IN : 💰 Strategic $ETH Reserve Entities and  Reserves now hold 10.74% of the total $ETH supply worth $40.4B.\n\n#Ethereum #CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#","gravity_id":"372540652","id":65510,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T08:50:02.681Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T09:30:14.208Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-04T08:55:47.447Z","text_content":"$ETH scams are still hoping to make money white retail poor people's money..  after so long this tricks won't work anymore .\n\nPeople stop investing in this trash.","gravity_id":"372540705","id":65520,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T09:00:05.200Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T09:40:40.835Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-04T08:55:44.578Z","text_content":"$ETH  🔵 Ethereum (ETH)  ETH’s move fits a familiar pattern: consolidation → volatility release → continuation.

What used to last months now lasts weeks - sometimes days. AI, memes, L2s, infra - attention jumps constantly.  This forces traders to adapt. Long lockups and complex strategies lose relevance. Flexibility wins. The ability to exit, rotate, and re-enter quickly is now more valuable than catching the exact bottom.  That’s why cross-ecosystem movement is exploding. Traders increasingly use TON as a neutral zone between narratives. STONfi becomes useful not because of hype, but because it enables fast transitions when momentum shifts.

Flat markets destroy experienced traders who get impatient. When price doesn’t move, people force trades, overtrade, and lose discipline.  Professionals do the opposite. During flat periods, they reduce exposure, optimize execution, and prepare infrastructure. They test routes, measure slippage, and choose environments where things won’t break once volatility returns.  This is why activity quietly builds on chains like TON during boring market phases. Traders position themselves where execution remains stable. STONfi often becomes part of that preparation process - a place to rebalance calmly instead of rushing during chaos.

They choose ecosystems where they can unwind positions without delays or unexpected costs. Predictability beats innovation here.  TON increasingly serves this role.
