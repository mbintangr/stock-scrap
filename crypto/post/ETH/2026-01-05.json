However, similar breakout structures often resolve as temporary moves rather than sustained trends.   Price is now testing the 0.618 Fibonacci resistance, which also aligns with daily resistance near $3,200.  \r \r If Ethereum fails to reclaim and hold above this resistance zone, it increases the probability of a false breakout. In that scenario, price could rotate lower toward daily support around $2,800, maintaining the broader corrective structure.","gravity_id":"372565675","id":66872,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T04:00:02.697Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T04:50:05.283Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-05T03:50:47.269Z","text_content":"JUST IN: Walmart will now accept Ethereum $ETH  payments in store. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372564928","id":66873,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T04:00:03.013Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T04:30:05.340Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-05T03:49:45.091Z","text_content":"📊 XT Daily Market Highlights | January 5\n\n🟢 Crypto market cap: $3.16 T (+1.75%）\n📈 BTC Dominance: 58.6%(+1.87%）\n🔸 BTC ETF: +$471M\n🔸 ETH ETF: +$174M\n🔸 Fear & Greed Index: 42\n📉 Futures Long/Short Ratio: 1.11\n🔸 Top Gainer: $CARDS +141.7% $BITBEDR +138.6% $KABUTO +111.08% $HOSICO +108.74%\n\n#XT #CryptoNews","gravity_id":"372564918","id":66875,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T04:00:03.637Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T04:10:07.548Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-05T04:04:45.038Z","text_content":"⚡️ KIYOSAKI: “DO NOT SAVE MONEY.
