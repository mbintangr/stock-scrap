On-chain demand remains the main ceiling for a clean breakout, while accumulation and policy/infrastructure progress continue to support the downside—hence a neutral, “verification” score today.\nWhat to watch today (concise):\n ・ETF flow follow-through: does it turn back positive, or extend the pause?\n ・Open interest: is the build healthy, or tipping into leverage-driven overheating?\n ・BTC’s ability to hold the low-$91K to ~$90K zone (absorption quality)\n ・Sentiment drift: does Fear & Greed slide back into deeper fear, or stabilize toward neutral?","gravity_id":"372661174","id":72877,"createdAt":"2026-01-07T22:00:02.593Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-07T23:30:05.982Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-07T21:51:39.434Z","text_content":"Morgan Stanley Files for  $ETH ETF Following  $BTC & SOL\n\nMorgan Stanley has officially filed an S-1 registration for an Ethereum ETF, just a day after submitting filings for Bitcoin and Solana ETFs.

Buterin argues that reducing latency is constrained by factors like the speed of light and decentralization. Instead, Ethereum should focus on building more lanes to accommodate more traffic (transactions) without compromising security or decentralization.  He further explains that with existing technologies like PeerDAS and ZKPs, Ethereum could be scaled thousands of times.

For durability I've always gravitated toward onchain projects, of which there are many shades:\n\n• Semi-onchain — some metadata is stored onchain, but not all\n\n• Hashed onchain — NFT contracts host a cryptographic hash that permanently references offchain data\n\n• Hybrid onchain — a project deploys a separate onchain collection to archive an earlier offchain collection\n\n• Fully onchain — all the data needed to display an NFT lives within the collection's smart contract\n\n• Inchain — NFT visuals are generated live by fully onchain code at render time rather than stored as files\n\nEach method has pros and cons. Yet broadly speaking, putting things onchain is costlier than offchain storage and requires more smart contract expertise.\n\nAs such, offchain storage, where only NFT tokens live onchain while their metadata is hosted on external platforms like IPFS or private servers, is the status quo for most NFT collections from the past 5 years.\nThe problem is that IPFS pinning often wanes with time, and many startups go bust and shutter their private servers. In these cases, only the tokens remain as worthless remnants that can no longer display their imagery.\n\nThere are plenty examples of lost NFTs from recent years, but you can see for yourself. The new NFTimeless app lets non-guest users get a condition report for their NFT collections showing which NFTs are offchain and broken.\n\nFor collections that are already broken, there's nothing to be done. But fortunately for projects with offchain storage that haven't been lost yet, they can employ a rising technique for retroactive durability that doesn't require deploying a second collection: ERC-4804.\n\nThis standard is like an HTTP-style system for Ethereum, introducing a new kind of URI web3:// that lets NFT metadata be fetched directly from smart contracts. The URI doesn't point offchain, but rather describes an onchain read.\n\nWhen an NFT marketplace sees a web3:// URI, it can translate the provided ENS link into an eth_call, execute it against a smart contract, and treat the returned data as NFT metadata.\n\nFor example, imagine an NFT contract whose tokenURI(123) returns web3://testcollection.eth/tokenURI/123:\n\n➢ A marketplace resolves testcollection.eth via ENS to an Ethereum address\n\n➢ It calls tokenURI(uint256) on that contract with argument 123\n\n➢ The contract returns JSON metadata (name, description, image, attributes)\n\n➢ The marketplace renders the NFT using that data, just like it would with IPFS but without any offchain dependencies\n\nThis approach means metadata can be generated or stored entirely onchain, either in the same NFT contract or in a separate metadata resolver contract. The web3:// scheme makes calls verifiable and independent of any gateway staying online.\n\nThis is powerful because it's a straightforward way for old NFT collections to keep their original token contracts untouched, deploy new onchain metadata contracts, and update their baseURIs to point to the relevant web3:// ENS link. It's just a new pointer system, so no NFT migrations are needed.\n\nAfter any updates, marketplaces would fetch metadata directly from Ethereum itself, and thanks to the URI anyone can reproduce the necessary calls forever.\n\nThis standard also matters because even projects that do store their art and metadata onchain have historically been forced to publish ipfs:// or https:// baseURIs as apps and wallets didn't know how to read anything else. Now these projects have a viable onchain alternative.\n\nAnother important wrinkle: @opensea just added support for ERC-4804. It's a big validation for the standard and an indication that it can gain serious traction from here. The minting platform Carve is already planning on adding support, and more integrations will follow.\n\nAs we look ahead, one thread I'll be watching is ERC-4804 adoption. It could quietly become one of the most important tools we've seen yet for NFT durability in the Ethereum ecosystem.","gravity_id":"372676787","id":74294,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T14:50:02.425Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T15:10:05.166Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-08T14:40:45.087Z","text_content":"QuarkChain 2025 Annual Summary is out.\n\n2025 was a defining year as QuarkChain aligned deeper with #Ethereum and brought the Super World Computer (SWC) from vision to reality.\n\nFrom our Layer 2 development milestones, web3:// decentralized access, and core Ethereum research, to global ecosystem engagement — here’s a concise look at what we built and learned.\n\n👉 Read the full 2025 Annual Report: https://t.co/enW6okrN9E","gravity_id":"372680523","id":74295,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T14:50:02.796Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T15:10:05.416Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-08T14:54:11.827Z","text_content":"#Crypto  Cools Down After January Rally: Fed Rate Cut Hopes Subside  #Cryptocurrencies  like $BTC  and $ETH  have seen a pullback after an early January surge, as market expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts begin to temper.
