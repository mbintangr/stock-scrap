Combined with his lack of a top-tier academic background and limited fundraising experience, he found it challenging to convince investors. Under these circumstances, he chose to bootstrap the project, validating his judgment through concrete technical progress rather than repeated explanations. Tomasz noted that while this path involved sustained pressure and significant challenges, being accountable primarily to the work itself—rather than to external capital—made the pressure more manageable and better suited to the realities of early-stage core technology exploration.\n\nSource: https://t.co/qHxj8fJOhO","gravity_id":"372744555","id":79044,"createdAt":"2026-01-11T04:00:03.436Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-11T05:10:05.987Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-11T03:51:02.448Z","text_content":"⚡️AN ETHEREUM OG IS SELLING\r \r LookOnChain flagged an Ethereum OG who bought 154,076 ETH at around $517.

Launching a groundbreaking Mainnet when broader engagement is quiet would not do justice to the technology we’ve built.\n\nThe Privacy Narrative\nHowever, silence in the market does not mean silence in development. Shortly, we will be pushing the latest commits related to the Privacy Layer architecture to our GitHub repository. We have been closely monitoring the resurgence of the Privacy narrative, highlighted by the recent momentum of ZEC. It validates what Mazze was born to be: Fast, Secure, PoW and above all - PRIVATE.\n\nOur Strategic Move\nInstead of rushing, we are capitalizing on this time to accelerate the development of our Privacy Layer. We believe privacy is the next major priority for the blockchain space.\n\nThe Technical Advantage\nBy finalizing the Privacy Layer now, we can integrate it directly into the Mainnet launch. What does this mean for you?\n\n- A fully featured chain from Day 1.\n- No need for messy hard forks shortly after launch.\n- No resyncing hassles for our node runners and miners.\n\nLooking Ahead\nWe are not just waiting for the market to wake up; we are building the alarm clock.

When should you take out a loan to buy shitcoins? (All 1W timeframes).  Let's look at altcoin dominance (OTHERS.D): it has been in a downtrend for 4 years, and the range has narrowed. I expect we'll see more sideways movement, during which positions will be redistributed. The first half of 2026 will likely be the preparation phase for at least a 1-2 year explosion of altcoins to the moon. This also coincides with the upcoming appointment of a new Fed chair and other potential macro events (we'd need to dive into the news, but that's not our focus here – we're looking at the technicals, or at least trying, haha).  The Russell 2000 Index, according to many, is a direct indicator of altseason. Comparing cycles, after breaking its ATH and entering a price discovery phase, altcoins started with a 77-day lag. This time, the Russell 2000 seems a bit tired of handing out gifts and decided to give it a push – again, the market was fulfilling its obligations, and there were a ton of longs. Now, the Russell 2000 has already broken its ATH and is transitioning into a price discovery phase (let's pray for it).  $ETH  is our main altcoin, but in reality, nothing depends on it. I've drawn a ton of lines on its chart to confuse everyone. The projected movement for $ETH  is based on potential manipulations, distributions, etc.  ETHBTC – Ethereum against Bitcoin is holding up solidly; this is a normal correction within a trend change. We could move to fill the 1W FVG in the first half of 2026, but it's a double-edged sword.  Conclusion: Altseason is likely to take place in the second half of 2026. DYOR  P.S.

The market is surely to support your doing good right now and it gets better next week and all through early 2026. We have the support of the market—Crypto.\n\nEthereum has been rising (fighting) through a recovery since 21-November. We saw some action even some excitement but not much more. The last high ended as a lower high compared to 10-December but even with this bearish signal I continue to predict for you, additional growth.\n\nEther now closed four days red, nothing much. The action continues to happen above EMA34. This level first conquered as resistance and now confirmed as support.\n\nEarly July 2025 it was the same. The action hovered around EMA34 as the market was consolidating. The result was the continuation of the bullish wave. This time, we get a resumption and we can say, yes! It seems to be happening today. At least, this is the start.\n\nNext week... Do we start green right away?\n\nEthereum is now rising above $3,000, you know, a major level. Trading above $3,100, still pretty early and slow. No volume at all. How to interpret these signals? Easy of course.\n\nThe main low 21-November 2025 was $2,623. The last peak was $3,447. The action is happening much closer to resistance vs support. The action is a recovery based on the November rise. Since we are neutral now, the same conditions as before the neutral period valid remains. This means that we are bullish and a continuation is set to develop. That's my interpretation of the chart and signals at this point.\n\nNo bearish action is bullish action. When the market was bearish, four consecutive days red after a lower high would definitely cover lots of ground and even produce a new low. This isn't the case anymore. Four days red did nothing, and that's because the bears are gone. Sellers are gone. Tomorrow we get a resumption.","gravity_id":"372754766","id":80007,"createdAt":"2026-01-11T17:50:02.274Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-11T17:50:02.274Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-11T17:43:50.824Z","text_content":"JUST IN : 💰 #Data  released by Bitrace, the mixing #protocol  Tornado Cash business address received a total of 693,412 ETH in 2025, with a total value of about $2.5 billion USD. #crypto  $ETH","gravity_id":"372753693","id":80008,"createdAt":"2026-01-11T17:50:02.677Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-11T17:50:02.677Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-11T17:43:19.221Z","text_content":"$ETH Are you okay with Bitcoin believers talking nonsense about preserving value?
