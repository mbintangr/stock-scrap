According to X’s head of product Nikita Bier, the drop is not caused by an algorithm change.\n\n- Bier said users exhaust their own visibility by posting or replying too frequently, often with low-value messages. Once an account hits its daily exposure limit, later posts receive minimal distribution.\n\n- X users typically see only 20–30 posts per day. When those slots are filled with repetitive replies or engagement farming, substantive updates fail to surface.\n\nDisagreement Over Responsibility\n\n- Bier described Crypto Twitter’s decline as “self-inflicted,” arguing that excessive posting reduces reach for meaningful content.\n\n- Many users pushed back, saying the explanation ignores systemic suppression and treats symptoms rather than causes. \n\n- Crypto remains one of X’s largest content categories, yet engagement continues to fall.\n\nSpam and Automation Add Pressure\n\n- CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju argues that the situation cannot be explained by user behavior alone.\n\n- Ju pointed to a surge in automated crypto-related posts, with more than 7.7 million posts generated in a single day. That represents an increase of over 1,200% from previous levels.\n\n- According to Ju, this flood of low-quality content appears to have triggered broad visibility restrictions that affect legitimate accounts alongside bots.\n\n- He criticized X for applying category-level suppression instead of improving bot detection.\n\nPaid Verification Fails as a Filter\n\n- Ju also questioned X’s paid verification model, saying it has failed to distinguish real users from automated accounts.\n\n- Bots can now pay for verification and continue posting at scale, while genuine users experience reduced reach. \n\n- As a result, verification no longer signals credibility or quality.\n\nYouTube Shows Similar Declines\n\n- Crypto-related YouTube views have dropped to their lowest levels since early 2021. \n\n- Data shared by ITC Crypto founder Benjamin Cowen showed a steady decline in average views across major channels over the past three months.\n\n- Several creators noted that engagement never recovered after the last market cycle.\n\nRetail Interest Remains Weak\n\n- Creators across YouTube, TikTok, and X report similar trends.\n\n- Retail audiences appear fatigued after years of scams, failed projects, and speculative cycles. Some creators attribute the decline to repeated pump-and-dump schemes that pushed viewers away.\n\n- Others note that institutional participants now dominate market activity, reducing the role of retail-driven narratives.\n\n- Some analysts argue that audiences have moved toward macro assets and traditional markets.\n\n- Returns, rather than long-term crypto narratives, are driving attention. In recent periods, commodities and metals outperformed Bitcoin, reinforcing the shift.\n\nSentiment Shows Early Stabilization\n\n- Despite lower engagement, on-chain analytics firms report improving sentiment around Bitcoin.\n\n- Sentiment around Ethereum remains mixed, with no clear trend. Analysts say key price levels will determine whether retail confidence returns.","gravity_id":"372768580","id":80684,"createdAt":"2026-01-12T05:30:03.421Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T06:00:06.059Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-12T05:39:00.423Z","text_content":"$ETH  on a scale of 1-100 how much of a scam is ETH and all the other ALT coins","gravity_id":"372768757","id":80696,"createdAt":"2026-01-12T05:40:02.989Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T06:40:05.960Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-12T05:36:12.868Z","text_content":"🚨 UPDATE: $ETH is now ~37% away from its ATH.","gravity_id":"372768728","id":80698,"createdAt":"2026-01-12T05:40:03.803Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T06:10:04.970Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-12T05:33:26.196Z","text_content":"📊 MARKET: $ETH will wipe out $2.95B in short just by climbing 11%.","gravity_id":"372768700","id":80699,"createdAt":"2026-01-12T05:40:04.207Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T06:10:05.224Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-12T05:57:10.789Z","text_content":"$ETH  is forming a higher low pattern on the 4H timeframe.

Ethereum $ETH   is trading at $3,154.80, up 1.88% in the last 24 hours, supported by a clear rise in market activity and investor demand.

This surge in volume suggests renewed participation from traders rather than a low-liquidity price move.  The volume-to-market cap ratio of 3.91% reflects healthy liquidity and steady buying interest across spot and derivatives markets. Ethereum’s circulating supply of 120.69M ETH matches its total supply, with no maximum cap, making demand dynamics especially important for price movement.
