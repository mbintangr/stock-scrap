While Bitcoin prices reacted positively in the short term, the real significance of this bill lies in its structural implications rather than immediate price movements.\n\nThe bill seeks to clearly distinguish crypto assets as either commodities or securities and define which regulatory authorities oversee each category. Until now, regulatory ambiguity has largely been addressed through enforcement actions, leaving market participants uncertain. This draft aims to reduce that uncertainty by clarifying classification criteria in advance.\n\nNotably, fully decentralized networks and DeFi protocols are not treated as traditional financial intermediaries. Developers, validators, and node operators are not automatically classified as regulated entities, reflecting an acknowledgment of decentralization as a core structural feature. In contrast, centralized exchanges, brokers, and custodians face clearer requirements on registration, asset segregation, and disclosure—designed to support sustainable operations rather than suppress innovation. Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and spot ETFs are all assumed to remain part of the U.S. financial system.\n\nOn-chain data already reflects this transition. CryptoQuant’s Spot Average Order Size shows that around the $90,000 level, retail participation remains limited, while mid- to large-sized orders are relatively prominent. This suggests neither speculative retail euphoria nor panic selling, but a phase in which large investors cautiously adjust positions while awaiting regulatory clarity.\n\nClear U.S. market structure rules are likely to influence institutional behavior and global regulatory discussions. While this bill is not a short-term price catalyst, on-chain indicators suggest the crypto market is already shifting from headline-driven moves toward a structure-driven phase. \n\nhttps://t.co/lcl8zocPZ4—-On-Chain-Data-Signals-Early-Institutional-Positioning","gravity_id":"372820794","id":84399,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T21:50:03.065Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T22:00:06.251Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-13T21:41:04.467Z","text_content":"🏦 Some firms hoard cash.

Can Ether produce a new all-time high in early 2026?\n\n#Ethereum #ETH #ETHUSDT\n\nLet me ask you a question, do you think Ethereum will peak below the last high around $5,000, or will it move higher? Tough question right?\n\nCan we ask the chart and market?\n\nLet's do some speculative technical analysis.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum and a group of the big projects tend to move together, it tends to happen. As the market evolves, we are seeing how easily things change.\n\nBitcoin went on to produce a very strong all-time high compared to 2021, twice as high. Just to recap, back in 2021 Bitcoin peaked around $69,000. Bitcoin went on to produce a new all-time high in 2024 and then again in 2025 with a maximum price of $126,000. Ethereum didn't follow.\n\nEthereum peaked 2021 around $4,800 and recently, August 2025, Ethereum reached $4,957, a technical double-top. This is our context. Bitcoin did awesome. Ethereum also did good but not great.\n\nEthereum is now moving daily above EMA55. This signal, once confirmed, opens up bullish momentum for 1-3 months—mid-term. Seeing the lack of a new all-time high in 2024, and how we got a shy all-time high in 2025, it is possible to see Ethereum break beyond this barrier.\n\nEthereum challenged the $4,800 - $5,000 resistance zone twice already. Right now we have a very strong higher low compared to the start of the current move in April 2025. The drop from August to November was also a mild one when comparing to a full blown bear market as in 2022. So there is a strong possibility that the last resistance will not hold.\n\nIf we think about Bitcoin and say, \"But, Bitcoin is likely to produce a lower high. How can Ethereum produce a higher high while Bitcoin produces a lower high?\"\n\nIt is possible just as it happened in reverse. Bitcoin moved to hit a new all-time high while Ethereum was trading within the 2021 ATH range. This dynamic can alternate. Say, while Bitcoin is weak.\n\nNamaste.","gravity_id":"372820987","id":84451,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T22:20:04.992Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T22:30:05.394Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-13T22:10:40.133Z","text_content":"See a huge dump on  $ETH to around $3k,  $ETH which is currently around $3.2k region will definitely tap $3k region before any major movement.... \n\nExpect the dump of ETH soon,  $BTC still at $94k which  will definitely drop too\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights# #What is your Bitcoin Price Prediction?# #ETH","gravity_id":"372820986","id":84452,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T22:20:05.413Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T22:20:05.413Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-13T22:09:46.763Z","text_content":"#Ethereum  is up 4.5% today and is testing the upper line of the parallel channel.

But the $93k–$109k overhead supply zone plus spot/ETF flows still determine whether upside breaks out or stalls—heavy above, buy-the-dip behavior below.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nMarket Summary\n• BTC rebounded back into the $93k–$94k area; next psychological focus is $100k (where psychology, flows, derivatives, and on-chain levels overlap)\n• U.S. spot BTC ETF flow has shown early signs of stabilizing day-to-day (some “less one-way” behavior), slightly improving upside conditions\n• Still, $93,000–$109,000 is a major LTH cost-basis cluster, meaning rallies can face systematic sell-on-strength pressure\n• Corporate treasury accumulation remains a structural bid, supporting the idea that downside breaks are harder to sustain\n• ETH pushed back above $3,200; network participation (new wallet creation) appears to lead price rather than follow it\n• European banking adoption headlines continue to add “institutional infrastructure” tailwinds\n• Geopolitical risk (Iran-related headlines) and political risk (pressure on Fed independence) remain volatility amplifiers\n• Conclusion: upside needs spot flow + volume; downside is supported by lighter leverage + structural demand\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOn-chain & Technical Trends\n• Key resistance: $93k–$109k (heavy LTH accumulation zone) — a decisive break requires strong spot demand\n• $100k is not just a round-number: it aligns with short-term holder cost-basis dynamics, making it a structural inflection point\n• Open Interest has meaningfully declined from prior peaks (deleveraging), reducing the probability of cascading liquidations\n• However, if OI re-accelerates sharply, it can become a liquidation trigger in either direction (gradual rise = healthier, sudden spike = riskier)\n• If futures sell pressure continues to cool, the range floor becomes more resilient (sets up reversal potential)\n• Rising activity in dormant/mid-term coins can add supply overhead in the short term, increasing sensitivity near resistance\n• Tactical levels: holding above $94k is constructive; losing key bands tends to pull price back into the prior range\n• Conclusion: bottoming conditions are building, but trend formation still needs spot flow and volume confirmation\n―――――――――――――――――――\nSentiment\n• Fear & Greed remains in “Fear” territory even with price recovering — limited overheating, participation still cautious\n• If the market starts anchoring on $100k, retail FOMO can ignite quickly; failure near that area can also trigger fast disappointment selling\n• Political messaging around rate cuts and Fed leadership increases headline risk and policy uncertainty\n• Geopolitical shocks can create fast risk-off moves, but lighter leverage often leads to “not as deep” follow-through on the downside\n• Altcoins remain theme-driven (regulation, payments, infrastructure, institutional adoption) rather than broad index-style risk-on\n• Retail participation still looks muted, so sustainability depends on real spot demand\n• Conclusion: fear-skewed environment supports buy-the-dip behavior, but chasing upside needs flow confirmation\n―――――――――――――――――――\nU.S. Traditional Markets\n• CPI came in roughly in-line to slightly reassuring, easing immediate macro pressure\n• If yields and the dollar remain stable-to-soft post-CPI, BTC typically benefits on the margin\n• Rising political pressure on Fed independence can lift volatility across rates, FX, and gold, spilling into crypto\n• “Oil as a policy lever” rhetoric can swing inflation expectations and rate-cut narratives\n• Even when equities are firm, crypto upside is often primarily driven by ETF/spot demand\n• Conclusion: macro is slightly improved, but crypto still needs “flows first” to sustain upside\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOverall Assessment\nCPI reduced near-term macro stress and supports a continuation of the rebound. But the $93k–$109k zone remains a heavy overhead supply area, so a true breakout requires spot/ETF flow plus volume follow-through. With sentiment still cautious, dips are easier to buy than tops are to chase. Manage upside expectations until flows and OI behavior confirm.\nWhat to watch today:\n• Whether U.S. spot BTC ETF flows can stay positive for consecutive days (top priority)\n• Whether $94k holds and price “accepts” higher levels with real volume (quality of the move)\n• Whether OI rises gradually or spikes (next liquidation-risk signal)\n• Whether Fear & Greed improves steadily or whipsaws (steady = healthier, sudden jump = overheating risk)\n• Headline volatility from politics/geopolitics (position sizing and stop discipline)","gravity_id":"372823448","id":84519,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T22:50:04.701Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T23:20:05.555Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-13T22:40:45.064Z","text_content":"ETHGas airdrop registration!⛽️\n\nProbably a small stimmy to fill the fridge 🪂\n\nIf you have spend some ETH in gas, do it. \n\n💰Raised $12M\n\nhttp://www.ethgas.com/community/onboarding?referral=3GGDS5Q","gravity_id":"372823446","id":84520,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T22:50:04.979Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T23:10:05.576Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-13T22:58:37.364Z","text_content":"$ETH  Successful implementation of the uptrend scenario after the breakdown of resistance level (3184.54 and 3265.31).

That forecast stands in sharp contrast to current price behavior, where ETH is still working through nearby supply rather than trending freely. The gap between the long-term thesis and present structure is where the real discussion sits.  For ETH to reach that level, demand cannot be episodic. With a circulating supply of roughly 120 million ETH, moving from today’s market cap toward multi-trillion territory requires trillions in net marginal demand that stays in the system. That means capital must be retained through staking, long-duration holding, and repeated cycles where new demand turns into inactive supply rather than exiting during corrections. Without that dynamic, price expansion struggles to compound.  In the short to medium term, ETH is rebuilding after a multi-month downtrend. Price recently pushed into a major supply zone near $3,350, an area that has capped upside before. A 7% daily move following recent CPI data helped $ETH   reclaim rising trend support, keeping higher lows intact. At the time of writing, price trades near $3,325, compressed just below overhead supply.  If ETH can reclaim $3,350 with sustained acceptance, rotation toward $3,600 becomes structurally justified. Holding above that level would open a path toward the $4,000 region. Momentum indicators remain constructive rather than overheated, suggesting controlled demand. Failure to reclaim supply, however, would keep ETH range-bound and delay expansion.  The takeaway is simple. Standard Chartered’s $40,000 call depends on sustained capital retention, not short-term rallies. The structure can support continuation, but only if reclaimed levels turn into long-term support rather than temporary milestones.","gravity_id":"372839329","id":85847,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T14:00:03.808Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T14:10:05.193Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-14T13:51:02.126Z","text_content":"Chart momentum sends $ETH  toward $4000 while short-term holders remain a key risk  #Ethereum  #ETH  #Macro Insights#    https://yellow.com/news/ethereum-targets-dollar4000-after-pattern-breakout-but-short-term-holders-pose-risk","gravity_id":"372844202","id":85848,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T14:00:04.080Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T14:10:05.465Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-14T14:03:45.498Z","text_content":"BTC has been the clear institutional favorite in 2025, consistently capturing 70,85% of total crypto ETF market share.

Short answer - not yet, but the setup is getting interesting.  What the data says 👇 • ETH trades near $3,290 with rising volume - participation is improving • ETH/BTC ~0.0346 has stabilized after a long downtrend, but remains below historical breakout zones • 36M+ ETH staked, locking supply and reducing sell pressure • Exchange balances keep falling - fewer coins ready to be sold  This is conviction without speculation. On-chain flows look balanced, not euphoric. That’s healthy - but it’s not an altseason trigger.  What still needs to happen: 1️⃣ ETH must outperform BTC consistently, not just for a few sessions 2️⃣ Mid & small-cap alts must show broad volume expansion 3️⃣ Risk appetite and liquidity must increase across the board  Right now, $ETH  strength signals a transitional phase, not a full rotation.

Nothing obviously dangerous.\n\nInstead of relying on a quick scan, the team ran the contract through AI Hub V2’s in depth audit mode, built to surface real world failure paths, not just surface level issues.\n\nThe in depth audit flagged 12 issues, including 3 critical vulnerabilities that could have led to full protocol compromise if deployed as is.\n\nOne example was simple but dangerous.\n\nA core function that controlled reward rates had no access control. Anyone could change emissions, either draining the reward pool or shutting rewards off completely.\n\nAnother issue involved ownership checks using tx.origin. That pattern makes phishing style takeovers possible with a single bad transaction.\n\nThe most serious finding was arbitrary delegatecall execution. An authorized address could run any logic in the contract’s context. If that address was compromised, ownership, funds, and internal state were all at risk.\n\nThe auditor also uncovered multiple reentrancy paths, including ETH withdrawals and reward claims where value was transferred before state was updated. Under the right conditions, this could allow repeated withdrawals or duplicated rewards.\n\nNone of these issues were obvious at first glance.\nThey only appeared when the contract was treated as something that could be attacked, not just something that compiles.\n\nThat is the value of an in depth audit inside AI Hub V2.\n\nIt shows you how a contract can fail before users ever touch it.\n\nRead the full audit report here: https://t.co/HLAju1ec85\n\nTry auditing your contracts today with AI Hub V2:\nhttps://t.co/56qupSAbe6","gravity_id":"372844836","id":86055,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T15:40:03.264Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T15:50:03.591Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-14T15:46:45.116Z","text_content":"0xBADBB JUST BROKE EVEN ON $300M LONG POSITIONS\n\nThe $300M Long Crypto Whale 0xBADBB is back - and has just broken even on his ETH, XRP and HYPE longs.\n\nHis current positions:\nLONG $197.86M ETH\nLONG $82.94M XRP\nLONG $20.86M HYPE\n\nNow, will 0xBADBB make it all back? \nTrack 0xBADBB on Arkham with this custom entity:\n\nhttps://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/70477c9f-8818-4937-bd65-f3e348d2c442\nRegister for Arkham.

The goal is to accumulate up to 5% of total ETH supply, or roughly 6 million ETH, and stake most or all of it. Staked ETH is not easily sold and takes time to unlock, which reduces active market supply.  At current staking rates near 2.8%, that position would generate approximately 170,000 ETH per year in rewards. Those rewards grow in dollar value as ETH price rises.  This creates two effects at once: liquid ETH supply shrinks, and ETH-denominated income increases.  In 2025, exchange balances fell below 10 million ETH after sitting near 14 million ETH earlier in the year. When a single treasury is holding over 4 million ETH off exchanges, the impact on liquidity becomes meaningful.  This isn’t about controlling total supply. It’s about controlling tradable supply.  When demand returns, price doesn’t need years to adjust. It reprices at the margin.  The accumulation happened quietly. The effects show up later.
