The confirmation already came from Bitcoin and hundreds of altcoins, we looked at hundreds of charts but here we have it again from the Queen itself—#2. How good can it get?\n\nWe are looking at Monero going ballistic and we saw what happened with Zcash. These are not normal movements these are extraordinary feats. We saw this same dynamic happening with many other smaller projects, growth beyond 3,000%. These are too small to mention but it is happening; bull market type of bullish action. For Ethereum, what can we expect?\n\nThe whole introduction is just to say that we can expect a strong bullish wave. Like I mentioned in a recent article, I don't think we peak below ATH, I don't think Ether will remain as a lower high and let everybody down with a lack of massive growth. No bull run for Ethereum and then a bear market? I don't know, I don't think so.\n\nI think Ethereum is Crypto and Crypto is awesome. Ethereum will do whatever it needs to do to make up for all the hardships we went through when the market was down. It will make it all up to us with a massive bullish run.\n\nETHUSDT is now trading above EMA89 on the daily timeframe with a bullish MACD and strong RSI. Still moving as a lower high compared to 10-December 2025. The peak then was $3,444.44. I'll tell you why this level is yet to break.\n\nAll the stop-loss orders for the bears are set right above this level. Many have their systems running on auto-pilot while others are praying that for some reason the market will reverse. Thus the market continues slow for a surprise move.\n\n\nNamaste.","gravity_id":"372884160","id":88140,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T18:10:03.913Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T18:40:04.616Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-15T18:14:20.779Z","text_content":"Short $ETH \r \r Entry: CMP\r \r SL: Above recent high\r \r TP: 3200 → 3100 zone\r \r Bias: Short-term bearish, trade with strict risk management  \r \r DYOR, NFA\r #ETH  #Altcoin Season#  #Altcoin Season#  #BNBChain#  $BTC","gravity_id":"372885019","id":88155,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T18:20:02.693Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T19:00:04.347Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-15T18:12:53.828Z","text_content":"#Ethereum   staking just hit an all-time high Seeing so many investors lock up their $ETH   really shows long-term confidence in the network.

According to trader Michael Soloway, this kind of sideways action often “stores energy” for the next move - as long as Bitcoin stays above its main support line, the short-term setup remains constructive.  Soloway says there’s a solid chance BTC makes a push toward $100,000. But there’s a catch: $100K isn’t just a number - it’s a psychological wall, and it can easily turn into a heavy selling zone once price taps it.  On the $ETH  side, the picture is mixed but interesting. Ethereum bounced off a major support level that has held multiple times before, opening the door toward $3,600–$3,700 - but Soloway warns the medium-term resistance is still strong, so ETH will need real momentum to keep climbing.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #ETH   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372906195","id":89182,"createdAt":"2026-01-16T10:40:02.842Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-16T11:10:05.598Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-16T10:40:45.046Z","text_content":"Multiple Ethereum onchain metrics are at all-time highs!\nDaily transactions are at record levels.\n\n2.8M daily tx on Ethereum mainnet on Jan 15.

According to Glassnode, new-user retention doubled, with active addresses jumping from ~4M to 8M this month - signaling fresh wallets, not just repeat activity.  What’s driving the spike 👇 • Daily transactions hit a record 2.8M (+125% YoY) • Active addresses crossed 1M • 36M+ $ETH  staked, tightening liquid supply • More execution on Layer 2s, settlement on L1 → lower fees, higher throughput  Fundamentals look healthier - but price action remains cautious. $ETH  is consolidating around $3.3K, with traders waiting for clearer confirmation before committing size.  Why the hesitation? • Overhead supply still caps upside • Key levels like the 200-day EMA remain unclaimed • Positioning suggests repair, not breakout (yet)  This is classic early-cycle behavior: network usage accelerates first, price follows later - if structure confirms.

Historically, this has often been a signal of upcoming market growth. If you don’t even have a basic position in BTC or Ethereum yet, I’d recommend buying at least a partial position.  Especially Ethereum. I personally expect it to reach $6,000 this year, and I believe it will capture most of the market’s attention. It’s the only major altcoin that still hasn’t broken its 2021 all-time high, unlike other top altcoins. And of course, it remains the second-largest asset in crypto.  If you zoom out on the chart, it becomes clear that historically Ethereum has been moving within a parallel channel, with the upper boundary around $6,000–$6,500 🚀  That area is where we should be cautious — price could get rejected and move lower from there. So once we reach that zone, it makes sense to take partial profits.  This summer, we failed to break the midline of that channel (blue dotted line). I think the second attempt will succeed.  And don’t forget about other assets as well. Just yesterday, I shared a trade idea where I expect up to +80% upside — you can take a look at that one too.

As Bitcoin ($BTC ) and digital assets continue gaining attention, Goldman Sachs is actively exploring tokenization, stablecoins, and prediction markets. CEO David Solomon noted the bank is testing where these technologies can enhance its business, while closely monitoring the evolving U.S. regulatory landscape.
