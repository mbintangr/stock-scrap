Active addresses have more than doubled year over year, rising above one million.\n\n- Retention metrics also jumped sharply, signaling that new wallets are continuing to use the network rather than appearing briefly and leaving.\n\nSTABLECOINS DRIVE THE SPIKE\n\n- Stablecoins are now a major source of Ethereum traffic. Transfers involving dollar-pegged tokens account for a large share of daily transactions.\n\n- As payment, trading, and settlement use cases expand, Ethereum has become a high-volume rails system rather than a purely speculative chain.\n\nLOW FEES CHANGE THE STORY\n\n- Despite record activity, transaction costs have collapsed. Average gas fees sit near historic lows, with many basic transactions costing only a few cents.\n\n- This combination of high usage and low fees marks a shift for a network once known for congestion during peak demand.\n\nUPGRADES BEGIN TO SHOW RESULTS\n\n- Recent protocol upgrades played a key role. Ethereum increased block capacity while shifting most execution to layer-2 networks.\n\n- Mainnet demand eased even as total activity climbed, allowing the base layer to focus on settlement and security.","gravity_id":"372998083","id":93613,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T05:00:03.450Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T05:20:05.246Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-19T04:52:45.113Z","text_content":"THE WHALE ROTATION!\n\nOn-chain alerts: \n\nLarge wallets are moving $BTC profits into $ETH and $SUI. \n\nThe \"RWA Overhang\" has temporarily cooled institutional interest in tokenized treasuries.\n\nFollow the smart money.\n\nMove to the infrastructure until the supply shocks subside.

Many crypto holders prefer earning yield instead of leaving assets idle. Today, major exchanges offer staking and earn products that allow users to generate passive income on coins like BTC, $ETH  , and stablecoins. Platforms such as Bitget, Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and OKX are among the most commonly used for this purpose.  How Do Exchanges Help Users Earn Passive Income?  Most platforms generate yield through staking, flexible savings, or locked earn products. Flexible options allow withdrawals anytime but usually pay less, while locked products offer higher returns in exchange for fixed holding periods.  Which Platforms Offer the Best Passive Income Options?  Bitget – Earn and staking products across BTC, ETH, altcoins, and stablecoins with flexible and fixed options Binance – Wide range of earn, staking, and DeFi-style products Coinbase – Simple staking on major proof-of-stake coins Kraken – Reliable on-chain staking with consistent payouts OKX – Earn, staking, and higher-yield options for experienced users  Bitget and Binance provide the most variety and flexibility. Coinbase and Kraken focus on simplicity and reliability, while OKX offers more advanced yield options. The best choice depends on your assets and risk tolerance.  Conclusion Passive income in crypto is now widely available. Bitget, Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and OKX all offer ways to earn yield, but differ in flexibility and supported assets. Always review terms and risks before committing funds.  FAQ Is passive income on crypto guaranteed? No. Returns vary and carry risk. Can I withdraw anytime? Only with flexible products. Can Bitcoin earn yield? BTC doesn’t stake, but some earn products generate yield on BTC. #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"373009962","id":94316,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T12:30:03.251Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T12:40:03.979Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-19T12:22:45.300Z","text_content":"Fenbushi Capital Wallet Unstakes and Sends 7,798 ETH to Binance \n-   https://coinfomania.com/fenbushi-capital-wallet-unstakes-and-sends-7798-eth-to-binance/ ","gravity_id":"373009952","id":94317,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T12:30:03.442Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T12:40:04.224Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-19T12:22:45.296Z","text_content":"As Ethereum's Price Falls, a New Era Begins for ETH: Two New Records Broken!\nhttps://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/as-ethereum-s-price-falls-a-new-era-begins-for-eth-two-new-records-broken/?feed_id=62451&_unique_id=696e1f59d40d0","gravity_id":"373007122","id":94318,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T12:30:03.629Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T12:40:04.546Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-19T12:22:45.190Z","text_content":"Ethereum Complexity Sparks Warning From Vitalik Buterin \n-   https://coinfomania.com/ethereum-complexity-sparks-warning-from-vitalik-buterin/ ","gravity_id":"373007119","id":94319,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T12:30:03.845Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T12:40:04.863Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-19T12:22:45.118Z","text_content":"Crypto Market Outlook 📊\n\n🔸 $BTC Dominance: 59.1%\n🔹 $ETH Dominance: 12.4%\n🔸 Fear & Greed Index: 45 (Neutral)\n\n#BTC #ETH #CryptoMarket","gravity_id":"373009948","id":94320,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T12:30:04.175Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T12:40:05.204Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-19T12:22:00.127Z","text_content":"#Ethereum  just did what many thought was impossible 👀  For years,  $ETH  felt too expensive to use. $30–$50 gas fees locked out everyday users during the 2021 bull run and the 2024 NFT wave. Fast-forward forward to January 2026 — average gas fees are sitting around $0.01.  And no, this isn’t because Ethereum is “dead.” It’s the opposite.  Thanks to Fusaka, PeerDAS, and massive Layer 2 adoption, Ethereum cleared congestion and evolved into a high-throughput settlement layer. On Jan 17, the network processed 2.6M transactions in a single day — without fee spikes.  The Solana comparison now looks different. Ethereum offers low fees plus decentralization and security. Speed vs resilience is the real debate now, not cost.  Yes, lower fees slow ETH burn and make supply slightly inflationary short-term. But usage is the real signal — and usage is exploding.  ETH isn’t just scaling in 2026.

The chart can’t tell you who’s doing it or why.\n\nRight now, a meaningful chunk of new staking is coming from pretty large players, including corporate treasuries and professional operators (Bitmine, SharpLink, etc.)\n\n(not just long-term believers quietly parking ETH for years)\n\nThen there’s the queue problem.\n\nWe know that Ethereum limits how fast validators can enter or exit. So when demand to stake jumps, it doesn’t show up right away. It gets backed up in a line that can last weeks.\n\nThat means today’s “record staking” partly reflects decisions made weeks ago, not fresh conviction. \n\nIt’s a slow indicator pretending to be a fast one.\n\nNot to mention that “Locked” doesn’t mean locked.\n\nSometimes we forget that a lot of staked ETH is liquid staked, meaning that tokens can be sold, borrowed against, or reused in DeFi.\n\nSo the ETH is technically locked, but the exposure isn’t - and that creates a bit of an illusion.\n\n- Bulls see less ETH on exchanges and think supply is gone.\n\n- Bears see those wrapper tokens being reused and think leverage is building.\n\nBoth are right, depending on where the stress shows up.\n\nSo when you see “30% of ETH staked,” the real question isn’t whether that is bullish. \n\nIt’s who staked it, how liquid is it really, and how fast can it change its mind?","gravity_id":"373013920","id":94835,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T16:50:02.664Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T17:30:05.563Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-19T16:43:45.071Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nA whale is currently selling a total of 13,000 $ETH through Galaxy Digital.\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"373017564","id":94836,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T16:50:02.993Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T17:20:04.525Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-19T16:42:24.169Z","text_content":"🐋 ETH/BTC failed to rebound again - altcoins under pressureAnother attempt at growth for ETH/BTC ended in failure.
