Ethereum is showing massive bullish signs in January 2026.

Locked Supply: Roughly 29% of all $ETH   is off the market to secure the network.  Zero Selling Pressure: The validator \"exit queue\" hit 0, meaning nobody is waiting to unstake and sell.  🏦 The Institutional Giant: Bitmine (BMNR) Tom Lee and Bitmine are leading the charge. They are buying $ETH  faster than almost anyone else.  The Bag: Bitmine now holds 4.17 Million ETH (3.45% of total supply).  Staking Move: They just doubled their staked amount to 1.25 Million ETH.  The Goal: They want to own 5% of all Ethereum!  🔮 Why this matters With institutional giants like Bitmine locking up millions of tokens and the entry queue growing, a supply shock is coming.

The process is straightforward: log in, deposit USDT, transfer it to the Perpetuals wallet, select a TradFi market like Gold or Forex, set leverage, and place the order. The app interface keeps each step clear and beginner-friendly.  TradFi trades are USDT-margined perpetuals, so exposure is purely based on price movement. Since these markets have fixed trading hours, planning and risk management matter more. Using low leverage and predefined SL/TP helps maintain discipline across different market conditions. 🔗 https://bingx.com  This approach is actually useful for anyone looking to apply structured trading habits beyond 24/7 crypto markets. #BingX  #BingXTradFi  $BTC","gravity_id":"373026889","id":95628,"createdAt":"2026-01-20T03:50:02.851Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-20T04:20:05.420Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-20T04:00:01.291Z","text_content":"LATEST: $ETH processed 2.89 million transactions in a single day, setting a new all-time high.\n\n\nThe milestone highlights continued growth in on-chain activity and network usage.","gravity_id":"373027792","id":95631,"createdAt":"2026-01-20T04:00:03.057Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-20T04:50:04.479Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-20T03:59:36.184Z","text_content":"$ETH  YOu have to PUMP FIDO Fidel because US STOCKS ready to test supply staying very bullish above the ROLLing VWAP","gravity_id":"373026972","id":95632,"createdAt":"2026-01-20T04:00:03.292Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-20T04:50:04.693Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-20T03:55:21.361Z","text_content":"$ETH  looks poopy but something is screamin Bart Up","gravity_id":"373027769","id":95633,"createdAt":"2026-01-20T04:00:03.622Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-20T04:50:05.029Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-20T04:07:45.096Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\n「Strategy Counterparty Liquidation」 Stop Loss Liquidation of $BTC and $ETH Long Positions, Positioning to Short $#Dash\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"373029007","id":95642,"createdAt":"2026-01-20T04:10:02.367Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-20T05:00:04.109Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-20T04:07:45.039Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nYihua's Trend Research is suspected to have further increased its $ETH position, transferring 10 million $USDT to #Binance\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"373027818","id":95643,"createdAt":"2026-01-20T04:10:02.696Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-20T05:00:04.440Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-20T04:04:45.042Z","text_content":"🔥 Ethereum breaks transaction records as gas drops to $0.15 & big firms like Bitmine boost staking!

However, if selling pressure intensifies and price breaks below this structure, Ethereum could slide toward the 3,050 support zone. On the upside, holding the current rebound may open a move toward the 200-day EMA, a key technical resistance.  Momentum indicators are weakening, with RSI and Stochastic Oscillator drifting back toward neutral levels, suggesting downside risk remains elevated in the short term.
