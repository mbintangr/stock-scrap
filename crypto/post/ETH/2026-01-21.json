However, continued whale accumulation and stablecoin reserves suggest this phase may evolve into a resilience test rather than a cascade sell-off. Upside confirmation should wait for clear spot-flow signals (ETF inflows and exchange outflows).\nKey watchpoints today: ETF flow reversals, OI recovery speed (watch for spikes), net exchange flows, Fear & Greed improvement (from 32 upward), and price resilience to tariff and geopolitical headlines.","gravity_id":"373054829","id":97493,"createdAt":"2026-01-20T23:10:02.565Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-21T00:10:05.779Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-20T23:11:15.624Z","text_content":"Never short a coin that just had a massive liquidation cascade.

Тhis will reduce the likelihood that a single failure or compromise will disable the validator, while maintaining anti-slashing safeguards with proper #threshold  settings.\r DVT allows #Ethereum  eаrinng participants to place their assets without complete dependence on a singlе node, Buterin siаd, noting that the validatоr will continue to function propеrlу if more than two-thirds of the nodes remain bona fidе.\r Unlike current versions of DVT, which often require complex configurations and third-рarty coordination layers, Buterin's effort involves put in place this mechanism directly into the underlying protocol. Participants holding a multiple of the minimum requirеd amоunt will be able to use up to 16 keys and a signature threshold, effеctively managing multiple stаndard nodes that will act as a single validator ID.\r Аccording to one of Ethereum's creators, this method should reduce transаction costs. Buterin claims that this structure will add only one additional delay cycle during block generaiton, will not cause an incremental delay during finalization, and will be compatible with any signature method.

You might get the direction right and still lose ground simply from costs adding up. In 2025, with markets moving tighter and traders becoming more active, choosing the right exchange matters more than ever.\n\n What Are Crypto Trading Fees and How Do They Work?\n\nMost exchanges operate on a maker and taker system.\n\nMaker fees apply when you place limit orders that add liquidity to the order book.\nTaker fees apply when you execute trades instantly, usually through market orders.\n\nBeyond this, traders also deal with withdrawal fees, funding rates on futures, and spreads that can quietly increase overall cost. Some platforms are transparent. Others make you dig a little.\n\n Which Crypto Exchanges Have the Lowest Trading Fees in 2025?\n\nFor spot trading, Bitget and Bitget remain among the cheapest, both offering around 0.10% maker and taker fees for standard users.\n\nKraken and Bitfinex sit slightly higher, while Coinbase continues to charge notably more, especially for frequent traders.\n\n\n Are Low Fees the Only Thing Traders Should Consider?\n\nFees matter, but they are only one part of the decision. Liquidity, security, regulation, platform stability, and customer support often matter more during volatile conditions.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn 2025, Bitget and Binance continue to offer some of the most competitive trading fees across spot and futures markets, while Coinbase prioritizes ease of use over cost.\n\nThe best choice depends on your trading style, volume, and how much reliability you want when markets turn unpredictable.\n\nFAQ\n\nDo trading fees really affect long-term results?\nYes. Over time, repeated fees can significantly reduce net profitability.\n\nWhy are maker fees usually cheaper?\nBecause makers add liquidity, which exchanges want to encourage.\n\n\nSource https://www.bitget.com/academy/crypto-exchange-lowest-trading-fees-2025-review-bitget","gravity_id":"373070995","id":98736,"createdAt":"2026-01-21T12:50:04.103Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-21T13:00:04.270Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-21T12:43:53.397Z","text_content":"5 years of waiting for $ETH to hit $5K.\n\nAnd it looks like gold will hit first!\nIs it patience paying off or a lesson in timing?","gravity_id":"373075010","id":98737,"createdAt":"2026-01-21T12:50:04.465Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-21T13:00:04.616Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-21T12:40:45.020Z","text_content":"🎬Tom Lee: As Wall Street Builds on Ethereum, ETH Remains Deeply Undervalued vs. Bitcoin\n\n #CoinRank #Bitcoin #Ethereum ","gravity_id":"373069985","id":98738,"createdAt":"2026-01-21T12:50:04.669Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-21T13:00:04.967Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-21T12:38:53.446Z","text_content":"$ETH  #Etherium  \r \r Been waiting for this zone to be tested and finally it has but right now it's at a buy and pray level where you don't actually know where it's headed   \r \r My idea is a breakout above 2.920 retest of the level and look for a long scalp","gravity_id":"373072988","id":98739,"createdAt":"2026-01-21T12:50:04.925Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-21T13:00:05.311Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-21T12:59:01.054Z","text_content":"5 years of waiting for ETH to hit $5K.\n\nAnd it looks like gold will hit first!  $ETH 👀","gravity_id":"373074119","id":98755,"createdAt":"2026-01-21T13:00:02.418Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-21T13:20:04.427Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-21T12:52:16.925Z","text_content":"$ETH Sharp sell-off after rejection from the supply zone.

The company just accelerated its Ethereum buying, adding over $110M worth of ETH in a single week - even as $BTC  and the broader market face growing uncertainty.  That purchase pushed BitMine’s total ETH holdings to about 4.2M coins, worth roughly $13B, or 3.48% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. This isn’t a trade. It’s a structural bet, and shareholders are clearly on board.  📊 The signal from inside the company is strong.  A majority of BitMine shareholders voted to expand authorized shares specifically to buy more ETH. As Tom Lee put it, this was a message that investors understand - and support - the long-term accumulation strategy. On top of that, BitMine has already staked about 1.84M $ETH  , locking in yield rather than keeping liquidity on the sidelines.  The takeaway is clear: despite short-term caution on the market, BitMine is playing the long game. While prices fluctuate, they’re positioning ETH as a core treasury asset - not a speculative one.  #ETH  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373076310","id":98827,"createdAt":"2026-01-21T13:40:02.567Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-21T13:50:04.100Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-21T13:38:34.010Z","text_content":"Is a $10K $ETH  on the table for this cycle?

Historically, rising transaction volume meant rising gas fees. Today, that relationship is weakening.  1. Throughput vs. Fees  Transaction activity is reaching new highs, yet average fees remain relatively contained. This reflects the growing role of Layer 2 scaling, improved block efficiency, and better fee market dynamics.  High usage no longer automatically translates into congestion pricing.  2. Staking Dynamics  Validator exits remain minimal compared to inflows, indicating continued confidence in long-term network participation. More ETH is being locked into staking, reducing liquid supply available for the open market.  This creates a subtle supply constraint over time.  3. Institutional Behavior  Large entities are increasingly engaging with staking infrastructure rather than short-term trading exposure. This shifts ETH from a purely speculative asset toward a yield-bearing network asset.  The implication is not immediate price action, but structural demand.  4. Market Implication  Ethereum is evolving into a system where: • Usage scales • Fees stay manageable • Supply becomes less liquid  This combination strengthens the network’s economic resilience rather than just its narrative.  Conclusion  Ethereum’s current fundamentals suggest maturation, not hype. Scaling efficiency + staking accumulation = long-term structural strength.  $ETH  #Ethereum  #Fundamentals  #Scalability  #CryptoAnalysis","gravity_id":"373073324","id":98831,"createdAt":"2026-01-21T13:40:04.049Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-21T13:50:05.328Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-21T13:33:02.326Z","text_content":"From a technical view, this $ETH   pullback looks like a textbook retest after breakout, not a breakdown.

As trading activity concentrates around a few dominant centralized exchanges, knowing where real liquidity sits and how it behaves, is essential for both retail and active traders.\n\n🔹 What Liquidity Means for Traders\nLiquidity is the ability to enter and exit positions quickly with minimal price impact. Highly liquid exchanges offer tight spreads, deep order books, and low slippage, even during volatility.\nCore assets like $BTC and  $ETH consistently show strong liquidity across top exchanges, making them ideal for large orders, hedging, and active strategies. They also anchor market depth and price discovery.\n\n🔹 Where Liquidity Is Concentrated in 2026\nDerivatives, especially perpetual futures, now account for most global crypto volume. #Binance,  #Bitget, and #ByBit  lead this segment with deep liquidity in $BTC and $ETH contracts.\nSpot liquidity is strongest on fiat- and institution-heavy platforms like Coinbase and Kraken, while KuCoin and MEXC offer wider access to mid-cap and emerging tokens, often with more variable depth.\n\n🔹 Choosing the Right Exchange\nReported volume alone isn’t enough. Traders should assess:\n\nOrder book depth near market price\n\nSpread stability during volatility\n\nBalance between spot and derivatives liquidity\n\n\nFor $BTC and $ETH, the deepest liquidity is typically found on large global exchanges, enabling efficient execution and lower costs. Aligning exchange liquidity with your trading style, spot or derivatives, is key to managing risk and performance.\n\nBottom line:\nIn 2026, crypto liquidity is driven by a small group of major exchanges and led by highly liquid assets such as $BTC and $ETH. Understanding these liquidity flows helps traders reduce slippage, navigate volatility, and trade with confidence.","gravity_id":"373075479","id":98896,"createdAt":"2026-01-21T14:10:04.408Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-21T14:20:04.658Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-21T14:03:01.080Z","text_content":"$ETH  – Breakdown or Fake Breakdown? 📉  The daily trend is clearly bearish, printing lower highs & lower lows.

This feels like one of the most interesting developments in crypto derivatives lately.  So here’s the deal: Bitget has rolled out RWA Index Perpetual Futures, which basically lets you trade tokenized real-world assets (like stocks and other securities) in a futures format using USDT. Instead of trading $BTC  or $ETH  futures, you’re trading indices composed of tokenized stocks from familiar global companies.  What I find exciting about this:  1. Bridging TradFi and DeFi - It’s a rare product where you can speculate on real-world asset prices on a crypto platform without needing a brokerage account or dealing with FX conversions. All you need is USDT.  2. 24/5 Trading with No Liquidations During Market Breaks – Unlike traditional stock markets that close on weekends and holidays, these futures trade nearly all week, and Bitget won’t liquidate your positions when markets are closed.  3. Diversified Price Index – The pricing comes from multiple token issuers instead of a single source, which should help with fairer price discovery and reduce the risk tied to one provider.  4. Long & Short Flexibility You can go long or short just like crypto futures, and reportedly it’s pretty easy to get started with.  Important note: This product is innovative but not risk-free. RWA futures involve speculative trading, and tokenized assets can still move sharply in price. Always do your research and only trade what you’re comfortable losing.  Personally, I think products like these could gradually reshape how retail traders interact with traditional asset classes especially if more exchanges or protocols start offering similar tokenized instruments. It’s cool to watch bridging happen in real time.  Would love to hear what others think.","gravity_id":"373073547","id":98926,"createdAt":"2026-01-21T14:20:02.774Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-21T14:40:05.238Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-21T14:10:03.694Z","text_content":"#Bhutan  To Run #SeiNetwork  Validator in Q1 2026\r  Bhutan will deploy and run a Sei Network validator in the first quarter through a collaboration between the Sei Development Foundation and Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), the country's primary sovereign wealth fund.

Wintermute shared a brief recap of 2025 and outlined potential paths for 2026. Their key takeaway: the market may be moving beyond the traditional 4-year cycle model.   2025 didn’t deliver the growth many expected, but it may mark a shift from pure speculation toward a more mature asset class. Historically, liquidity flowed from $BTC  to $ETH , then to large-cap alts, and finally into high-risk assets. That pattern is breaking.  The reason? ETFs and DATs. They bring steady institutional demand but don’t trigger broad liquidity rotation across the market. As a result, market structure is now driven more by capital flows and attention than by halving-based cycles.  Looking into 2026: ETFs and DATs continue to expand BTC and ETH remain primary beneficiaries Broader interest in crypto may return  So, 2026 will depend on whether liquidity can move beyond BTC and ETH.
