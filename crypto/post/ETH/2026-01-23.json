On paper, the upgrade did exactly what it was supposed to do. But JPMorgan is questioning how long this momentum can really last.  Fusaka expanded data capacity by increasing blobs per block, easing congestion and cutting transaction costs - especially for layer-2 networks. Short term, it worked. Long term, JPMorgan points out a familiar pattern: past Ethereum upgrades often delivered temporary rebounds that faded once the initial excitement wore off.  The bigger issue is competition. Activity continues to drift toward layer-2s like Base, Arbitrum and Optimism, with Base now generating the majority of L2 revenue. At the same time, faster and cheaper layer-1s like Solana keep pulling users and liquidity away.  Add fading speculation around NFTs, memecoins, and ICOs, plus app-specific chains like Uniswap and dYdX moving off mainnet, and the result is clear: lower fee burn, rising ETH supply, and pressure on ETH-denominated TVL.

This development further underscores the difference between the two assets, which are commonly equated as stores of value.    In an X post, analyst Lancaster. $ETH  pointed out the difference in the current price action between these two assets. He claimed that both assets can be classified as gold narratives, but only one is setting record Gold prices at all-time highs. He argued about what investors learn in times of macro uncertainty.  The broader macro #environment  has also been attributed to gold’s strength.

Hey, man—after the Fusaka upgrade, ETH really seemed to come back to life: fees dropped, activity surged, and everyone started talking about an Ethereum renaissance. But JPMorgan’s sending a reality check: don’t get ahead of yourself.  Sure, blockspace increased slightly, but the core issues haven’t gone anywhere. Most user activity has already migrated to L2s—Base alone now captures up to 70% of total revenue across the entire Ethereum L2 ecosystem. Solana and other chains keep luring users with speed and low costs. And crucially, that speculative frenzy that once flooded Ethereum with transactions—memecoins, NFTs, IDOs—is mostly gone or moved elsewhere.  Even giants like Uniswap and dYdX are launching their own chains—and succeeding! Liquidity is leaking out, ETH burn is declining, and so is the deflationary price pressure.  So yes, Fusaka was a solid step—but not a magic fix. History shows tech upgrades alone won’t save Ethereum if users and capital keep leaving.

The firm characterized 2026 as bringing \"brutal pruning\" to digital asset #treasuries .   Concentration patterns have emerged most clearly in $BTC  and $ETH  corporate holdings, where well-capitalized entities have dominated recent purchases. Pantera expects only a handful of major treasury operators will remain independent, with others absorbed by competitors or forced to exit positions.   BitMine, the largest corporate $ETH  holder, purchased 35,268 tokens for approximately $104 million in the week ending Tuesday. The company's total position reached 4.2 million $ETH  valued at $12.9 billion, representing roughly 3.5% of Ether's entire supply after acquiring 92,511 tokens worth $277 million since early January.   Hong Kong investment firm Trend Research has bought 41,500 $ETH  for about $126 million in 2026 so far. The firm finances purchases through decentralized borrowing on the Aave protocol rather than traditional equity or debt issuance, a funding approach unavailable to many competitors.   #Strategy , the Michael Saylor-led company, dominates $BTC  accumulation among public companies. The firm acquired 22,306 tokens last week for $2.13 billion, bringing total holdings to 709,715 $BTC  purchased for approximately $53.9 billion at an average cost of $75,979 per coin.   Corporate $BTC  #treasuries  collectively control about 1.13 million tokens according to Bitcoinquant data, roughly 5.4% of total supply. This growing #concentration  among a small group raises sustainability questions for smaller treasury operators, particularly those that financed purchases through debt or equity raises during earlier bull markets.","gravity_id":"373118780","id":102188,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T01:40:03.183Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T03:10:06.227Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-23T01:40:45.136Z","text_content":"It's WILD.\n\nETH's ATH last year was $4,946.\n\nAt the same time gold was trading at $3,371.\n\nToday, gold hit an ATH of $4,976. \n\nIf someone had told you then gold would be hitting $5k before ETH, you wouldn't have believed them. \n\nYet here we are.","gravity_id":"373118845","id":102197,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T01:50:02.827Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T03:40:05.753Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-23T02:07:45.041Z","text_content":"ethereum went from a leading chain to a place to park your assets via aave for yield\n\ni hope there is more to it than that. they need to onboard all wall st banks for their tokenisation efforts or risk becoming irrelevant","gravity_id":"373119742","id":102215,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T02:10:02.888Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T04:10:06.356Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-23T02:04:45.049Z","text_content":"Top markets on @MyriadMarkets this week include predictions on a new Bitcoin all-time high, the battle between gold and Ethereum, and Zcash's price. https://decrypt.co/355568/myriad-moves-bitcoin-bearishness-grows-gold-closer-beating-ethereum-5k","gravity_id":"373119717","id":102217,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T02:10:03.656Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T04:00:05.976Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-23T02:46:45.039Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\n「Lightning Network Backhand」 Whale Liquidates $ETH Long, Profits $120,000\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"373120290","id":102241,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T02:50:02.709Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T04:30:06.071Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-23T02:50:13.878Z","text_content":"Ethereum $ETH slipped to $2,962 (‑4.6%) following $229.95M in spot ETF outflows. 24h spot trading volume rose 58% to $34.3B; derivatives jumped 65% to $74.9B.

Some are great for beginners who want a simple buy button, while others are for pros who want complex tools.\n\nThe trick is finding a platform that keeps your money safe  while you buy #Crypto without charging you a fortune in hidden fees.\n\n\n1. Is a big name always better?\n✓ Big names like Coinbase are famous and easy to use, but they often charge much higher fees for that convenience.\n✓ On the other hand, platforms like Bitget or Binance offer way more features (like copying expert traders) and lower costs, but they can look a bit busy at first glance.\nReference here: https://www.bitget.com/academy/pros-and-cons-of-major-crypto-exchanges-how-to-choose-the-right-platform-review\n\n2. Are hidden fees eating your profit?\nMany people forget that every time you buy or sell, the exchange takes a tiny cut. If you trade often, those small fees add up to hundreds of dollars. Look for platforms that give you discounts if you hold their specific coin or if you trade in large amounts.\n\n3. How do I know my money is safe?\nThe best exchanges show Proof of Reserves which is a fancy way of proving they actually have your cash in the vault. You should also look for a Protection Fund, which is like an insurance policy that pays you back if the exchange ever gets hacked.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Don't rush in. Pick an exchange that fits your level.

Major providers like Bitget, Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, OKX, crypto(.)com, KuCoin, Bybit, Lido, and Rocket Pool differ in staking methods, rewards, lock-ups, and risk, making careful comparison essential.\n\nWhat should investors look at when choosing a staking platform ?\n\nBeyond headline APYs, investors should focus on flexibility, asset support, custody model, withdrawal terms, and risk exposure. The right platform depends on priorities such as convenience, liquidity, diversification, or self-custody.\n\nHow do major staking platforms differ in structure and features?\n\nCentralized platforms like Bitget, Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, KuCoin, and Bybit are easier to use Bitget and Binance offer broad assets and flexible options, Coinbase and Kraken focus on simplicity and security, OKX and KuCoin target advanced or altcoin users, and Bybit suits short-term yield seekers.\n\nDecentralized platforms like Lido and Rocket Pool provide non-custodial, liquid   $ETH staking, catering to DeFi enthusiasts and users who value decentralization.\n\nHow do rewards, lock-up terms, and risks compare across platforms?\n\nRewards are shaped by lock-up periods and platform design. Centralized platforms balance flexible and fixed staking, while decentralized options offer liquid staking with added smart contract risk.\n\nWhich type of investor suits each staking platform best?\n\nCentralized platforms suit users seeking ease of use, hybrids fit users exploring Web3, and decentralized protocols appeal to investors who value control and decentralization.\n\nConclusion\n\nStaking remains a strong yield strategy  but platform choice is critical. Differences in custody, flexibility, and risk mean each platform serves a specific purpose. Aligning these trade-offs with personal goals leads to better long-term results.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #ETH","gravity_id":"373128740","id":102850,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T11:10:04.701Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T11:20:04.139Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-23T11:11:55.152Z","text_content":"$ETH Technical Analysis: Momentum Shift\n\n\nThe short-term market structure for Ethereum has flipped.

With better transparency, execution speed, and risk tools, it now suits beginners and busy investors.  What is copy trading?  Users select a lead trader and trades are mirrored proportionally.

However, if there is a liquidity grab below 2906.02 or even a quick sweep towards 2866.11, followed by a sharp bullish reversal (like a pin bar or engulfing candle on the 15m/1h), I would expect a bounce back toward 2967.59 and possibly testing 2984.71. - Example long setup: Wait for price to dip below 2906.02, see a strong bullish reversal candle or pattern, and enter long once price closes back above 2906.02. First take profit at 2931.06, second take profit at 2967.59. Place stop-loss just below the swing low set by the manipulation (for example, below 2866.11). - If price breaks and closes below 2866.11 with no reversal, this would invalidate the long setup and suggest further downside, possibly towards 2840 or lower. - For shorts, look for price to rally into 2931.06 or 2984.71 and show clear signs of rejection (like a bearish engulfing or failure to make a highe...  📊 Get detailed free analysis of any coin on any timeframe you want.

As ETH slipped toward $2,900, liquidation pressure spread across the market, even while $BTC  held relatively steadier and traders reacted to fresh regulatory uncertainty from Washington.  ETH has now lost the $3,170–$3,200 support zone and is down over 10% on the week. That breakdown helped trigger a broader liquidation wave, with total forced losses reaching roughly $197M as risk appetite faded.  Here’s what’s driving the pressure 👇  • $ETH   confirmed a technical breakdown, accelerating liquidations • Bitcoin dominance appears to be losing momentum as the value gap narrows • DOGE slid to ~$0.12, with longs making up ~84% of $1.64M in liquidations  Regulatory fog is adding stress, not clarity.
