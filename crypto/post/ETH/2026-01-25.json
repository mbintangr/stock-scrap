Price action is consolidating above a rising trendline, and the structure suggests potential for a bullish continuation if key levels are reclaimed.  Technical Breakdown Trend: Short-term uptrend intact, supported by ascending trendline from recent lows.  Support Zone: $2,780–$2,891 — this grey zone has held through recent dips and continues to act as a demand base.  Current Price: $2,951 — sitting just above support and inside the lower edge of the blue target zone.  Target Zone: $3,377–$3,435 — marked in blue, this area aligns with previous supply and could be tested if bulls reclaim momentum.  Major Resistance: $4,800 — long-term ceiling from previous cycle highs.  📈 Bullish Scenario A sustained close above $2,951, followed by a push through $3,000, could trigger a move toward the $3,377–$3,435 zone.  Volume confirmation and strong candles (e.g., bullish engulfing, breakout bars) would strengthen the case for continuation.  ⚠️ Bearish Risk If price fails to hold above $2,891, a breakdown toward $2,780 or even $2,624 could follow.  Watch for weakening volume or rejection candles near resistance.  📊 Market Context Recent analysis confirms Ethereum is in a consolidation phase, with $2,700 acting as a strong base and $3,000 as a key resistance. On-chain signals and ETF inflows suggest institutional interest is growing, which supports a bullish bias.  👉 What’s your take — will $ETH   reclaim $3,000 and push toward $3,400, or is this just a pause before another leg down? #BTC Price Analysis#  #ETH  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373178100","id":106047,"createdAt":"2026-01-25T00:50:03.183Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-25T03:00:05.119Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-25T01:07:45.048Z","text_content":"💸 Just when you thought $ETH was just for memes, they’ve launched a $1M Post-Quantum Security team! 🛡️ Future-proofing or overthinking? 🤔 #Crypto #Ethereum #Blockchain #QuantumSecurity https://cryptodailyalert.com/ethereum-post-quantum-security-initiative ","gravity_id":"373178254","id":106061,"createdAt":"2026-01-25T01:10:02.900Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-25T03:10:06.081Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-25T01:17:29.067Z","text_content":"$ETH will go down on the weekly.
