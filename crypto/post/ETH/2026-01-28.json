Some platforms do not submit user data or issue tax forms. But that does not make crypto activity tax-free.

CMC Research reviewed YTD ETF flow data and found a market behaving in contradictions: sudden surges of aggressive buying, sharper and more decisive waves of selling, and an unusually high concentration of conviction in a narrow slice of products.\n\nBeneath the surface, the numbers tell a story that’s far less bullish:\n\nKey Takeaway #1: The Tape Says “Risk Off”\nDespite pockets of enthusiasm, the dominant signal is capital leaving the system.\n\nTotal net flows across all analyzed funds stand at –$354.2 mil in the last month, signaling a meaningful withdrawal of capital, and it points to investors actively reducing exposure rather than passively reallocating.\n\nEven more telling is how concentrated the exits are. Just three ETFs: GBTC, ETHA, and FBTC, account for ~$1.34 billion of outflows, or roughly 92% of the total outflows. When capital exits cluster this tightly, it’s usually a sign of institutional repositioning rather than retail churn.\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) at -$757.20M, followed by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) at -$408.10M, and the 21Shares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) at -$175.60M. The outflows from major Bitcoin vehicles like GBTC and FBTC suggest significant profit-taking or rotation among institutional investors.\n\nKey Takeaway #2: Bitcoin Is Being Sold—Ethereum Is Being Chosen\n\nThe outflows are not evenly distributed. They are overwhelmingly driven by Bitcoin-linked products, while a small group of Ethereum vehicles quietly absorbs new capital.\n\nLargest BTC outflows:\n🔹 Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC):-$757.20M\n🔹 Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC): -$408.10M\n🔹 Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB): -$48.90M\n\nThe exits from flagship Bitcoin ETFs suggest profit-taking, de-risking, or rotation particularly among larger allocators who tend to move first and move size.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, funds attracted capital inflows are overwhelmingly focused on Ethereum:\n🔹 Grayscale Ethereum Staking ETF Shares (ETH): $147.10M\n🔹 Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH): $87.00M\n\nAlthough this inflow has been offset by the large outflow from 21Shares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) -$175.60M.\n\nBitcoin inflows do exist but they’re highly concentrated. IBIT topped with $760.60M inflows, and the next BTC-linked product in the top inflow list is Bitwise Bitcoin ETF at +$40.5M. The message is clear: interest hasn’t vanished, but conviction has narrowed.\n\nSummary\n\nJanuary’s ETF flows are not telling a simple “bull vs. bear” story. They’re signaling rotation, selectivity, and rising discrimination among investors.\n\nCapital is leaving Bitcoin ETFs at scale. Ethereum is quietly gaining favor. And beneath it all, the net result is still a sizable withdrawal of risk capital.\n\nWhen inflows look strong but totals are deeply negative, markets are usually transitioning instead of trending. That’s the signal January leaves behind.","gravity_id":"373277793","id":106834,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T13:30:02.727Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T13:40:04.581Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-28T13:27:43.656Z","text_content":"🚨 BREAKING:\n\n\nBLACKROCK JUST STARTED LIQUIDIATING CRYPTO AHEAD OF FED INTEREST RATE DECISION TODAY\n\n\nTHEY ARE NON-STOP DUMPING $BTC AND $ETH EVERY FEW MINUTES\n\n\nLOOKS LIKE HUGE DUMP IS COMING...\n\n\nMeanwhile BingX New Year 1st Fortune Event (Phase 2 Now Live)\n\n\nBingX rolled out a New Year event to kick off 2026, and Phase 2 of the Solo Trading Contest is officially live.

After recent volatility, $ETH  continues to defend a key demand zone and has avoided a deeper breakdown, even after briefly losing short-term momentum levels. Failed downside continuation typically signals absorption, not weakness.  On relative terms, ETH/BTC reinforces this view. After dipping below ~0.052 BTC, the pair quickly reclaimed the level and compressed back into range. No lower lows are forming - selling pressure against Bitcoin is fading rather than accelerating.  This price stability aligns with evolving supply dynamics. Ethereum’s active wallet count has reached 175.5M, with 5.16M new wallets added in 2026, indicating expanding participation despite muted price action. Liquid ETH supply continues to decline as more tokens move into staking and long-term holdings, reducing fast-rotating supply.  Treasury accumulation adds another layer. BitMine Immersion now holds ~4.24M ETH, equal to 3.52% of total supply, after adding 40,302 ETH in a single day. This is balance-sheet accumulation, not tactical trading, and it permanently removes supply from circulation.  ETH is holding because sell-side pressure is weakening while long-term supply tightens. With exchange balances falling and institutional absorption rising, renewed demand could meet a thinner market. A sustained push opens $3,450–$3,500, with extension toward $3,700–$3,800.

THE MAIN EVENT: Federal Reserve Decision (Tonight)\n​The Catalyst: The Federal Reserve is set to announce its interest rate decision (2:00 PM NY time).\n​Why We Are Pumping: The market is pricing in a \"Dovish Hold\" or a potential surprise cut. Traders are buying now because they believe Jerome Powell will announce that inflation is officially defeated, which would send #Bitcoin  rocketing past $92,000 instantly.\n​Risk: This is a \"Buy the Rumor\" pump. Be very careful of a \"Sell the News\" dump if Powell sounds even slightly strict.\n​2. \"Super Earnings\" Day (Tech Correlation)\n​The News: Today is the biggest earnings day for the US Stock Market. Tech giants Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla are reporting earnings.  \n​The Connection: Bitcoin is currently highly correlated with Tech Stocks. Wall Street expects massive AI profits from these companies. As tech stocks rally in the pre-market, they are dragging Bitcoin and Ethereum up with them.\n​Specific Mover: Tesla earnings are rumored to include updates on their Bitcoin holdings, adding fuel to the fire.\n​3. Ethereum \"Staking\" Narrative (SharpLink News)\n​The Update: While Bitcoin fights for $90k, Ethereum is seeing a specific pump today.\n​The Trigger: News broke that SharpLink Gaming (a major corporate holder) generated massive staking rewards (over 12,000   $ETH total), validating the \"Corporate Treasury\" use case for ETH.\n​Price Action: ETH is attempting to break the $2,985 resistance level right now.\n​4. Institutional \"Dip Buying\" (BlackRock)\n​The Data: On-chain reports from this morning show that institutional flows into BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF have turned positive again after a slow week.\n​Significance: Smart Money used the dip to $88,000 earlier this week to reload. Now that price is back near $90,000, retail traders are FOMO-ing back in, causing this intraday pump.\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373283327","id":107072,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T15:10:03.434Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T15:30:04.065Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-28T15:02:14.364Z","text_content":"$ETH  — ASCENDING CHANNEL CONTINUES WITH BUYERS IN CONTROL  Ethereum remains well-supported inside a rising channel after reclaiming key structure around 2,950.

Investors are focused less on the headline numbers alone and more on forward guidance, particularly commentary around energy storage growth, AI and autonomous development, and overall profitability trends.   If results surprise to the upside, $TSLA   could break above key resistance, shifting market structure and potentially triggering short covering alongside fresh buying interest, turning the recent consolidation phase into a continuation setup.  At the same time, the broader risk asset environment shows cautious stability, with $ETH   trading around the $3,000 psychological zone, reflecting consolidation and selective optimism across crypto markets. Similar to TSLA, $ETH ’s next directional move likely depends on confirmation above key technical levels rather than speculation alone. Because earnings driven moves can be fast and volatile, some traders prefer instruments that allow them to position around both upside and downside scenarios with defined risk.   That’s one reason a few traders are participating in the Bitget Stock Futures Championship, using stock futures to capitalize on $TSLA   price movement without committing to long term equity exposure. Regardless of platform, the key remains the same: wait for confirmation, manage risk tightly, and let price, not hype, validate the move.

This isn’t euphoria — it’s positioning.  \r \r BTC strength at these levels usually isn’t retail-led. It’s driven by sustained ETF demand, corporate balance-sheet exposure, and long-term capital treating Bitcoin as a macro hedge. At the same time, miner behavior points to tightening supply: fewer coins hitting exchanges, more conviction to hold, and a structure that supports higher prices even during quiet sessions.  \r \r Ethereum, meanwhile, is doing what it often does early in expansion cycles — consolidating while capital concentrates in Bitcoin. ETH around $3K reflects reduced liquid supply from staking and short-term caution from institutions, not weakness. Historically, this phase tends to precede rotation once BTC establishes dominance.\r \r  Zooming out, liquidity is clearly returning. Stablecoin activity is picking up, derivatives are active but not overheated, and long-term holders remain patient. That combination usually supports continuation, even if volatility increases near psychological levels.  \r \r Bottom line: Bitcoin is setting the pace for this cycle. Ethereum is building underneath it. The spread between them isn’t a warning — it’s a signal of where we are in the rotation timeline.  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Ethereum  #Altcoin Season#  #ETH","gravity_id":"373283752","id":107236,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T16:30:03.479Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T16:50:03.215Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-28T16:21:47.356Z","text_content":"This setup on $ETH  is still valid.
