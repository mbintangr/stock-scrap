They held interest rates at 3.5%–3.75% after three rate cuts last fall. This pause in easing tells us the macro environment is shifting, and markets are waiting for the next big move.  At the same time, the tech sector is waking up.  Meta posted strong Q4 earnings, beat expectations, and gave solid sales guidance. The stock jumped up to 10% in after-hours trading. Moves like this don’t wait for anyone.  This is where strategy and access matter. I was able to react early through Bitget Stock Futures, which trade 24/7. In traditional markets, this kind of opportunity would have been missed because the market was closed.  So even when crypto feels slow, opportunities are happening in stocks and other markets.

That means one-third of all DeFi TVL is on Aave. \nIn the lending sector, dominance is even higher. Aave is larger than every other competitor combined. \nIn 2025, \"trillions\" was more than a meme as the protocol crossed $3 trillion in all-time assets supplied. \nAave's multi-chain strategy thrived as it became the first DeFi protocol to reach $1 billion TVL across six networks simultaneously. \nAave was the default destination for the most in-demand onchain assets, providing billions in liquidity. \nMost impressively, at its peak TVL, the protocol would rank among the top 50 U.S. banks by size. \nThe Aave effect was on full display in 2025, helping partners like @ethena_labs, @maplefinance, @Ripple, and @Plasma grow to billions. \nUSDe by @ethena_labs was one of 2025’s fastest-growing stablecoins,  fueled by its native yield and the Aavethena partnership.\n\nAt peak, Aave held over 50% of Ethena's stablecoin supply through USDe, sUSDe, and sUSDe @pendle_fi PTs. \nsyrupUSDT by @maplefinance debuted on Aave in Q4 2025. By the end of the year, over 70% of the supply was earning yield in the @plasma and @ethereum Core markets. \nStables that bet on Aave thrive. @ripple's RLUSD grew from $250 million circulating supply to $1.3 billion after onboarding to the @ethereum Core market and Horizon. \nThe Aave effect isn’t just for assets, it's for networks too. When @plasma launched last September, it attracted $1.3 billion in the first hour.\n\nJust 48 hours later, deposits reached $6.6 billion. \nIn 2025, embedded DeFi was the leading trend, with partners ranging from LatAm consumer apps to embedded wallet infrastructure, all supporting Aave. \nOne of Aave's core business lines, @GHO, also had quite a year, tripling its total supply throughout 2025. \nHorizon, Aave's RWA market, became the largest and fastest-growing venue for RWA-backed loans in DeFi in less than 6 months. \nOne of the most significant DeFi announcements of the year was Aave App, a consumer-focused mobile savings app powered by the Aave protocol. \nLast but not least, after two years of development, Aave V4 was deployed on the testnet.\n\nIt introduces a new architecture, allowing Aave to expand beyond onchain collateral and paving the way for new DeFi lending use cases.\n\nV4 will launch on mainnet in 2026. \nAs we kick off 2026, Aave is uniquely positioned to bring the next trillion dollars and millions of users onchain through Aave V4, Horizon, and the Aave App. \nWe'd like to extend a massive thank you DAO service providers, delegates, partners, users, and the rest of the Aave ecosystem for their contributions last year.\n\nAave will win. \nRead the full recap here: https://aave.com/blog/aave-2025-recap","gravity_id":"373321191","id":109949,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T19:00:03.681Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T19:10:04.964Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-29T18:55:45.099Z","text_content":"Wall Street is going on-chain.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange is launching a blockchain-enabled, 24/7 venue for tokenised equities, while firms like Strategy and Bitmine Immersion add BTC and ETH as long-term reserves - signalling steady adoption. \nTokenised equities are moving from theory to reality.\n\nRead more 👇\nhttps://blog.bitfinex.com/bitfinex-alpha/bitfinex-alpha-in-the-absence-of-spot-demand-btc-is-drifting/","gravity_id":"373319360","id":109950,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T19:00:03.863Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T19:10:05.284Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-29T18:55:16.662Z","text_content":"#ETH  / $ETH  moved exactly as expected 🎯   \r \r Glad I could warn the community ahead of time.   \r \r Hit follow here, on X/ @ero_crypto / for such TA and calls./","gravity_id":"373321182","id":109951,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T19:00:04.079Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T19:10:05.617Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-29T19:09:19.093Z","text_content":"$ETH  So it happened.

Thin order books amplified the move.\n ・This was not a “crypto-only” event: broad risk-off hit simultaneously (metals and equities), and crypto simply reacted with higher beta.\n ・Spot demand remains weak (especially during U.S. hours), so price action becomes more futures-led and more violent.\n ・Long liquidations cascaded, and the post-dump environment tends to invite “dip-buy OI rebuild,” keeping volatility elevated.\n ・Spot BTC ETF flows are still net-negative, making rebounds harder to sustain unless flows flip.\n ・Capital rotation remains polarized: risk assets may rebound, but BTC can lag if its specific flows stay weak.\n ・Stablecoin supply decline is still ambiguous: it could be “fiat exit” or “rail migration.” The key is timing (e.g., ETH down vs Tron up).\n ・Conclusion: This looks less like structural collapse and more like a liquidity-driven liquidation shock.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOn-chain & Technical Trends\n ・Open interest can rebuild quickly after a dump; that’s exactly why “bounce = safe” is a dangerous assumption (re-liquidation risk).\n ・This is a cost-basis reset phase: short-term direction is driven more by positioning quality (OI/funding/liquidations) than narratives.\n ・If the Coinbase premium stays weak, rebounds are more likely to be short-covering than true spot-led recovery.\n ・Key levels: the ~$84K area is the immediate battlefield. If a breakdown “sticks,” next focus is ~$81K; deeper stress brings ~$70K and, in worst cases, the 200-week MA zone into view.\n ・At the same time, a lower SSR suggests dry powder may still be waiting inside the crypto ecosystem (not a full exit), meaning time-based basing remains possible.\n ・ETH shows improving fundamentals (lower L1 costs, stronger deployment activity), but price can still be dominated by risk-off flow conditions.\n ・Treat miner/supply noise (hashrate/difficulty disruptions) as short-term volatility drivers; prioritize flow for trend decisions.\n ・Conclusion: The market cannot “earn” an uptrend via leverage. It needs spot flows (ETF/spot volume/stablecoin net growth).\n―――――――――――――――――――\nSentiment\n ・Fear & Greed remains in “Fear,” reinforcing cautious positioning and fragile confidence.\n ・Near-extreme fear can spark sharp bounces, but with thin liquidity those bounces tend to be messy and short-lived.\n ・Low retail interest (volume/search weakness) implies “absence” more than “capitulation,” which often increases whipsaws.\n ・Scattered whale panic sells can contribute to a bottoming process, but are not enough while liquidation dynamics remain dominant.\n ・When downside hedges are crowded, headlines can trigger “surprise rallies,” but sustainability still depends on flows.\n ・Political risk (U.S. shutdown) and geopolitical headlines can easily re-ignite fear.\n ・Conclusion: Emotion is near a local low, but “low fear” is not the same as “uptrend.” Flow confirmation comes first.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nU.S. Traditional Markets\n ・U.S. equities moved lower; tech weakness amplified risk-off.\n ・Microsoft-driven sell pressure fed into broader risk sentiment, tightening financial conditions at the margin.\n ・Gold and silver experienced unusually large moves, reminding markets that even “safe assets” can unwind fast under leverage.\n ・DXY remains a key pivot (around the mid-96s region); dollar weakness does not automatically translate into risk-on here.\n ・Shutdown risk remains a live uncertainty; political headlines are directly adding volatility.\n ・Geopolitics can keep energy/inflation concerns alive, which can work against risk assets.\n ・Conclusion: BTC traded inside a messy macro mix (equities/metals/oil/politics), and crypto’s thin liquidity made it the most amplified.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOverall Assessment\nToday was a textbook “no-bid + liquidation cascade” day, with downside exaggerated by thin liquidity. Rather than calling it a definitive structural bear regime, it’s more accurate to frame it as a return to leverage-dominant price discovery after a macro-driven shock. Sustainable recovery requires ETF flow stabilization, spot volume recovery, and evidence that stablecoin liquidity is bottoming and re-expanding.\nKey watchpoints today: Can BTC reclaim and hold ~$84K–$85K? Do ETF flows improve (and does BTC continue to lag ETH/SOL)? Is OI rebuild “healthy reset” or “fuel for the next liquidation”? Does Fear & Greed stabilize? And can the market absorb DXY/political shutdown headlines without renewed selling?","gravity_id":"373322194","id":110215,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T21:10:03.685Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T21:40:04.853Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-29T21:19:51.900Z","text_content":"$ETH They are deleting messages that mention the price falling, leaving only messages about it rising.

Important levels: $80,000 and $90,000.  #Bitcoin  Overview: Over the past few days, the price of $BTC  has fallen by more than 6% and approached the key level of $80,000. Currently, the price continues to decline smoothly, during which it may reach the previous low of $80,600 and touch the key level of $80,000.   If the price of $BTC  shows a good reaction to these levels, it will have the potential to form an upward structure. The main target for price recovery is the imbalance zone between $85,600 and $87,700, as well as the key level of $90,000.  #Altcoin  Overview: The #altcoins  market is falling in line with the price of $BTC  . Right now, for $ETH  to reverse its price trend, it is important to stay above the $2,700 level to prevent further decline.

Bitcoin and Ethereum dominated the selloff: $780M in $BTC  and $414M in $ETH  were forcibly closed, making up nearly 70% of total liquidations. Two-thirds of losses came from overcrowded long positions, highlighting how bullish leverage had become after weeks of low volatility.  Altcoins weren’t spared, with high-beta and mid-cap tokens accounting for roughly a third of liquidation volume, often amplified by thin liquidity rather than fundamental weakness.  The liquidation wave coincided with sentiment deterioration: the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropped to 28 (“Fear”), reflecting defensive positioning as traders reacted to forced closures.  Markets are now recalibrating - futures open interest has cooled, leverage is down, and volatility remains elevated.

This wasn't organic distribution; it was a high-velocity liquidation cascade that punished over-leveraged longs.  The Fallout by the Numbers:  $1.69 Billion in total liquidations within 24 hours.  $BTC : ~$783M wiped out.  $ETH : ~$416M flushed.  Human Cost: Over 269,000 traders were forced out of their positions.  Market Context: Bitcoin is currently fighting to hold the $82K region after losing critical support levels. Ethereum has slipped under $2.8K, while heavy hitters like SOL and XRP are seeing double-digit weekly retracements. We are officially back in BTC Dominance mode, with the Altcoin Season Index hovering in the low 30s.  Technical Breakdown:  📍Momentum: BTC has broken down from its consolidation range. MACD is deeply negative, and RSI is sitting near 30 (oversold).  📍Volume: We are seeing high-volume \"red candles,\" confirming that sellers - and forced liquidations - are currently in control.  📍The Floor: The $80K-$78K zone is now the line in the sand. Reclaiming this could spark a relief bounce, but losing it opens the door to a much deeper correction.  The Takeaway: \"Oversold\" does not mean \"bottom.\" In a leverage-driven flush, price can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

We are witnessing the production and confirmation of a higher low. 30-January 2026 vs 21-November 2025. A true higher low I should say this time.\n\nThe low 21-November was $2,623. The low today $2,689. This is technically a double-bottom. The price is too close to the last low but the higher low signal still valid remains. It can be read in both ways.\n\nOn a daily basis, trading volume has been dropping since November 4.\n\nWhat to expect?\n\nWithin the last 24 hours, $1.67B worth of long positions have been liquidated. The signal that I've been mentioning for the bulls also works in reverse. That is, when the market liquidates $1.2B worth of shorts within 24 hours, we know the bulls are in.\n\nThe fact that we have this much liquidations, $1.67B in just a single day, reveals the retrace is over. The bulls have been liquidated, the market can go up next.\n\nThe exchanges will use all the profits they made through selling and loaning and fees to buy everything at bottom prices, at the current market low. This low is the lowest possible, the exchanges know. Many people are not able to buy because of the recent move but the exchanges can, they buy everything at the low and prop up the market. When prices are really high, the same situation with the long positions will be repeated with the shorts.\n\nRemember, we trade against exchanges not other people, and the exchanges have all of our information and hold all the coins. The way to beat the exchanges is to buy spot focusing on the long-term.\n\nEthereum continues to be bullish, market conditions have not changed.\n\nWe have an even better entry price now. Prepare for massive growth. \n\n\n\nNamaste.","gravity_id":"373343411","id":111718,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T12:40:02.520Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T12:50:04.230Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-30T12:32:56.583Z","text_content":"$ETHd","gravity_id":"373349744","id":111719,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T12:40:02.848Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T12:50:04.414Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-30T12:29:41.926Z","text_content":"A steady downside movement has been happening on $ETH  after the last touch to the $3,400 resistance area, where currently the price is sitting slightly above the smaller support area, where buyers are still holding the dominance over this zone.

What to know:      Bitcoin's  implied volatility spiked sharply this week, with Deribit's DVOL index jumping from about 37 to above 44 as markets sold off.     The rise in DVOL and parallel move in the VIX reflect a broader risk-off environment, though bitcoin's implied volatility remains moderate by historical standards, with an IV Rank of 36 and IV Percentile near 50.     Options markets are signaling caution rather than panic after more than $1.7 billion in bullish crypto positions were liquidated, underscoring fragile positioning and expectations for more turbulence ahead.  Bitcoin's  $BTC  volatility spiked hard during Thursday's massive sell-off as traders rushed for downside protection.  Deribit’s bitcoin volatility index, known as DVOL, jumped sharply, rising from around 37 to above 44. DVOL is crypto’s closest equivalent to Wall Street’s VIX, a fear gauge, tracking how much price movement traders expect over the next 30 days based on options pricing. jwp-player-placeholder  When DVOL rises, it means traders are paying up for protection, options are become more expensive and fear is increasing.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date.

The breakdown below the critical $2,800 support zone has shifted the short-term bias from \"consolidation\" to \"bearish distribution.\"  The Technical Reality The Breakdown: Losing $2,800 has flipped that former floor into a formidable resistance. We are now seeing an increase in sell volume as long positions are flushed.  Support Levels: The next major demand zone sits at $2,500 (the 200-week MA). If this fails, the high-timeframe \"value area\" at $2,100–$2,200 becomes the likely target.  ETF Friction: ETH ETFs saw $155.6M in net outflows yesterday. Institutional demand is currently lagging behind BTC as investors grapple with the complexity of ETH's 2026 upgrade roadmap.  Fundamental Silver Lining: ERC-8004 Despite the price action, Ethereum just reached a massive infra milestone. The ERC-8004 \"Trustless Agents\" standard went live on mainnet yesterday.  This provides a \"blockchain passport\" for AI agents, allowing for portable reputation and verified identity.  As AI-to-AI commerce scales, Ethereum is positioning itself as the universal trust layer for the machine economy.  The 2026 Roadmap All eyes are on the Glamsterdam Fork (mid-2026), which aims to introduce parallel transaction processing. This is the \"speed\" catalyst needed to bridge the gap between ETH and high-throughput competitors like Solana.  Expert Verdict: We are in a structural \"reset\" phase. While the $2,500 retest seems imminent, the long-term case for ETH as the back-end of AI and institutional DeFi remains unparalleled.  Buying the $2,500 dip or waiting for a $2,800 reclaim?

For example, the largest cryptocurrencies showed the following performance:\n\n🔽 BTC −6.45%\n🔽 ETH −7.36%\n🔽 SOL −7.11%\n\n🔹 At the same time, a significant portion of cryptocurrencies in the top 100 and top 200 fell by double-digit percentages, confirming the high level of market stress.\n\n🔹 Even gold, traditionally considered a safe asset, recorded a decline of around 6%.\n\n⚡️ As a result, ULTIMA showed only a minimal decline — approximately 3%, demonstrating strong resilience amid the broader market downturn.\n\n🔥 This performance confirms that ULTIMA remains one of the most resilient digital assets globally during periods of high volatility, supported by a strong ecosystem, robust technological infrastructure, and a scarcity-driven supply model.\n\n#ULTIMA #CRYPTO #BTC #GOLD #TRADING","gravity_id":"373354914","id":112329,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T17:10:02.831Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T17:40:05.302Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-30T17:13:54.415Z","text_content":"$ETH  Buy Bitlight Offically Pacts🚨","gravity_id":"373356654","id":112351,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T17:20:02.617Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T17:50:04.886Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-30T17:13:45.180Z","text_content":"Vitalik Buterin Withdraws $44.7M in ETH to Support Ethereum Growth Through ‘Mild Austerity’\nhttps://decrypt.co/356490/vitalik-buterin-withdraws-44-7m-in-eth-to-support-ethereum-growth-through-mild-austerity?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=auto","gravity_id":"373355646","id":112352,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T17:20:02.953Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T17:50:05.220Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-30T17:13:45.077Z","text_content":"Ethereum staking hits all time high with 30% of all ETH now staked.\nJust in time for Lido V3","gravity_id":"373356647","id":112353,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T17:20:03.289Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T17:50:05.568Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-30T17:39:46.855Z","text_content":"Ethereum $ETH  is in a tough spot, trading below $2,800 and struggling to find support at $2,700.

But before we let the \"Fear\" label take over, let’s look at what’s actually happening:  🔍 Bitcoin ($83,390): We’ve pulled back from those $100K dreams for a moment. But look at the RSI (near 31) - we are getting very close to oversold territory. In crypto, Fear at these technical levels often acts as a precursor to finding a solid floor.  🔍 Ethereum ($2,730): $ETH  is testing its foundations. While $2,600 is the key level to watch, the trading volume shows people are reshuffling their bags, not just dumping them.  Why it’s not time to panic: This isn't a forced liquidation party: there’s no chaotic selling. It’s just a defensive, risk-off mood. The market is basically clearing out the noise and the over-leveraged positions.  🌈 Historically, some of the best opportunities have appeared exactly when the index hits these fear zones. Stay patient, keep an eye on those BTC & $ETH  support levels, and remember: the sun always comes out after the rain.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"373358095","id":112379,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T17:40:03.248Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T17:50:04.500Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-30T17:29:46.423Z","text_content":"$ETH  Dumping Hard down 4%🔻🔻🔻🔻\r \r #eth  #BTCUSD","gravity_id":"373355744","id":112380,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T17:40:03.589Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T17:50:04.692Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-30T17:40:48.971Z","text_content":"$ETH I think there is no place for humans in the crypto world with bots , we will just be a victim, Stop the loss now and get away.","gravity_id":"373357368","id":112403,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T17:50:03.110Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T17:50:03.110Z"}]
