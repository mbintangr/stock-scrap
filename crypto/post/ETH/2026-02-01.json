Users need confidence that they can act quickly and reliably when markets move, without being blocked by congestion or unpredictable costs.  STONfi contributes to this confidence by operating on TON, where performance characteristics align with frequent interaction. The result is a DeFi environment that feels responsive rather than fragile. Over time, this consistency shapes user behavior more effectively than high-yield incentives ever could.

But the real shockwave comes from unverified reports circulating in industry circles: Chinese research labs may have achieved synthetic gold and silver production.  If these claims turn out to be true, even partially the implications are massive: -Gold and silver prices could face unprecedented downward pressure. -The global metals market, already fragile, could be thrown into chaos. -Central banks and institutional holders would be forced to reassess their reserve strategies.  For now, nothing is confirmed. But the market is already whispering.  Meanwhile in Crypto: Bitcoin’s Bear Cycle May Be Just Beginning According to the classic 4‑year cycle timing, Bitcoin may only be at the early stages of its bear market. Historically, BTC tends to peak after a halving, then grind down for 12–18 months before bottoming.  If the cycle repeats: -More downside could be ahead -Macro uncertainty + metals volatility could amplify BTC’s weakness -Accumulation zones may still be months away  In short: Precious metals are unstable, Bitcoin is entering a deeper correction, and global markets are bracing for impact.  Stay sharp. The next few months could reshape everything from commodities to crypto.  #Macro Insights#   #Bitcoin  #BTC  $BTC  $ETH  #Gold  #Silver","gravity_id":"373388562","id":114727,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T18:20:03.277Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T18:30:04.797Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-31T18:27:37.341Z","text_content":"ETH got rekt AGAIN! 😭  This is why you don’t trust your transaction history, people, seriously.

Market sentiment stayed firmly risk-off, reflected in falling funding rates, and even major assets briefly traded with negative funding—showing reduced risk appetite across derivatives markets. • Hyperliquid saw a surge in open interest as demand for commodity exposure climbed, with HIP-3 OI hitting a new all-time high of $790M. • Ethereum ($ETH ) formed a Post-Quantum (PQ) team to develop long-term strategies for network protection against quantum computing risks. • Pendle rolled out its Algorithmic Incentive Model (AIM), adjusting emissions allocation based on each pool’s contribution, measured via swap fees and TVL. Overall, $BTC  and $ETH  continue to navigate high volatility, while innovation and structural upgrades in the crypto ecosystem keep the market evolving.  ﻿Join us on Telegram: t.me/AlphaCryptoSignal  ﻿#CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#  #CMC Smart Quests#  #Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373392104","id":114866,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T19:20:04.292Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T19:30:04.729Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-31T19:15:21.951Z","text_content":"$ETH   On January 30, 2026, I saw US Ethereum ETFs had a net outflow of $252.87 million,   https://transscreen.ru/en/CMK_news29694 and that caught my attention.","gravity_id":"373392095","id":114867,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T19:20:04.495Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T19:20:04.495Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-31T19:13:15.347Z","text_content":"#ETH  / $ETH   followed my bearish scenario perfectly . 🎯  Hit follow here and on X/ @ero_crypto/ for such calls and TA./","gravity_id":"373391381","id":114868,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T19:20:04.704Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T19:20:04.704Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-31T19:12:53.351Z","text_content":"🔥 TOM LEE IS DOWN $6 BILLION ON ETH  BitMine’s #Ethereum  position is now sitting on an estimated $6,000,000,000 unrealized loss.

Stop-loss should be placed above the swing high of this relief rally. - If you want to long, the safest scenario is to wait for manipulation or a fakeout below the most recent low, followed by a clear bullish reversal with strong lower timeframe confirmation.

Big banks openly said they need crypto infrastructure to stay competitive - and that matters for what comes next. Even as $BTC  cooled, institutions weren’t leaving crypto… they were repositioning.  💡 Here’s the part many missed. While BTC and $ETH  ETFs saw short-term outflows, capital rotated into altcoin ETFs. Solana and XRP products picked up interest, and Bitcoin ETFs still absorbed a net ~605,000 BTC in just 2.5 weeks. This wasn’t risk-off - it was selective.  Now zoom out: the ETF pipeline keeps expanding. Solana, XRP, Avalanche, Chainlink, SUI, and Hedera all have filings in play. JP Morgan already launched a stablecoin on Base, and BlackRock chose Ethereum-based rails for tokenization. Utility is winning over hype.  Why it matters: this cycle looks different  institutions want payment rails, RWAs, and stablecoins - not memes  ETF access is funneling capital into top-tier alts  ETH, SOL, and XRP sit right at that intersection  My question: are we watching the early rotation into the next leaders… or is the market still underpricing how big this shift could be?  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373396158","id":115191,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T22:10:03.209Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T22:20:04.035Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-31T22:05:41.765Z","text_content":"Gold and silver were the first to move, selling off aggressively, as if they were memecoins.

This level of forced selling typically occurs when markets shift abruptly, squeezing leveraged longs and shorts alike and amplifying volatility.  Liquidations of this size reflect a period of heightened risk aversion, where stop losses are triggered and positions are closed automatically, often driving price action further in the same direction before stabilizing. These events are most common when major support levels break or when unexpected macro or on-chain data accelerates a sell-off.  For traders, this underscores the importance of risk management, especially in highly leveraged products. Large liquidations don’t necessarily mark a trend reversal on their own, but they do highlight that many participants were overleveraged or poorly positioned relative to market structure.  In the context of broader market trends, such liquidation waves often coincide with pullbacks in major assets like $BTC  and $ETH , and can lead to short-term panic before buyers step back in. As volatility returns, key levels and volume confirmation will be critical in identifying whether this is a temporary shake-out or a deeper corrective phase. #Macro Insights#  #INX  #BTC  #ETH","gravity_id":"373396966","id":115309,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T23:30:02.352Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T00:00:04.945Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-31T23:24:39.970Z","text_content":"$ETH WHERE IS THOMAS LEE #AMBERALERT …","gravity_id":"373396936","id":115310,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T23:30:02.704Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T00:00:05.156Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-31T23:20:14.905Z","text_content":"$ETH once this stuff reaches a top SELL trust me , i remember seeing a guy in here ranting about everyone should sell their ETH bags when it hit its all time highs and i looked at him like a dummy !!! 😂😂😂 guess whos the dummy now , alexa play free falling by idk who just play it … 🥲🥲🥲","gravity_id":"373397580","id":115311,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T23:30:03.060Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T23:50:04.438Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-31T23:37:57.781Z","text_content":"🔴 The Ethereum position was liquidated.

This is another case of how even the largest positions with a good profit margin can be liquidated when the market regime changes.","gravity_id":"373400035","id":115318,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T23:40:02.633Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T00:30:05.729Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-31T23:34:45.112Z","text_content":"While we’re still waiting for @opensea to help us out with our reveal. \n\nThe floor price on some of the NFTs are about $3 in base eth. \n\nIf there’s ever an entry this is the one\n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/kingmidas\n\n#NFT #NFTCollections ","gravity_id":"373397696","id":115319,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T23:40:03.000Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T00:20:05.139Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-31T23:34:45.110Z","text_content":"Trust Model: Explicit Assumptions and Failure Modes\n\nSecurity systems fail at their trust boundaries. \n\nRAVID’s trust model makes these boundaries explicit, allowing operators and reviewers to understand exactly what assumptions are being made.\n\nRAVID defines trust per subsystem, anchoring each to specific primitives rather than implicit operator behavior.\n\nNetwork identity relies on X.509 certificates; compromise requires CA failure\n\nCompute consensus assumes fewer than 20% malicious nodes in BFT execution\n\nKey material uses 2-of-3 Shamir secret sharing; compromise requires multiple shares\n\nEconomic settlement depends on blockchain security assumptions (e.g., Ethereum 51% resistance)\n\nRandomness is derived from block hashes; manipulation requires miner collusion\n\nBy documenting these assumptions explicitly, RAVID avoids ambiguous guarantees and enables precise risk evaluation.\n\nRelevant documentation:\nhttps://t.co/ypaAik6Mw8\n\n$ENX","gravity_id":"373397695","id":115320,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T23:40:03.368Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T00:20:05.486Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-31T23:33:41.574Z","text_content":"Btc Bottom is in!\n\n\nBitcoin is in the same position as the 2020 COVID crash on the RSI ahead of the monthly close.\n\n\nBookmark it.\n\n\n#btc #bitcoin #altcoins $BTC $ETH","gravity_id":"373397689","id":115321,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T23:40:03.919Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T00:10:05.839Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-01-31T23:30:00.109Z","text_content":"🚨This launch marks a \"real-time\" inflection point for the #Ethereum  ecosystem.

Moves like this often unfold faster than traditional trading setups comfortably allow, which raises questions about how market participants observe and respond to volatility.  Derivative products that track U.S. equities without direct ownership have emerged as one way people study short-term price behavior. These instruments mirror the movements of well-known companies such as #Nvidia  and #Tesla  and operate on extended trading schedules, allowing closer observation of momentum as it develops. For some, this structure resembles the continuous nature of major crypto markets rather than the stop-start rhythm of standard equity trading.  Competitive trading events, such as Bitget’s Stock Futures Championship, add a gamified layer to this environment, combining simulated challenges, ranked participation, and pooled rewards. Beyond incentives, these formats are often positioned as ways to experiment with strategy, timing, and risk awareness in rapidly changing conditions.  Stepping back, episodes like this reinforce a broader lesson: market volatility is less about speed for its own sake and more about judgment. Careful observation, controlled experimentation, and reflection tend to matter far more than impulsive reactions when prices move quickly. ﻿$BTC   $ETH  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373403933","id":115654,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T05:20:03.289Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T05:50:04.523Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-01T05:10:25.155Z","text_content":"$ETH Long 10 ?\nSell 3400$?","gravity_id":"373403913","id":115655,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T05:20:03.908Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T05:50:04.879Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-01T05:36:04.569Z","text_content":"⚡ UPDATE: BitMine’s $ETH   treasury is $6B underwater as leverage snaps and liquidity vanishes. ﻿$BTC  #ETH","gravity_id":"373405041","id":115677,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T05:40:02.737Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T06:00:04.522Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-01T05:34:49.123Z","text_content":"⚡ UPDATE: BitMine’s ETH treasury is $6B underwater as leverage snaps and liquidity vanishes. #crypto  $ETH","gravity_id":"373404365","id":115678,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T05:40:03.103Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T06:00:04.719Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-01T05:48:01.901Z","text_content":"Sunday morning.\nThe market wakes up in red.\n\n\n$BTC down ~6% - dragging the whole market with it.\n$ETH hit harder, around -10%, pressure everywhere.\n\n\nNo panic.

The event, alongside broader market declines, also impacted other assets. Over 434,000 traders faced liquidations, with long positions bearing the brunt. Hyperliquid led with over $1  billion in liquidations, while Bybit and Binance also saw significant losses. Liquidations often reveal market sentiment and overcrowded trades, potentially signaling upcoming reversals. #CryptoCrash  #Ethereum  #Liquidations  #MarketVolatility","gravity_id":"373405569","id":115790,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T07:10:03.220Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T07:20:03.912Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-01T07:06:22.737Z","text_content":"$ETH  2400 can we see 2000?  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#  #BNBChain#  #Meme Alpha#","gravity_id":"373404882","id":115791,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T07:10:03.590Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T07:20:04.144Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-01T07:06:19.970Z","text_content":"$ETH I'm bullish on ETH, next BTC in the long run","gravity_id":"373405555","id":115792,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T07:10:03.947Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T07:20:04.504Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-01T07:18:33.897Z","text_content":"$ETH  is right at an important demand zone here.\r \r This is a level the Bulls really need to defend. \r If buyers show up and hold this area, we could get some relief, at least some sideways action.\r \r But if price can’t hold this zone, then it’s hard to ignore the downside risk.

As late January wraps up, Ethereum keeps trading under pressure - and with $BTC  setting an uncertain macro backdrop, risk is quietly concentrating where most people aren’t looking.  Here’s the key shift: leverage is rising even as exposure shrinks. Binance data shows Ethereum’s Estimated Leverage Ratio hitting a new all-time high near 0.675. Price has hovered around ~$2,700, meaning traders aren’t betting big on direction - they’re squeezing returns out of tight ranges with leverage.  Historically, leverage this high makes $ETH  extremely sensitive. When ratios push toward 0.70, even small price moves can trigger large liquidations. That’s when volatility feels “sudden,” even without big headlines.  At the same time, participation is thinning. Total open interest has dropped to ~$16.4B, the lowest since November. Fewer contracts, higher leverage - a mix that often leads to sharper moves than price alone suggests.  📌 The takeaway: Ethereum isn’t collapsing, but it’s becoming more fragile. With leverage concentrated and fewer players involved, the next volatility spike may come from positioning - not news.  #ETH  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373407965","id":116119,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T10:20:03.597Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T10:20:03.597Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-01T10:25:45.090Z","text_content":"Ready to warm up those #crypto brains? 🧠\n\nWhich token standard is commonly used for NFTs on Ethereum?\n\nA.

Some exchanges report to the IRS, others don’t. No tax form does not mean no taxes owed. Your obligation depends on your activity, not the platform.\n\nWhich crypto platforms don’t report to the IRS?\nSome platforms don’t send user data due to structure.\n• DEXs – No accounts, smart contracts\n• Foreign exchanges – Usually report locally\n• P2P platforms – Match users, not brokers\nReporting status affects paperwork, not tax liability.\n\nWhy don’t decentralized exchanges report?\nDEXs don’t run like traditional companies.\n• No central database\n• No identity verification system\n• No way to issue tax forms\nBut blockchain activity is public and traceable when funds move to regulated platforms.\n\nWhat must U.S. taxpayers report?\nThe IRS treats crypto as property.\nReport:\n• Gains from selling, swapping, spending\n• Income from mining, staking, airdrops, payments\nKeep dates, USD values, and transaction type. Wallet transfers aren’t taxable but should be tracked.\n\nConclusion\nNon-reporting exchanges may mean fewer forms, not fewer taxes. U.S. taxpayers must report all crypto income and gains regardless of where trading happens.\n\nFAQs\nAre U.S. users at risk using non-reporting exchanges?\nYes. Crypto income and gains must still be reported.\n\nCan the IRS track DEX activity?\nYes. Blockchain data is public and analyzable.\nDo DEXs or Bitget issue IRS forms?\nNo. Users must keep their own records.\nDoes using foreign exchanges reduce taxes?\nNo. Taxes depend on residency and taxable events.\n\nSource: https://www.bitget.com/academy/which-crypto-exchanges-do-not-report-to-irs  $BTC  $ETH   #Meme Alpha#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373411170","id":116180,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T10:50:03.595Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T11:20:05.853Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-01T11:00:00.151Z","text_content":"$ETH I've been telling you since this morning: SELL.

ETH was strongly rejected from the major resistance zone near ATH, confirming market weakness.  Price is now trading below key levels and moving toward a Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) backed by long-term support lines.  Also Still ETH doesn't fill the CME Gap($2,344-$2,186).  In the short term, a further ~20% downside is still possible.  If this support zone holds, ETH could stage a +40% recovery toward higher resistance.
