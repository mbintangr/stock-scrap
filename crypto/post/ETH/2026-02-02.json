It’s a “confirm the flush + watch flows” phase.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOn-Chain & Technical Trend\n• Large liquidation days often cleanse excess leverage, but if open interest rebuilds too quickly, the next squeeze/liquidation risk rises again.\n• For BTC, the first technical hurdle is reclaiming and holding $80k. Failure tends to invite another liquidity sweep.\n• ETH saw heavy long liquidations; a short-term rebound is possible if funding/OI stabilize, but the quality of the rebound matters (spot support vs. pure derivatives).\n• “It fell a lot” is not a signal by itself. Confirmation should come from volume and flows (ETF / stablecoin / spot).\n• Conclusion: Leverage alone cannot create a sustainable uptrend. The recovery condition is “flow reversal + healthier OI structure.”\n―――――――――――――――――――\nSentiment\n• Fear & Greed fell to 14 (Extreme Fear). Sentiment is near capitulation, but turning points are decided by flows, not emotions.\n• As long liquidations stay dominant, participants remain defensive and rallies tend to fade quickly.\n• In thin liquidity, even rebounds can be violent and unstable, making trend confirmation difficult.\n• Conclusion: Sentiment is depressed, but “low sentiment” is not the same as “trend reversal.” Flow confirmation comes first.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nU.S. Traditional Markets\n• Fed-chair headlines and policy interpretation gaps can raise volatility and spill into crypto via macro risk-on/off swings.\n• Shutdown risk tends to increase hedging demand and can cap upside in risk assets if uncertainty persists.\n• The metals selloff highlights how leverage and margin dynamics can overwhelm “safe-haven narratives,” reinforcing broader de-risking behavior.\n• Conclusion: BTC is not trading as a standalone crypto story; it’s being amplified by macro unwind dynamics and thin liquidity.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOverall Assessment\nA liquidation-driven full reset is underway and sentiment has sunk into Extreme Fear, but the key reversal condition—spot flow recovery—still looks unconfirmed. With shutdown risk and Fed-chair uncertainty still in the background, rebounds are likely to be short-covering led and therefore heavy on the upside.\nToday’s key watch points:\n• Can BTC reclaim and hold $80k (quality of the rebound)?\n• Do liquidation pressures visibly cool down, and does the long-heavy imbalance normalize?\n• Does Fear & Greed start recovering from extreme levels?\n• Do shutdown-related headlines reignite risk-off, or calm markets enough for flows to stabilize?","gravity_id":"373423317","id":117447,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T22:40:02.646Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T23:20:05.384Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-01T22:37:31.033Z","text_content":"Ethereum L2s are outperforming $ETH  by 900% capital is clearly rotating into the scaling layer   #ETH","gravity_id":"373423313","id":117448,"createdAt":"2026-02-01T22:40:03.016Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-01T23:10:04.574Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-01T22:34:49.619Z","text_content":"$ETH   Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech.

The most effective bear-market strategy isn’t trying to catch the exact bottom it’s risk control and patience. Dollar-cost averaging into high-conviction assets, keeping cash reserves, and avoiding excessive leverage help traders survive volatility. This is also the period to rotate from speculation into quality: strong networks, healthy balance sheets, and real adoption tend to outperform once conditions stabilize.

By Saturday, the index rebounded slightly to 20, still firmly in Extreme Fear territory. The index had been in Fear since Jan. 20 before sliding into Extreme Fear on Thursday.   Analytics platform Santiment flagged the current wave of negativity as one of the few #bullish  signals available right now. The firm noted that the ratio of bearish to bullish comments on social media is heavily skewed toward fear, which historically precedes a price reversal.   $BTC  is trading at $76,250 after falling nearly 10% over the past seven days. $ETH  has declined more than 17% during the same period, now sitting at $2,290. Both assets have been under sustained selling pressure since mid-January.   $BTC  has not closed above the $100,000 mark since Nov. 13. The prolonged consolidation below that level has prompted some analysts to question whether the broader #crypto  market has entered a bear phase, though Santiment's data suggests otherwise.   Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen addressed expectations of a large rotation from gold and silver into #cryptocurrency  during a video on Thursday. He stated that such a rotation into $BTC  is \"probably not going to happen\" in the short term, pushing back against a widely held assumption in the market.   Coinbase chief business officer Shan Aggarwal took a different view, posting on X that the current downturn is \"just a blip.\" Aggarwal pointed to traditional financial institutions like MasterCard, PayPal, American Express, and JPMorgan actively posting #crypto-related  job listings as a sign that institutional interest remains intact.   Bitwise CEO Huntley Horsley echoed a similar stance on the same day, stating the space is moving toward the #mainstream.","gravity_id":"373424584","id":117685,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T01:30:03.063Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T02:00:05.624Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-02T01:36:31.433Z","text_content":"$BTC  Drops Out of Global Top 10 Assets by Market Cap    $BTC 's market #capitalization  has fallen to approximately $1.57 trillion, placing it 13th among global assets. The drop came after its price declined sharply from around $90,000 to $78,500 over the past seven days, a loss of more than 11%. Saudi Aramco and Tesla now rank above $BTC  by this metric.   During October's all-time high, $BTC  briefly traded above $126,000 and approached a $2.5 trillion valuation. At that point, it held the seventh position among global assets and had previously entered the top five, surpassing companies like Google and Amazon.   The sell-off was partly driven by a surge in U.S. dollar strength following President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next #FederalReserve  chair. Warsh is known for favoring higher real interest rates and a smaller Fed balance sheet, and his appointment triggered the dollar's biggest rally since May.   The dollar rally pulled #down  not only $BTC  but also precious metals. Gold plunged 9% in a single trading session to just under $4,900, while silver dropped 26.3% to $85.3. Despite the drawdown, gold remains the largest asset globally by market cap at $34.1 trillion, followed by silver at $4.8 trillion.   $ETH  also took a significant hit during this period, falling to 56th place among global assets with a market cap just above $300 billion. Ethereum lost 14.5% of its value in a single week, pushing it below companies like Caterpillar, Coca-Cola, and Cisco by #marketcap .   The broader #crypto  market lost roughly 6% in 24 hours, with total market capitalization dropping from about $3.1 trillion to around $2.6 trillion. The decline triggered $1.8 billion in liquidations across crypto markets, the largest single-day event since October.","gravity_id":"373427288","id":117691,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T01:40:02.056Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T02:10:04.552Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-02T01:33:45.557Z","text_content":"$ETH cant hold 2300$, tomorrow the market is going to be DOWN.

As $BTC  slid and liquidations accelerated, Ethereum dropped below $2,500 and is now trading near ~$2,370 - down over 12% in a day, with losses piling up across the week and month.  Here’s why downside calls are growing louder. Analysts like Jake Wujastyk say if pressure continues, ETH could trade in the $1,800–$1,850 range. Another analyst, G. Martin, notes that as long as Bitcoin stays structurally weak, ETH likely remains under stress - with $2,000–$2,200 as the next zone to watch, and deeper risk toward $1,600–$1,800 if selling persists.  Flows aren’t helping. Over 60,000 $ETH  moved to exchanges in 72 hours, Vitalik transferred ~$44M in ETH, and large positions were forced out. One long alone reportedly lost ~$250M after liquidation. Add ETF outflows (~$327M this week) and the pressure looks structural, not random.  The wild card is BitMine. Tom Lee’s firm is now sitting on an unrealized ~$6B ETH loss, yet continues accumulating. That tells me this isn’t about short-term pain - it’s conviction versus timing.

In 2026, exchange support plays a major role in how efficiently investors can trade, hold, and manage Libera Financial within regulated environments rather than relying solely on DeFi tools.  \r \r \r How Is Libera Financial Accessed on Centralized Exchanges?\r \r In 2026, Libera Financial is accessed through a mix of spot markets, Web3 routing, and institutional services on major exchanges such as Bitget, Kraken, Coinbase, and   OSL. This mirrors how yield-linked assets increasingly move alongside core market liquidity like $ETH , blending DeFi-native mechanics with centralized execution and custody.  \r \r \r Do Exchanges Support Libera Financial’s Yield Features?\r \r Some exchanges extend Libera Financial’s yield mechanics through integrated earn products or balance-based reward systems. Others focus strictly on spot trading, requiring users to manage yield externally through self-custody wallets or decentralized protocols.  \r \r \r Which Type of Exchange Is Best for Libera Financial?\r \r The best exchange depends on investor priorities. Retail traders often prefer platforms with integrated earn features and flexible liquidity, while institutional users may favor exchanges offering regulated custody, OTC execution, and compliance-focused infrastructure.  \r \r \r Conclusion\r \r Libera Financial has become broadly accessible across centralized exchanges in 2026, but the quality of access varies by platform. Choosing an exchange that balances liquidity, compliance, and yield integration is essential for efficient and secure exposure to the asset.  \r \r \r FAQ \r \r Is Libera Financial listed on major exchanges?

Yes, on select platforms that integrate earn or balance-based reward systems.","gravity_id":"373434320","id":118214,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T10:00:04.589Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T11:10:04.838Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-02T09:47:24.532Z","text_content":"JUST IN:🚨 Over $4.02 trillion wiped out from gold and silver's market cap today. \n \nWhile Bitcoin dropped below  $78,000 $BTC and Ethereum below $2,300  $ETH","gravity_id":"373433948","id":118215,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T10:00:04.809Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T11:10:05.228Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-02T09:46:45.291Z","text_content":"Crypto: $ETH staking reaches unprecedented levels\n\nA silent revolution is underway on Ethereum.

Cash withdrawals, card payments, online transfers, and digital platforms all have different pricing, which can lead to differences in the final amount received. Even small gaps can result in significant losses for larger conversions.  How much does the rate vary?  The Sol to USD rate typically varies between one and eight percent. The mid market rate reflects the true rate without markups and serves as a reference.  Why are cash withdrawals expensive?  Cash withdrawals include multiple fees from banks, ATMs, and card networks, such as foreign transaction, ATM, and network fees, plus exchange rate markups. Withdrawing larger amounts less often and declining optional conversions can reduce costs.  Why are online transfers and cards cheaper?  Online transfers offer better rates due to lower overhead and high transaction volumes. Card payments sit between cash and online rates, depending on fees and conversion handling. Paying in local currency is usually cheaper.  Where can rates be compared?  Rates can be compared on platforms like Bitget, Wise, Xe, Google Finance, Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, which offer real-time pricing, charts, and conversion tools for digital or fiat transactions.  Conclusion  Sol to USD rates vary by method. Cash withdrawals are most expensive, while online transfers and stablecoins are closest to the mid market. Comparing providers and fees helps avoid losses.  FAQ  What is the rate based on? Supply and demand and economic conditions. Should I exchange money before traveling? Exchange small amounts and use cards or digital methods. Is it better to pay in Sol or USD? Paying in Sol usually gives better rates. Are digital conversions legal? Yes, follow local regulations. ﻿Source : https://www.bitget.com/academy/peruvian-sol-to-usd-exchange-guide   ﻿$BTC  $ETH","gravity_id":"373434430","id":118253,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T10:10:07.317Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T11:20:06.078Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-02T09:58:45.055Z","text_content":"Security Update on the $EYWA token\n\nWe have contained the exploit\n\nThe hacker extracted $EYWA from our bridge on the Ethereum network but is unable to spend them since only the @XTexchange had the Ethereum deposit for our token and it has been frozen. \n\nYour $EYWA is SAFU, as are all of them on the Arbitrum network.\n\n➕ To be extra safe, we are in contact with all the centralized exchanges where $EYWA is traded (@kucoincom, @Gate, @MEXC_Official, @BingXOfficial, and @BitMartExchange) to make sure that the hacker has zero options to sell or otherwise use the stolen tokens.\n\nAs such, the stolen $EYWA tokens have no way to enter circulation and affect the token supply.

More than $700 million in leveraged positions were wiped out in 24 hours, with Ethereum accounting for nearly $300 million. Additional pressure came from whale selling and around $200 million in ETF outflows.  Analysts warn that the $2,000 to $2,200 zone is a key support. A break below this range could open the door to $1,800 or even $1,400 in the coming weeks.

I don't usually post on ETH since its just a boring broad market asset that sits beneath BTC. \n\nThey're all both just bets on world economic growth now like the S&P500. ETH has moved in a range because it doesn't have fair world currency hype like BTC but BTC has even lost that race now governments, institutions, and Elite Stakeholders have taken control of the supply. The majority of the supply held by .01% of users. with ETH being almost 80% owned and BTC closer to 70% using $10M+ as a metric for Elite. This makes ETH almost pointless to track in my opinion.\n\nThe banking industry being replaced by ETH or BTC isnt happening anymore. It's just a tool they use to save money on fees and make transfers easier. Like the hype around SWIFT taking over through faster, cheaper transactions in the 70s, the hype around ETH and BTC doing the same will fade as well. \n\nThe big plays now lie outside of the infrastructure that blockchain has provided. Blockchains that create new products or services like BTC did are those that will see major gains in the future. \n\nFor example, in game purchasing reaching almost $200B in 2025 roughly $50B of this was lost to companies like google and apple in fees and revenue on transactions to companies like visa. If they had their own blockchain, the $50B would have been mostly proffit for the game developers.\n\nIf a AAA game company does a fair launch with their own blockchain and coin for a new MMO, Sandbox or FPS with a marketplace that takes off and has 10 million weekly players like other AAA games do. It would contend with ETHs market cap, if it was all 3 in one it would have tens of millions of users, and likely be more valuable than BTC. That's one product. I'm sure there are many others that will be like Amazon, Google, Netflix, all products and services built on the internet which is tech infrastructure similar to blockchain.","gravity_id":"373435366","id":118361,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T11:00:03.444Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T11:00:03.444Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-02T10:50:58.631Z","text_content":"$ETH   DAO funds were routed through Tornado Cash sparking debate on privacy vs compliance in Web3.

It’s Not Just Price. It’s Policy Risk Being Repriced  Today’s sell-off isn’t random volatility. It’s macro repricing happening in real time.  Markets reacted swiftly to two signals. The nomination of Kevin Warsh as a potential Fed Chair, a figure widely viewed as more hawkish, and hotter-than-expected PPI data that reinforced the idea that inflation pressures aren’t fully under control.  Together, these developments triggered a clear risk-off rotation.  $BTC  slid toward $76,472, while $ETH  dropped sharply to around $2,225. This move wasn’t driven by crypto-specific weakness, but by a shift in liquidity expectations across global markets.  Here’s the part many miss. Crypto doesn’t trade inflation directly. It trades rate expectations.  A more hawkish Fed outlook strengthens the dollar, pushes yields higher, and compresses liquidity across risk assets, including crypto.  Glassnode data suggests this move aligns more with derisking than panic. Leverage is being unwound, not a full capitulation.  Key insight: This isn’t a “crypto is broken” moment. It’s a macro stress test.  If inflation cools and policy expectations soften, crypto can regain footing quickly. If not, volatility is likely to remain elevated, especially for overleveraged positions.  Markets aren’t reacting to fear alone. They’re adjusting to the possibility of tighter money lasting longer.

Price will follow. #BTC Price Analysis#   #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373435402","id":118381,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T11:10:02.781Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T11:20:04.867Z"},{"crypto_id":"1027","crypto_name":"ETH","post_time":"2026-02-02T11:16:22.208Z","text_content":"$ETH   /USDT Technical Analysis Executive Summary Ethereum is exhibiting bearish short-term and mid-term trends, with price action consistently below key exponential moving averages (EMAs).

When big players unload coins quickly, especially during low-liquidity periods, prices tend to slide faster than usual.\r \r Second, the broader financial environment isn’t helping. Money is being pulled out of risk assets as U.S. liquidity tightens. Investors are shifting toward safer places like cash or #gold , and #crypto  funds have seen notable outflows. Even Ethereum ETFs have lost assets recently, showing that demand from traditional investors has cooled.\r \r Finally, the charts turned against ETH.

While this move pushed ETH into oversold territory, a sign that selling may slow down, confidence won’t return unless that level is reclaimed.\r \r The bigger picture?

From the current structure, ETH is showing deeper corrective behavior — the weekly candle has pushed firmly into support, and buyers haven’t shown a strong reaction yet.

The chart projects a possible continuation toward the $4,900–$5,400 region if the right‑shoulder support remains intact.

Introduction Crypto savings accounts in 2026 offer interest on holdings through flexible or locked products, staking pools, and yield-bearing stablecoins. Leading platforms for earning passive yields include Bitget, Binance, OKX, Bybit, Kraken, Coinbase,  Nexo, KuCoin, and Gate. APYs vary by asset, lock-up period, and market conditions, with stablecoins typically ranging 4–12% and volatile coins higher but riskier.  Which Platforms Offer the Highest Savings Yields? Yields are influenced by supply/demand, staking rewards, and promotional rates. Early 2026 data from DeFiLlama show current benchmarks for major assets like USDT, USDC, $BTC , and $ETH  .  How Do Top Platforms Compare on Savings Interest Rates? - Bitget    • Stablecoin savings: 5–12% (flexible & locked)     • Staking & Launchpool yields up to 15–30% on select altcoins     • Mix of on-chain and platform-managed products  - Binance    • Stablecoin Earn: 4–10% flexible, up to 12–15% locked     • Wide staking pool options (ETH, SOL etc.) 5–20%+     • Largest variety of assets and terms  - OKK   • Savings rates 4–12% on USDT/USDC     • On-chain staking yields up to 18–25%     • Good flexible and fixed-term balance  - Bybit   • Stablecoin savings 5–11%     • Launchpool short-term boosts 10–30%+      Conclusion  Bitget provides strong short-term yields through flexible products and Launchpool.

Regulated platforms like Kraken or Coinbase generally offer lower but more stable rates.  Do flexible accounts have lower APYs? Usually yes—locked terms often pay 1–5% higher to encourage longer commitments.

The recent sell-off looks exhaustive, with price showing slowing momentum after a clear liquidity sweep. As long as this weekly demand holds, Ethereum can attempt a recovery toward the 2,800–3,200 resistance zone, where previous structure failed.    A decisive reclaim of that range would shift market bias bullish. Failure to defend current support opens risk toward 1,700–1,800.

The infamous “Hyperunit whale,” once praised for perfectly timing shorts before a major crash, has now exited an ETH long with a ~$250M loss - leaving just $53 in the account. And yes, this all unfolded while $BTC  and the broader market were sliding hard.  Arkham data shows the trader had built a massive $ETH   long worth over $700M after the October win, when they reportedly made ~$200M shorting BTC and ETH just minutes before Trump’s tariff announcement. That crash triggered ~$18B in liquidations. This time, the bet went the other way - and ETH’s drop to ~$2,400 turned the position toxic fast.  Here’s the takeaway:  • A $900M+ leveraged book doesn’t protect you from drawdowns  • Timing one macro event doesn’t guarantee survival in the next  • Leverage cuts both ways - brutally  The lesson isn’t about whales or drama. It’s about risk. Even the most aggressive, well-timed traders can give it all back when leverage meets volatility.

If it breaks below 2250, it will retest 2157, and significant declines should be wary of false breakouts and subsequent rebounds.\r - If it drops near 2157 and quickly recovers, showing clear rebound signals, consider gradually buying long positions, with the first target at 2475 and the second target at 2787, with strict stop-loss below 2157.\r - If it rebounds above 2475 and meets resistance, or if the high points on smaller timeframes continue to decline, wait for short signals to appear before following up with short positions, targeting 2250 and then 2157 in sequence.\r - Key confirmation signals include: a reversal with a pin bar on smaller timeframes, confirmation of a breakout closing above key levels, or a trendline breakout that retests without breaking, before re-entering. \r \r 📝 The above analysis is for learning and communication purposes only and is no...\r \r 📊 Get detailed free analysis of any coin on any timeframe you want.
