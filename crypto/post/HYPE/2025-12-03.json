Rayls isn’t just another token: it’s built as a finance-grade blockchain bridging real banks, regulated institutions and DeFi, designed for compliance, privacy and scalable institutional liquidity. RLS comes with a fixed 10 billion total supply and only a fraction circulating initially, which, combined with Rayls’ core functions (gas, staking, validator fees, governance), sets up an interesting structural scarcity + utility dynamic as usage grows. If you’re eyeing fresh infrastructure-play altcoins beyond the usual suspects, RLS could be worth a closer look, especially with it now live on BingX and ready for trading.

Refer to the link below.\n\nLet's dive into it 🧵 ⬇️ \n\"𝗕𝗔𝗠 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗮 𝗯𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸-𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗽𝗼𝗹𝘆.\"\n\n𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘮𝘢𝘯: This critique argues that BAM introduces a single sequencer that will do all transaction scheduling for Solana. Even if the infrastructure is distributed, the scheduling rules originate from one system, which is controlled by Jito. Stakeholders worry this undermines Solana’s natural diversity of schedulers into one that could behave like a centralized sequencer, becoming a single point of failure and concentrating too much influence in one scheduler and one party.\n\nBAM is designed so no single entity can control transaction ordering.\n\nThe system will decentralize its operation and governance of scheduling logic through:\n• 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: any eligible operator can participate and run their own BAM Node.\n• 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲: BAM Nodes will be deployed across a geographically diverse network of operators.\n• 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻-𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲, 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴: all BAM code will be open source and auditable via cryptographic attestations.\n\nWhile it is true that BAM Nodes are currently solely run by Jito, starting in Q1 '26 the codebase will be open-sourced and independent operators will be onboarded.\n“𝗔𝘀 𝗮 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿, 𝗕𝗔𝗠 𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗺𝗲 𝘂𝗽 𝘁𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲𝗿”\n\n𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘮𝘢𝘯: This critique says that by opting into BAM, a validator effectively surrenders control over transaction ordering to a single scheduler. Instead of being able to run or adopt different schedulers, experiment with their own strategies, or switch between competing designs, they are bound to one system.\n\nTo enable Internet Capital Markets, Solana needs deterministic and transparent ordering rules. Fragmentation hurts users. BAM makes this possible with standardized, verifiable block building required by high-performance apps.\n\nThe facts are:\n• BAM is strictly opt-in. \n• Validators can fall back to Agave, Jito-Solana, or Firedancer clients\n• They can disconnect from BAM at any time\n\nBAM Plugins offer a platform for optimization and developer innovation that benefits all of Solana.\n\"𝗕𝗔𝗠 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗽𝗼𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲𝘀 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗮 𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄.\"\n\n𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘮𝘢𝘯: Stakeholders argue that aggregating public transactions into a single pipeline creates a central chokepoint through which all orderflow passes and gives advantages to whoever controls it. Even if neutral initially, BAM controls order flow, which can reinforce its competitive position and prevent other solutions from gaining traction.\n\nBAM collects transactions using the standard Solana TPU mechanism.\n\nThere is no distinction between \"BAM transactions\" and public ones. Validators receive the same public flow, just scheduled through a verifiable layer.\n\nValidators can revert to their native TPU instantly with zero switching costs, keeping orderflow public rather than fragmented into private channels.\n“𝗕𝗔𝗠 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗿𝗮 𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝘃𝘀. 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿’𝘀 𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗧𝗣𝗨.”\n\n𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘮𝘢𝘯: Stakeholders argue that one of Solana’s performance edge comes from transactions flowing directly to the leader’s TPU with minimal hops. Any intermediary routing layer, even a fast one, risks adding latency, jitter, and new points of failure under load, and could weaken IBRL mission compared to native TPU scheduling.\n\nBAM ensures minimal latency via a global footprint of 100+ nodes and strategic co-location, keeping round-trip times under 5ms.\n\nOur TEE stack is highly tuned using thread pinning and CPU isolation, achieving performance parity with Agave. With the upcoming migration to DoubleZero, we expect to surpass bare metal performance benchmarks.\n“𝗕𝗔𝗠 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀 𝘃𝘀. 𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀”\n\n𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘮𝘢𝘯: Validators have expressed concerns that BAM’s scheduling logic might reduce tips and overall rewards vs other blockbuilder or scheduling opportunities. Additionally, Plugin fee markets are not yet live, making upside theoretical while downside appears immediate.\n\nWe prioritize long-term profit maximization. BAM’s rewards are already comparable to Jito-Agave.\n\nPast disparities were driven by temporary, extractive schedulers elsewhere that are being deprecated. Future yield will be driven by Plugins and ACE, unlocking sustainable fee streams from net-new economic activity rather than short-term games.\n“𝗔𝘀 𝗮 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿, 𝗜 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗺𝘆 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗶𝗲𝗹𝗱.”\n\n𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘮𝘢𝘯: Stakers often choose validators based strictly on rewards. Even a small decrease in tips or variance in earnings across one epoch can cause delegated stake to flow elsewhere. Validators fear that adopting BAM early could put them at a competitive disadvantage if peers delay adoption.\n\nWe understand that validators must maximize yield for themselves and their stakers, but must also consider second order effects of their actions. Short-term yield hacking (sandwiching, slot-lagging) degrades overall execution quality and drives liquidity away.\n\nThe only sustainable path to higher yield is deeper onchain activity, which can only be enabled by better applications, deeper liquidity and tighter spreads.\n\"𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻-𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗱 𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗔𝗖𝗘) 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁.\"\n\n𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘮𝘢𝘯: Stakeholders argue that Solana applications already run well under Priority Fee and Tips inclusion mechanisms. Introducing ACE may increase complexity and create uneven execution guarantees between sophisticated apps and smaller developers. They worry that allowing applications to define ordering logic could lead to BAM privileging certain actors.\n\nSophisticated apps need guarantees like cancel-priority or liquidation-priority to function safely.\n\nHyperliquid does 10-15x the volume of Solana perps specifically because of its permissioned validator set that enforces strict ordering. Without ACE, these apps will migrate to custom L1s or L2s to get those guarantees.\n“𝗙𝗜𝗙𝗢 𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗮𝗶𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰”\n\n𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘮𝘢𝘯: Stakeholders argue that simple FIFO (first-in, first-out) ordering is the fairest and most neutral way to schedule transactions on Solana. It mirrors time-priority from traditional markets, is easy for users to understand (“if my tx arrives first, it executes first”), and avoids the “pay-to-win” dynamics of most blockchains.\n\nWhile FIFO appears fairest by processing transactions in the order they are received, it encourages users to spam the network to secure a favorable position, leading to congestion and money-burning latency races. \n\nThis breaks down when network demand is high, causing unpredictable delays for all users as queues lengthen. FIFO's one-size-fits-all approach fails to meet the needs of apps that require specific transaction ordering to function optimally.\n\"𝗔𝗿𝗲𝗻'𝘁 𝗕𝗔𝗠'𝘀 𝗧𝗿𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗘𝗻𝘃𝗶𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 (𝗧𝗘𝗘𝘀) 𝘃𝘂𝗹𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸𝘀?\"\n\n𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘮𝘢𝘯: TEEs have a history of side-channel vulnerabilities, firmware bugs, and supply-chain risks. Stakeholders argue that relying on TEEs for block scheduling could introduce correlated failure modes: if a hardware exploit affects SEV-SNP, BAM as a network could be compromised. They also argue that TEEs shift trust onto hardware vendors and data center providers.\n\nBAM runs on AMD SEV-SNP with cryptographic attestations in secure, compliant data centers (ISO 27001/SOC 2).\n\nEven in a worst-case hardware compromise, validator keys remain secure and the chain’s history cannot be rewritten, only the ordering privacy on that specific node is affected. Validators verify the \"measured TCB\" and can reject bad firmware via attestation.\n@0xmert The future of block-building is moving from fragmented scheduling to a transparent, verifiable marketplace. BAM is the solution.\n\nBillions must BAM! 💥\nhttps://bit.ly/48MmIVY","gravity_id":"371590538","id":2352,"createdAt":"2025-12-03T16:20:09.079Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-03T18:00:09.873Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2025-12-03T16:14:08.417Z","text_content":"Information asymmetry is why retail loses.
