We’re focused on one of the largest untapped markets in the world: Intellectual Property, a multi-trillion-dollar global economy that touches music, film, art, gaming, and culture.  Camp helps creators protect their work from AI exploitation, secure attribution automatically onchain, monetize their IP through programmable rights, and brings global catalogues & cultural assets onchain.  From major music artists to entertainment brands, IP builders are integrating with Camp today.  Crypto doesn’t evolve through hype cycles. It will evolve when real industries plug into it.
