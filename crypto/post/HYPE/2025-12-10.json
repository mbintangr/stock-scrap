This is best displayed with Tanssi.  The entire ecosystem and functionality are built around having a token with multiple utilities, all built into the protocol.  Here’s how it works: More validators and sequencers staking for security. More sequencer slots require bonding/rotation. More blocks are produced across sovereign L1s, each secured and paid for with TANSSI. More interchain messages and transactions require TANSSI as the fee asset.  With such robust and consistent, sustainable usecase, it’s clear to see how Tanssi is among the top ranks of having a real economic engine which helps them drive revenue.  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371812612","id":17360,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T14:40:13.110Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T16:30:14.797Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2025-12-10T15:05:29.679Z","text_content":"Copium is expensive.
