You can now long or short the unlaunched Fogo token with up to 3x leverage. \nAs a reminder, hyperps do not rely on any external data for the oracle price. Hyperps trade like perpetual contracts that users are familiar with, but do not require an external spot or index oracle price. Instead, the funding rate is determined relative to a moving average of the hyperp mark price. This makes the hyperp price more stable and less susceptible to manipulation, unlike usual pre-launch futures.     \n\nWhen trading hyperps, funding rates are important to consider. If there is heavy price momentum in one direction, funding will heavily incentivize positions in the opposite direction for the next eight hours. As always, be sure to understand the contract before trading.     \n\nTrading is on low leverage and isolated margin only. Beware of low liquidity, high volatility, potentially extreme funding, and increased liquidation risk. Note: FOGO-USD will convert to a vanilla perp upon CEX spot listing. See Docs for more.     \n\nFOGO-USD is a hyperp contract that poses higher than normal risk. Do not trade contracts you are unfamiliar with and do not understand the risks for.

It was able to move quickly because it stands somewhat unimpeded by corporate guardrails, but a significant element was being emphatically \"in the know,\" spotting opportunities due to its team being tightly interwoven with the goings-on onchain.\n\nFebruary brought the HyperEVM launch, the general-purpose smart contract layer built on top of HyperCore. While it took time to find its footing, it did so without any top-down incentive programs, building a core user base who believed in the chain's vision rather than just extracting incentives.\n\nQ2 2025: Breaking Out\n\nTraction came faster than most expected. Beyond HYPE climbing nearly 4x off its April lows, by May Hyperliquid commanded 70% of all onchain perps volume, a staggering figure for a platform with zero VC backing and no token incentives.\n\nAs the market roared back, Hyperliquid's smooth UX and deep liquidity captured the order flow, with total volume climbing to $1.5T. The HyperEVM hit its stride alongside, growing TVL from $350M in April to $1.8B by mid-June as projects launched through @kinetiq_xyz, @felixprotocol, and @liminalmoney, all while burning HYPE in the background.\n\nAmid this growth, Hyperliquid seemed to be everywhere. Publicized on national TV. Profiled by Bloomberg. At the center of policy conversations with the CFTC.\n\nQ3 2025: Peak Momentum & Splintering Begins\n\nQ3 opened with a signal that Hyperliquid's infra was becoming essential outside its own ecosystem.\n\n@phantom Wallet integrated Hyperliquid via builder codes, Hyperliquid's mechanism for letting external platforms earn fees on trades they route to HyperCore. @Rabby_io followed. Then @MetaMask. A myriad of mobile trading apps went live on builder codes. \"Partners\" have earned nearly $50M in fees through these integrations, routing $158B in volume.\n\nThen, in September, came the USDH bidding war, revealing just how valuable Hyperliquid had become.\n\nThe problem was simple: Hyperliquid held ~8% of Circle's USDC supply in its bridge, leaking roughly $100M annually to Coinbase while seeing none of that yield recycled into its own ecosystem. A native stablecoin would fix that, potentially redirecting $200M in annual revenue back to Hyperliquid.\n\nHeavyweights threw their names in. Ethena offered $75M in growth commitments. Paxos dangled PayPal and Venmo integrations. But @nativemarkets won, a team led by HYPE contributor @fiege_max, former Uniswap Labs COO @Mclader, and Paradigm researcher @_anishagnihotri. Why? They fit the ethos: bootstrapped, aligned, and ready to build something organic.\n\nThe ripple effects extended beyond Hyperliquid. MegaETH announced its own native stablecoin initiative shortly after. Sui followed suit in November.\n\nYet USDH also marked HYPE's peak in mid-September, and the moment competition began to bite. Aster and Lighter both launched with aggressive airdrop campaigns. Hyperliquid's market share splintered, sitting at 17.1% at time of writing.\n\nQ4: Maturation & Growing Pains\n\nIn October, HIP-3 went live, opening permissionless listings on HyperCore and advancing both the exchange's expansion and its decentralization.\n\nAnyone who stakes 500K HYPE could now deploy custom markets such as equity perpetuals, markets using yield-bearing collateral from Ethena, or markets for synthetic exposure to private companies from @ventuals.\n\nYet, despite HIP-3's launch, HYPE price has dropped nearly 50% from its September peak. Besides market conditions and competition, two developments stand out.\n\nFirst, the quarter brought Hyperliquid's first ADL (Automatic De-Leveraging) event in over two years. During October 10's market breakdown, over-leveraged positions ran out of margin faster than the liquidation system could absorb. The protocol triggered auto-deleveraging over 40 times in a 12-minute span. While the system stayed solvent, Hyperliquid will likely need time to recover from the event.\n\nThen, in November, team token unlocks began. Despite lower-than-expected totals, this vesting is likely contributing to HYPE's underperformance. Selling was minimal, only 23% went to OTC desks while 40% was re-staked, but the pace of future unlocks remains unclear. From a protocol that's stood out by being transparent, this lack of clarity is likely causing market unease.\n\nThe Perps Proving Ground\n\nWhile the market and trading activity are down, it's important not to discount how much the perps landscape has evolved alongside Hyperliquid itself.\n\n@Lighter_xyz and @Aster_DEX offer real alternatives. Offchain, Coinbase's perps offerings will soon be joined by Robinhood. More competitors will emerge as perpetuals continue going mainstream.\n\nHyperliquid is in the midst of its proving ground and will continue to be in 2026. The question isn't whether it had a remarkable 2025, it certainly did. The question is whether the exchange can demonstrate that its model remains superior as the field gets crowded.\n\nWhat got them here was building a better product and ecosystem without shortcuts. What keeps them there will be doing it again.","gravity_id":"371848652","id":19852,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T15:00:16.371Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T17:50:18.673Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2025-12-11T15:17:22.155Z","text_content":"$HYPE Bullish","gravity_id":"371846956","id":19900,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T15:20:15.187Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T17:50:18.544Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2025-12-11T16:29:37.764Z","text_content":"Did You Know? 👀 $BTC  $HYPE  \r \r Finora AI can detect RSI divergences for you — automatically.\r \r With /divergence command, the bot scans the entire market and shows you coins with potential bullish or bearish divergence forming on the 15-minute chart.\r \r No manual chart checking.
