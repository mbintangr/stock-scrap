First, supply reduction creates scarcity, a classic mechanism to support valuation if demand holds or grows. That’s why HYPE ticked up on announcement and why open interest and funding rates in derivatives have responded positively.  ￼  Second, this is governance in action. It’s not just burning tokens; it’s a signal about how seriously the community views structural tokenomics over short-term unlock pressure.

But before you market buy, you need to understand the nuance here. This isn't a typical \"send to dead wallet\" event—it's something smarter.  The \"Ghost Burn\" Detail: 👻 These tokens officially reside in the \"Assistance Fund\" and were technically already inaccessible (no private keys). However, they were still counted in the Total Supply/FDV metrics, making $HYPE  look more expensive than it actually was.  The Vote: If this passes (highly likely), these tokens are officially removed from the supply math.  The Impact: Your slice of the pie doesn't change, but the \"Fully Diluted Valuation\" (FDV) drops instantly.  Why this matters for your Price Target: 🎯 Institutions hate high FDV. By officially burning this stack, Hyperliquid is artificially lowering its valuation metric without changing the price, making it mathematically more attractive to big capital.  Support Level: We are testing $26.50 - $27.00. This burn news should act as a fundamental floor.

Long setups remain valid only on a confirmed breakout and sustained acceptance above the trendline. Until that confirmation occurs, patience is required.

These tokens come from automatically converting trading fees into HYPE, they're already locked in an address with no private key, so they're effectively unreachable without a major hard fork.  The vote (validators decide by Dec 24) would officially remove them from both circulating supply (that's ~13% gone) and total supply (about 3.7% of the 1B cap). It's a deflationary move to clean up tokenomics, reduce FDV overhang (by roughly $1B at current prices), and signal stronger scarcity.  Right now, HYPE is trading around $26-$27, down a bit today but up 1-2% right after the announcement hit. The market likes it, open interest is climbing, and early validator votes (like Kinetiq) are in favor.  How does this change your $HYPE  target? It's bullish for the price. Removing that much supply (especially circulating) should support higher valuations over time, especially with Hyperliquid dominating perps volume and fees flowing into buybacks.

Longer term, this clears up a big overhang, analysts were already eyeing recovery from the recent dip (down 50%+ from ATH), and combined with things like the pending Bitwise spot ETF, targets like $40+ or even higher feel more realistic into 2026.

The Hyper Foundation has officially opened the validator vote to permanently burn 37.11 million  $HYPE tokens currently held in the Assistance Fund. While the market often views burns as simple \"hype\" events, this specific proposal represents a fundamental shift from discretionary fund management to pure algorithmic scarcity.\n​1. Establishing Permanent Social Consensus\n​The tokens in question are already held in a system address with no private key, making them mathematically inaccessible under current conditions. However, this vote is about something much deeper than a wallet balance. By passing this proposal, the community and validators are establishing a binding social consensus that no future protocol upgrade or hard fork will ever be used to retrieve these funds. This effectively deletes roughly 13% of the circulating supply and 3.7% of the total supply from the project's future forever.\n​2. The Death of the \"High FDV\" Narrative\n​One of the primary criticisms of high-performance Layer 1 and DeFi protocols is a bloated Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) that scares away long-term institutional investors. At current market prices, this burn permanently removes nearly $1 billion in value from the FDV. By slashing the \"shadow supply\" sitting in the Assistance Fund, Hyperliquid is making its valuation framework significantly more transparent and attractive to major players like Bitwise and Cantor Fitzgerald, who are already tracking the protocol’s massive $874M+ year-to-date fee revenue.\n​3. Strategic Transition to Autonomy\n​The \"Assistance Fund. \nBurning these tokens signals to the world that the protocol is now self-sustaining. The revenue generated by trading fees is now fueling a leaner, more efficient economic machine where the value accrues directly to the remaining holders rather than sitting in a foundation reserve.\n\n#Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights# #CMC","gravity_id":"372041403","id":33031,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T15:50:19.331Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T16:50:21.830Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2025-12-17T15:54:30.870Z","text_content":"🔥Burning 37M tokens is not a cosmetic move; it materially changes how the market should think about  $HYPE going forward. \n\nRemoving roughly 13% of supply from both circulating and total counts🤔, tightens the float and directly alters scarcity dynamics. \n\n💡If demand stays flat or improves, fewer tokens are now competing for the same capital, which explains the immediate reaction in price, open interest, and funding rates.\n\nMore importantly🧐, this signals governance maturity. \n\n📊Choosing to permanently retire tokens from the Assistance Fund shows a preference for long-term structural health🚀 over short-term flexibility. \n\n🚨For valuation, the focus shifts from future dilution risk to sustainability: liquidity conditions, protocol usage, and whether reduced supply #HYPE translates into steadier price discovery rather than sharp speculative spikes.\n#Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372042520","id":33055,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T16:00:25.533Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T16:50:21.645Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2025-12-17T16:28:58.649Z","text_content":"⚙️ Hyperliquid proposes scrapping $1B assistance fund  Governance proposal aims to remove the $1B Assistance Fund to realign incentives and strategic direction of the protocol.  #Hyperliquid  #governance  #fund  #crypto  $HYPE    https://crypto-economy.com/hyperliquid-proposes-governance-shift-to-eliminate-1b-assistance-fund/","gravity_id":"372044123","id":33125,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T16:30:19.767Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T17:00:21.788Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2025-12-17T16:24:39.238Z","text_content":"Hyperliquid is making waves with their bold proposal to burn 37,128,794.04 $HYPE  tokens from the Assistance Fund from the stash worth $1.01B, representing 3.713% of total supply and a whopping 10.943% of circulating supply. This isn’t just a symbolic gesture, It’s a deflationary plan to reshape the tokenomic narrative.  📉 $HYPE is already deflationary for different reasons. 1. No inflation: staking yield (2.2%) is paid from future emissions reserve. 2. HIP-1 native token fees are burned. 3. HyperEVM burns both base and priority fees thanks to HyperBFT consensus.  This is important because originally, the 37M was never meant to be spent and now with this, its ofically excluded. This burn will reduce supply and shift focus from short term holdings to long term plans. The buyback loop remains intact which funny enough is the real engine of Hyperliquid’s token model.

The successful approval of this vote could amplify bullish sentiment and support a price recovery, as it signals strong governance and alignment with investor interests.    2)Strengthened Deflationary Narrative  The burn proposal reinforces Hyperliquid's existing deflationary mechanisms, where 99% of platform fees are already used to buy back and burn HYPE tokens.   3)Improved Valuation Metrics for Institutions A key argument for the burn is that a high FDV (which included these reserve tokens) deterred large, mature funds from investing. By lowering the FDV, the token becomes more attractive to institutional investors, which could drive significant capital inflows and boost the price.  #Macro Insights#   #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372045103","id":33201,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T17:00:20.497Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T17:50:20.468Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2025-12-17T16:56:05.583Z","text_content":"🚨 1 BILLION HYPE TOKENS COULD BE BURNED  Hyperliquid wants validators to vote on burning nearly $1B in $HYPE  tokens from the Assistance Fund.
