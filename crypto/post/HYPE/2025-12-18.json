If approved through validator governance, the move would permanently remove more than 10–13% of circulating supply, reshaping HYPE’s tokenomics and forcing traders to reassess long-term price targets.  Bullish Case: Supply Shock Narrative Supporters argue the burn is a structural positive, framing it as a clean reset to HYPE’s supply dynamics. On X, many traders highlight that excluding the Assistance Fund from circulation strengthens scarcity, improves valuation optics, and aligns Hyperliquid with more disciplined token models. Some believe this could justify higher long-term price ceilings, especially if perpetuals volume and user activity remain strong.  Cautious Views: Governance and Demand Still Matter Not all reactions are euphoric. More conservative voices warn that the proposal is not finalized, as it hinges on validator approval. Others stress that while a burn tightens supply, it does not replace the need for sustained demand growth, trading volume, and ecosystem expansion. Without those, any price impact could be short-lived or purely speculative.  How Targets Are Shifting  Bullish traders are revising upside targets higher, citing the magnitude of the proposed burn relative to circulating supply.  Conclusion The consensus across Web3 is one of cautious optimism. Hyperliquid’s 37M HYPE burn proposal is widely viewed as a positive step for tokenomics, but its ultimate impact on price targets will depend on execution, validator approval, and whether network usage continues to justify tighter supply.

By reducing available tokens, this burn could enhance scarcity — a key driver for potential upward price pressure.  📊 Key Impacts to Watch: • Reduced Supply: A 37M token burn materially shrinks circulating supply, improving $HYPE ’s supply dynamics. • Market Sentiment: Buy-and-hold sentiment may strengthen as holders anticipate the long-term benefits of deflationary pressure. • Price Targets Reassessed: With lower effective supply, previous $HYPE  price models may need upward adjustment — especially if demand remains strong. • Short-Term Volatility: As with any major protocol event, markets may see heightened volatility around the burn execution.  💡 Bottom Line: The proposed burn positions $HYPE  for a more deflationary future.
