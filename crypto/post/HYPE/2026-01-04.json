Price Forecast Highlights (2025–2031) Experts are projecting a broad long-term uptrend for $HYPE : • 2025 potential up to ~$56 • 2026 range ~$68–$87 • 2027 could see $100+ • 2030 targets nearing $200+ • By 2031 some models place HYPE above $230 on average if adoption and liquidity expand.   These projections hinge on continued ecosystem growth, broader DeFi market strength, and real usage rather than just speculation.  Why This Matters Hyperliquid has captured major interest by bridging professional trading features (like deep order books and leverage) with true on-chain transparency.
