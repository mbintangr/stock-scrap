Instead of switching between tabs and dashboards, everything happens where the conversation already is.\n\nI literally typed something like “/trade long BNB 50x with $400” in the chat, and the trade executed. Positions, fills, and P&L update live in the same thread, making it feel social and easy to follow, especially when you’re trading alongside others.\n\nWhat surprised me most is how natural it feels.
