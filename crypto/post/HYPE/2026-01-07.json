A Look at the Top Exchanges\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nWith new cryptocurrencies launching every day, you might wonder how to access the widest range of coins while also steering clear of scams and poorly conceived projects. Here we break down the key points and compare leading global exchanges—including Bitget, Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, Uniswap, and Hyperliquid  $HYPE, so you can trade wisely in 2026.\n\n\nWhy Starting with a CEX is Often the Wise Choice\n\nCEXs are best for most users, offering support, easy access, and safety filters. DEXs offer unrestricted access to new tokens, but with high risk of scams. Only use DEXs if you have the expertise to vet projects yourself.\n\nHow Leading Exchanges Compare on Selection and Safety\n\n- Bitget leads centralized exchanges with over 1,543 assets, pairing fast new listings with ongoing due diligence to help users find trending coins early without compromising on safety. \n- Binance also lists coins quickly and offers a wide selection, though its pace can sometimes mean riskier additions. \n- Coinbase and Kraken prioritize long-term security and regulatory compliance, resulting in a more cautious, smaller selection of listed coins. \n- DEXs like Uniswap offer the largest theoretical range—over 16,000 assets—but provide no protection against scam tokens.\n\nFinding the Right Platform for Your Experience Level\n\nStart with a reputable centralized exchange like Bitget for a blend of variety and safety. Use DEXs only if you are an experienced user who can handle high risk. For maximum security, pick platforms with proof of reserves, insurance, and clear delisting policies.\n\nThe Essential Rule\nAlways do your own research (DYOR). Verify every token yourself before investing, regardless of the platform's reputation.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhich exchange has the most coins?\nBitget leads centralized exchanges with over 1,543 coins.
