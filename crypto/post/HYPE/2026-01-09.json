Next come perp DEXes, followed by staking and lending—mostly to borrow those same stablecoins!  I'll repeat a thought I voiced about two years ago: Blockchain as a phenomenon is great! But all we really need is a couple of networks and stablecoins! When we're talking about mass adoption, we just need the ability to use money for everyday transactions powered by simple blockchain technology!  And that's the core problem with altcoins right now: there are far too many projects that simply raise funds, allocate tokens to themselves and to cartels posing as participants in private rounds, then dump everything on the market—while showing you some random token unlock schedule chart—and the cycle repeats!

Despite short-term attempts to stabilize, the broader trend remains negative as sellers defend key resistance zones.  Market Structure Overview:  - $HYPE   continues to print lower highs and lower lows, confirming bearish dominance.  - Recent recovery attempts were rejected below major resistance, reinforcing downside bias.  - Momentum remains weak, suggesting limited bullish conviction at current levels.  Key Technical Levels:  Resistance: $28 A critical supply zone where prior rebounds have failed.  Support: $19 The next significant downside level, which may act as a liquidity and demand area if selling pressure persists.  Price Action Context:  After peaking earlier in the cycle, HYPE has undergone a prolonged corrective phase. The inability to reclaim former support levels has kept price structurally weak, with rallies increasingly sold into rather than extended.  Outlook:  Unless HYPE can break above resistance and invalidate the current bearish structure, downside continuation remains the higher-probability scenario. Market participants are closely monitoring the $19 region for potential stabilization or further breakdown signals.

This suggests that long traders are still paying to maintain exposure, which increases downside risk if selling pressure intensifies. In a declining trend, positive funding typically reflects position imbalance rather than market strength.  Pressure may ease only if funding normalizes or the price structure improves.  $HYPE   derivatives are available for trading on #BingX.  #CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#  #CMC Launch: Aster#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372704561","id":76035,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T11:50:23.742Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T15:30:26.296Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-09T11:55:45.025Z","text_content":"Breaking news from yesterday\n\n- Florida announced bill to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve allowing up to 10% of its public funds to be held in BTC and ETFs\n\n- ZCASH announces they are launching a ZCASH wallet, coming shortly after recent ZEC dump following several core devs departure \n\n- Binance launched Gold and Silver futures trading \n\n- Flare shipped XRP spot trading to Hyperliquid \n\n- Fluent launched Prints, a reputation based social footprint \n\n- Truebit lost around 8,535 ETH ($26.6 million) in a security breach on Thursday seeing their native token TRU dip 99.9%\n\n- Colombian authorities are mandating crypto exchanges to submit user data \n\n- Trumps states that he have no plans to give a presidential pardon to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried\n\n- Morgan Stanley plans to launch its own digital wallet this year that will support all kinds of tokenized assets","gravity_id":"372702119","id":76040,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T12:00:03.042Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T15:40:25.178Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-09T12:00:00.191Z","text_content":"Here’s Why #Hyperliquid  (HYPE) Needs Derivatives Before Wall Street Can Touch It  $HYPE    https://captainaltcoin.com/heres-why-hyperliquid-hype-needs-derivatives-before-wall-street-can-touch-it/","gravity_id":"372705628","id":76059,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T12:00:22.552Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T16:00:27.071Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-09T11:49:45.128Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nAfter two years of silence, a whale has deposited $2.64 million into HyperLiquid for the first time and bought HYPE.\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372702089","id":76060,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T12:00:23.008Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T15:40:25.411Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-09T12:26:48.277Z","text_content":"🔰 PAIR: #HYPE/ USDT 💹\n\n\n🟢 Position: LONG🚀\n\n\n☑️ Entry Zone:\n💠 26.08\n💠 26.00\n\n\n🌐 Leverage: Cross • 50X ⚡🔥\n\n\n🎯 Take Profit Targets:\n🥇 26.17\n🥈 26.24\n🥉 26.35\n\n\n❌ Stop Loss: 25.92🔴\n$HYPE","gravity_id":"372705767","id":76112,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T12:30:23.848Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T16:10:27.877Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-09T13:01:45.052Z","text_content":"If I had to choose only one perps airdrop to farm right now, it would be Extended\n\n• 30% of its token supply is confirmed to be airdropped at TGE\n• It is built by an ex-Revolut team\n• offers deep liquidity for most assets\n• Active traders earn 25-50% APR on their trading collateral\n• its TGE will happen in Q2\n• has a strong community, similar to Lighter and Hyperliquid in the early days\n• It's one of the fastest-growing perps DEXs by trading volume and TVL\n\nThe most interesting thing, in my opinion, about Extended is its market-making vault design.\n\nWhen you deposit USDC into the Extended vault, you get vault shares (XVS tokens). XVS can then be used as collateral for trading and has a 5-15% base APR.\n\nBut on top of this, XVS holders earn an extra yield (up to 50% APR) based on their weekly trading activity.\n\nThis yield comes from Extended trading fees.\n\nSo you're actually getting a high double-digit yield on the funds you use for trading, while also earning points at the same time.\n\nThis seems like a great yield opportunity for stables, especially in the current market conditions.\n\nIf you wish to farm Extended, you can use my link for a 10% points boost + lower fees:\nhttps://t.co/TCKgnspZBW\n\nBoth Hyperliquid and Lighter have done massive airdrops. I think there's a high chance that we'll continue to see big airdrops from perps DEXs.\n\nNote: I wasn't compensated by the Extended team to write this post. I am covering it only because I believe its airdrop is worth farming.","gravity_id":"372703470","id":76176,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T13:10:24.845Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T16:40:26.068Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-09T13:40:00.135Z","text_content":"📊 Grayscale takes first step toward BNB and HYPE ETFs  Grayscale filed initial paperwork that could lead to ETFs tracking $BNB  and $HYPE .  #Grayscale  #BNB  #HYPE  #ETFs  #Crypto   https://crypto-economy.com/grayscale-takes-early-step-toward-launching-bnb-and-hype-etfs/","gravity_id":"372703683","id":76226,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T13:40:23.268Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T17:10:24.871Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-09T13:52:45.027Z","text_content":"Swap cross-chain into $HYPE and any other asset on HyperEVM with Rubic’s Best Rate Finder.\n\nBest rates on-chain & cross-chain are powered by\n@symbiosis_fi, @squidrouter, @debridge, @AcrossProtocol, @lifiprotocol, @RelayProtocol, @SimpleSwap_io, @Changelly_team & @OpenOceanGlobal.
