A big part of it feels like unlock nerves. The monthly team unlock cadence is now “real,” and even if the actual sell pressure is smaller than people fear, traders don’t wait around — they’ll front-run the idea of supply hitting the market 🧊  Also, buybacks are great… but right now they’re not the headline 🪙 The vibe has shifted to: “ok cool, but is revenue staying strong?” + “how much supply is coming?” So buybacks have started to feel more like background support than a price engine.  Technically, HYPE also had that classic failed push higher. It tried to reclaim the ~$30-ish area recently, got swatted down, and once momentum fades you usually see quick sellers + stop runs kick in 📉  And because HYPE is super trader-heavy, when perps cool off (OI drops / longs get cleaned out), it can slide faster than people expect ⚡  What I’m watching from here 👀 • Does it hold ~$24 and chill (good sign), or lose it and turn that level into resistance (pain)? • Can it get back into the mid-$20s and start printing higher lows again? • Next unlock date — do we finally get a “sell the rumor, buy the news” moment for once? 😭  Bottom line: this looks more like supply + positioning pressure than “something is broken.” But near-term, the chart still needs to stop bleeding before any bigger narrative stuff (institutional chatter, etc.) really matters. 🧠📊","gravity_id":"372726876","id":77667,"createdAt":"2026-01-10T09:00:30.418Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-10T14:50:26.919Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-10T08:55:25.916Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $HYPE  hyperliquid towards $44 , Time to Buy Now, if you want back higher Profit!!
