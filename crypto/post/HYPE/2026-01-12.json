Hyperliquid $HYPE   is trading at $24.05, down 1.31% in the last 24 hours, as the token experiences mild consolidation after recent market activity. The pullback comes despite solid fundamentals, with HYPE maintaining a strong market cap of $8.16B. One key factor behind today’s dip is cooling momentum, as 24-hour trading volume fell to $157.33M, down 80.07%, signaling reduced short-term trader participation.  The volume-to-market cap ratio of 1.92% suggests healthy but quieter trading conditions, often seen during pauses after strong moves. With a circulating supply of 339.34M HYPE out of a fixed 961.67M max supply, supply dynamics remain controlled, but near-term price action is more influenced by sentiment than fundamentals. Overall, today’s decline appears driven by profit-taking and lower volume, not structural weakness in the Hyperliquid ecosystem.  #Hyperliquid  #HYPE  #CryptoMarket  #Altcoins  #CryptoNews","gravity_id":"372776123","id":81307,"createdAt":"2026-01-12T12:10:29.044Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T17:50:28.263Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-12T13:31:45.051Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nWeekend Top Perp DEX Overview: All platform volumes remain below $3B, with Hyperliquid holding the top spot\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372779166","id":81486,"createdAt":"2026-01-12T13:40:27.270Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T17:50:28.008Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-12T16:23:57.506Z","text_content":"$HYPE  has broken the 23.8 – 23.5 key support, sweeping all late buyer liquidity.
