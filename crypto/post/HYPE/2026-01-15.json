At the moment, there’s no bias being forced. The market needs to show its hand first. Until structure confirms, it’s simply an area of interest rather than an active trade.  The Monday high and the yearly open are key reference levels. If price reaches these levels and manages to flip them into support with clear structural continuation, they can just as easily become a valid point of interest for a long setup.  In other words, the level itself isn’t bullish or bearish on its own. The reaction and follow-through are what matter. If the flip holds and continuation follows, the long thesis becomes valid. If not, it’s just another level to respect and move on from. #BNBChain#  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372850319","id":86466,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T19:20:14.798Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T09:40:19.402Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-14T22:01:45.066Z","text_content":"HYPE: THE 37 MILLION TOKEN BURN\n\nHyperliquid validators have officially voted to recognize 37 million HYPE tokens in the Assistance Fund as permanently burned. \n\nThis move represents a 13 percent reduction in total supply and introduces a permanent deflationary mechanic to the ecosystem. \n\nWhile the platform just hit a record 7 billion dollars in 24 hour perpetual volume, this supply crunch is designed to offset the inflationary pressure from recent team unlocks.","gravity_id":"372855039","id":86691,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T22:10:16.197Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T09:40:19.251Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-15T02:21:38.688Z","text_content":"$HYPE hype will be $000.3","gravity_id":"372859602","id":86918,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T02:30:15.771Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T10:50:19.807Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-15T02:21:16.674Z","text_content":"$HYPE more better bnb","gravity_id":"372860563","id":86919,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T02:30:15.920Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T09:40:19.099Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-15T03:14:29.536Z","text_content":"$HYPE BIG SCAMMER","gravity_id":"372859900","id":86952,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T03:20:16.588Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T12:10:19.641Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-15T03:57:07.784Z","text_content":"$HYPE Lower lows coming.

In a recent update, Hyperliquid’s founder made it clear that $HYPE  is focused on building alternative financial infrastructure, not benchmarking itself against CEX volumes or playing the “ #Binance  rival” game.  Tbh DeFi doesn’t need to outgun centralized platforms on raw liquidity to be valuable. Its edge is permissionless access, composability, and infra that works without custodians or gatekeepers.  This same mindset is showing up across the next wave of infra-focused networks like Haust.  Haust is approaching the problem from the user execution layer. Instead of chasing surface metrics, it’s building systems that reduce friction at the moment of action: intent-based transactions, account abstraction, native DEXs, and AI-driven execution through HAIA.  What’s important to understand here is that the philosophy remains the same. Build rails that do things centralized platforms can’t, rather than copying what they already do well.  That’s usually how real infrastructure wins over time.  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372850159","id":87125,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T06:10:18.109Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T09:00:19.542Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-15T07:06:19.587Z","text_content":"$HYPE BIG SCAMMER HYPE","gravity_id":"372863282","id":87200,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T07:10:16.673Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T13:10:22.156Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-15T07:21:27.798Z","text_content":"$HYPE it about to go way up","gravity_id":"372864394","id":87228,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T07:30:15.917Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T13:30:29.756Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-15T09:07:20.514Z","text_content":"$HYPE   – Reversal Signs?
