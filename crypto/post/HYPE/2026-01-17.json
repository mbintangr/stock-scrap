Despite the defensive flows, Open Interest for this weekend is heavily skewed towards bullish targets. Traders are aggressively positioning for a breakout, with massive Call walls stacked at $97.5k and the psychological $100K barrier.  Key Altcoin Watch: Smart money isn't just watching Bitcoin. Speculative rotation is heating up in the altcoin sector, with notable Call buying activity detected in Ethena ($ENA ) and Hyperliquid ($HYPE ) ahead of Sunday's expirations.  Expectation: Expect a volatile weekend as bearish hedging collides with bullish expiration targets.
