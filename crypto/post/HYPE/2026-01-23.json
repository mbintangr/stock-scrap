Price rejected strongly from the 21.70–21.80 zone and printed a sharp sell-off, confirming sellers are still in control. The recent bounce attempt was weak and immediately sold into, which usually signals distribution rather than a trend reversal.\n\nPrice is now trading below the previous support area, turning it into resistance. As long as HYPE stays below the 21.60–21.80 zone, downside continuation remains likely.

That’s the last meaningful support on the chart.
