HYPE continues to hold the market's attention: the current price is around $23.3, up +10% over the last 24 hours, accompanied by an increase in volume to $210+ million. Over a 7-day period, the dynamics remain mixed, and over 30 days, it is clear that the token is still digesting the previous correction after December's highs. The market is gradually regaining interest, but it is doing so without a sharp FOMO — and this is an important signal. On the 4H chart, HYPE is forming a recovery structure after a sharp decline to the $20–21 zone, which acted as key support. The current rebound has brought the price back above $22.5, and the nearest resistance is in the $25–26 range — this is where large sales volumes previously took place. So far, the movement looks like a technical retest, but consolidation above $26 could change the scenario towards a continuation of the trend. The probability of moderate growth in the medium term is estimated at approximately 55%, provided that interest and market stability are maintained.  STONfi, a DEX in the TON ecosystem focused on fast and transparent on-chain operations, comes to the fore here. Unlike CEX, where the user depends on the platform's rules, STONfi works through smart contracts: no custodial storage, no hidden restrictions, and complete on-chain transparency. This is especially important during periods of sharp movements, when control over assets becomes a critical factor. STONfi is gradually becoming a tool for those who view DeFi as part of a long-term strategy in TON: convenient exchange, understandable commission logic, and high network throughput allow you to respond to market volatility calmly and consciously. Against the backdrop of HYPE fluctuations, such solutions seem increasingly relevant.

It’s up over 6% at around $22.89, holding above the $20 short-term support, which feels like an important base for now. On-chain activity is mixed but interesting a large transfer of 665,000 HYPE (~$14.5M) to Bybit suggests some profit-taking, while other big wallets appear to be quietly accumulating, particularly around yield strategies.   On the derivatives side, participation is clearly rising, with Open Interest climbing 18% to $1.82B and volume up 24%. Momentum indicators such as Stochastic RSI and Accumulation/Distribution are pointing to renewed buying pressure.   Price is now testing resistance near $24 within a descending channel. A decisive break could shift momentum toward $30–$40, while a rejection would likely keep $HYPE   ranging for a bit longer.
