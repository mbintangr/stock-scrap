HYPE remains in the market spotlight: the price is holding steady at around $23.3, adding about 10% over the past 24 hours. The growth is accompanied by an increase in trading activity — the daily volume exceeded $210 million. On a weekly timeframe, the movement looks ambiguous, and in a 30-day perspective, it is noticeable that the token is still going through a stabilization phase after the December correction from local highs. Market interest is gradually returning, without any pronounced FOMO, which can be seen as a healthy sign. The 4-hour chart shows a recovery pattern forming after a sharp decline to the $20–21 area, which acted as key support. The current rebound has allowed the price to return above $22.5, but the nearest serious resistance is in the $25–26 zone, where active position fixing was previously observed. So far, the movement looks like a technical retest, but a confident consolidation above $26 could change the picture in favor of a continuation of the trend. The probability of moderate growth in the medium term is estimated at approximately 55%, with interest and a stable market background remaining.  Against this backdrop, STONfi looks particularly relevant — a decentralized exchange in the TON ecosystem focused on fast and transparent on-chain operations. Unlike CEX, where users are dependent on the platform's internal rules, STONfi operates through smart contracts: without custodial storage, hidden restrictions, and with complete transparency of all actions.
