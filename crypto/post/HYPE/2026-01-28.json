Messari mentions that Uquid, a multichain Web3 shopping platform, recorded its largest transaction volume on TRON during 2025.   This is interesting because most discussions around TRON usually focus on stablecoin transfers or DeFi-related activity. Seeing a commerce-focused platform showing meaningful volume suggests that a portion of TRON’s usage is tied to actual consumer payments, not just financial primitives.   If this trend continues, it could indicate that TRON’s infrastructure is increasingly being used for real-world payment use cases, especially in regions where crypto payments are already practical.

While broader crypto flows remain selective, Hyperliquid is attracting a non-crypto-native trader base, reshaping short-term demand for HYPE.  Following the HIP-3 expansion, Silver perpetuals rapidly became one of Hyperliquid’s most traded instruments, pushing commodity notional volume beyond $1B/day. This matters structurally: commodity traders are typically less sensitive to crypto volatility and more focused on macro exposure. Their activity feeds directly into Hyperliquid’s fee engine, strengthening HYPE’s value accrual loop. Importantly, elevated volumes have persisted across multiple sessions, signaling organic demand rather than incentive-driven spikes.  As of Jan 28, 2026, total HIP-3 Open Interest reached $920.9M, one of the strongest sustained expansions since launch. Positioning is concentrated, with a single contract contributing $803.3M, indicating large directional exposure rather than fragmented retail flow. Additional markets (HYNA $64.9M, FLX $22.0M) confirm broader suite participation. Rising OI alongside high volume reduces leverage-only risk and aligns with institutional-style positioning.  HYPE has broken its descending channel and is up 40%+ from recent lows. Short-term MAs are turning upward, signaling trend reversal. A clean break above the 200-day EMA at $38 keeps $50 in focus. On pullbacks, $30–28 remains the key higher-low zone; a loss of $25 would invalidate the near-term bullish structure.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373281345","id":106879,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T13:40:19.829Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T14:10:21.878Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-28T13:48:50.687Z","text_content":"I’m long on $ASTER  — it just broke a major resistance level.\r \r I’ve entered with the first portion of my position.\r \r If we pull back to $0.65, I’ll add the second size.\r Next level would be $0.60 — then I simply hold.\r My thesis is clear:\r \r If it continues higher, I’m happy with the first entry.\r \r If it dips, I’m happy to add more.\r \r If it dips further, I’m even happier to DCA.\r \r Target for profit-taking is around $0.80.\r \r This is either a quick scalp — or a 2–5 day swing.\r \r I expect it to move fast, especially after $HYPE  already had a strong run.\r #ASTER   usually follows.\r \r Let’s go.","gravity_id":"373278880","id":106901,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T13:50:19.282Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T14:30:21.294Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-28T13:48:19.646Z","text_content":"HYPERLIQUID ($HYPE ) Prints a 100x on Polymarket  $HYPE  surged 50% this week in spot markets, but the real fireworks happened on Polymarket.

Wallet setup, network errors, gas confusion — friction everywhere. @ston_fi  flips that entire experience on its head.  You don’t create an account. You don’t hand over data. You don’t pass KYC. You open STONfi, connect a $TON  wallet, and you’re live. That’s it. The platform is fully non-custodial, so control never leaves your wallet, and the mental barrier that scares new users simply disappears.  The wallet connection itself feels almost too easy. One click on desktop, a quick QR scan on mobile, approval done. No network switching, no RPC configs, no juggling gas tokens. Because STONfi is native to TON, everything works out of the box.  What really sets it apart is Telegram. STONfi runs directly inside Telegram mini-apps, meaning swaps can happen inside the same app people already use every day. No browser tabs, no extensions, no learning curve. DeFi starts to feel like a normal mobile product.  Add fast finality, ultra-low fees, a clean interface, and clear step-by-step guides, and the result is simple: STONfi removes nearly every obstacle that makes DeFi hard. It’s not just accessible — it’s intentionally effortless.  #TON  $HYPE  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#  #HYPE  $TON  #Bullish","gravity_id":"373282548","id":106968,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T14:20:19.161Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T15:00:20.583Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-28T14:15:27.719Z","text_content":"$HYPE  or Reality?

It’s a tokenized version of Apple stock living natively on TON, meaning exposure to AAPL straight from your wallet — no accounts, no KYC checks, no legacy rails slowing things down.  The entry point is @ston_fi , where xStocks are integrated directly into the swap interface. You connect your TON wallet, choose AAPLx, confirm the disclaimer, and swap TON for Apple exposure in seconds. No extra steps, no complex setup — it feels like trading any other token.  Behind that simplicity is Omniston, TON’s liquidity aggregator. Instead of relying only on AMM pools, xStocks trades are routed through a dedicated escrow path tied to the asset issuer. This gives access to deeper liquidity, tighter pricing, and far lower slippage, especially for larger orders.  Once you confirm, TON moves into escrow, AAPLx lands in your wallet, and settlement completes in roughly five seconds — fully on-chain, fully self-custodied. Your wallet displays clean, readable balances automatically.  The result is straightforward: fast execution, low fees, real stock exposure, all inside TON and even Telegram. For many traders, this is smoother than using a traditional broker — you just swap and move on.
