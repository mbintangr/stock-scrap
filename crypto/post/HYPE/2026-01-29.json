Price moved fast into resistance, and short-term extensions look stretched. These kinds of vertical moves often cool off with either consolidation or a pullback before continuation. Chasing strength here feels risky.  My take: structurally bullish, tactically cautious. I’m watching how price behaves around the $30–32 zone. If it holds and builds a base, continuation is on the table. If not, patience pays.

After successfully bottoming near the $20.00 demand zone earlier this month, the asset has broken its long-term descending channel.

Medium-term: If HYPE decisively flips the daily $38.37 MA 200 into support, the path toward the $50.00–$60.00 range is wide open, driven by the exhausted selling pressure from early January unlocks.  📈⚖️ #HYPE  #PriceAction","gravity_id":"373315446","id":109646,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T16:40:21.274Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T17:50:21.312Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-29T16:37:45.147Z","text_content":"Why chase $UNI and $HYPE when you can just participate in ZKP’s $5M giveaway? 🤑 The more you engage, the more you gain! 🚀  \n\n👉 https://coinlineup.com/zkp-gains-momentum-with-a-5m-giveaway-and-live-presale-auctions-uni-drops-hype-stalls   \n\n#Crypto #ZKP #Giveaway #InvestSmart #HODL ","gravity_id":"373315438","id":109647,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T16:40:21.454Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T17:50:21.489Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-29T16:37:37.292Z","text_content":"HYPE team trimming the unlocks ✂ Feels bullish AF.
