Trade $HYPE  👉 https://app.stobix.com/futures/HYPE/USDT?utm_source=cmc&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=hype-usdt-futures-2026-01-31   $HYPE  is consolidating after a strong rebound, holding above a critical support zone as traders assess whether Hyperliquid’s growing dominance can fuel another leg higher.  📊 Market Snapshot (Jan 31) • Price: ~$28.0 • 24h range: ~$27.6 – $29.4 • Volume (24h): Elevated, tracking strong perps activity  🧭 Key Technical Levels • Immediate support: $28.0 • Lower support: $25.0 – $26.0 • Near-term resistance: $30.0 • Breakout target: $36.0  🛠 What’s Influencing $HYPE  • Hyperliquid’s market share surged from 18% to 33% in January • Equity & commodity perps (HIP-3) now drive ~30% of total volume • Weekly protocol revenue climbed from $11M → $15.5M, supporting buybacks & burns • Non-crypto assets like gold and silver are now among top-traded markets  📈 Short-Term Outlook • Hold above $28: structure remains bullish, with room for a push toward $30 and $36 • Lose $28: price risks falling back into the $20–$28 consolidation range • Rising volume + revenue growth strengthens the bullish setup  📌 Bottom Line $HYPE  is sitting on a pivotal support zone. If bulls successfully defend $28 and equity-perps momentum continues, Hyperliquid could attempt a breakout toward $36. A loss of support, however, would delay the recovery and keep price range-bound. #HYPE  #Hyperliquid  #Altcoins  #CryptoNews  #Perpetuals","gravity_id":"373380600","id":113880,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T12:30:20.238Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T14:30:22.380Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-31T13:19:45.062Z","text_content":"Hyperliquid Defies Trends and Surges in a Bear Market https://ift.tt/KQXZshJ","gravity_id":"373378598","id":113962,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T13:20:21.250Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T16:30:20.125Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-31T13:16:45.085Z","text_content":"Weekly Project Updates: Over 30,000 ERC-8004 Trustless Agents Registered, Jupiter Launches Offerbook Lending, Lighter Unveils LighterEVM, Lido V3 Goes Live, Hyperliquid Tops Binance in Liquidity, Optimism Approves OP Buybacks, Story Delays Token Unlock, etc https://t.co/hW9ebFab0V","gravity_id":"373381912","id":113963,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T13:20:21.445Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T16:10:25.129Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-31T13:10:45.221Z","text_content":"Hyperliquid Defies Broader Bear Market as RWA Integration Drives HYPE Demand -  https://cryptonewsmax.com/hyperliquid-defies-broader-bear-market-as-rwa-integration-drives-hype-demand/  $BTC $ETH #crypto #bitcoin #blockchain #cryptonewsmax","gravity_id":"373381876","id":113964,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T13:20:21.651Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T15:40:23.368Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-31T13:35:31.327Z","text_content":"THE $HYPE HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE 🌞 \n\nHere’s why  $HYPE is pumping and you should still buy:\n\n→ HIP-3 explosion: Permissionless perps on real-world assets (silver/gold/commodities) and Silver alone hit $1B+ volume on most days.\n\n→ Institutional accumulation: DATs (e.g., Hyperliquid Strategies) stacking aggressively.\n\n→ High-profile endorsements: Circle CEO shilled at WEF, Tether CEO calls it the everything exchange, Citrini (big research firm) bullposted it, and  $HYPE ETF rumors swirling.\n\n→ Better than CEX: Hyperliquid BTC pair now deeper than Binance at all times.\n\nI have been accumulating for a while and don’t plan to stop anytime soon.\n\nFollow me for more news and updates!\n#HYPE #Macro Insights# #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"373382006","id":114008,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T13:40:22.336Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T16:50:21.337Z"},{"crypto_id":"32196","crypto_name":"HYPE","post_time":"2026-01-31T14:17:04.342Z","text_content":"$HYPE Captured a part of this move as a scalp but already out; will be happy to get back in soon depending on price action.
