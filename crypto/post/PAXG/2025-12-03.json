Watch for reversal signals as a confirmation to strike long. If bullish momentum ignites, initial targets lie at 4237 and the prior swing high of 4283, potentially stretching to 4346. However, an aggressive breakdown below 4166 could signal the bears pressing onward toward sparser support around 4034 and 3996. Guard against false moves by placing a stop-loss just below 4166, monitoring for decisive bullish patterns to monetize upside potential.\r \r 🎯 Every professional trader uses AI.
