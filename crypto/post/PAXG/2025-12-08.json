This area could spark a short-term rebound toward resistance just above 4211.\r \r Watch for bullish confirmation patterns near 4202-4204 to validate a potential bounce targeting the 4211 resistance. A break below 4202.45 would likely extend bearish momentum. The broader trend remains negative until prices overcome the supply zone near 4215. This is only a partial view.

Will the bulls steer $PAXG  through the resistance nebula ahead or face a cosmic pullback?\r \r On the daily chart, $PAXG  currently rides a bullish tide right above the recent high around 4205, signaling robust buying gravity. However, ahead looms a resistance belt between 4330 and 4670, dense with supply constellations that could halt ascent. Support anchors linger near 4120, providing a key safety net. Mixed momentum indicators add turbulence — bullish engines like Vortex and ADX push upward, while weakening signals from MACD and RSI caution caution. A confirmed bullish reversal near 4200-4213, reinforced by lower timeframe buy patterns, could chart a course to the resistance zone. Should bears breach 4120, watch for a retreat toward 3996 support. This battle report is only a glimpse.
