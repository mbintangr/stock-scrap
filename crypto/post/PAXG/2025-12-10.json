This range has acted as a short-term support multiple times, and every dip toward it is getting absorbed quickly, which signals buyers quietly defending the level. If momentum picks up from here, a push toward the recent intraday highs could unfold, but a break below the support area may invite a deeper pullback.\n\nTargets\n\n4,220\n\n4,227\n\n\nStop Loss\n\n4,205","gravity_id":"371802842","id":16703,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T08:00:12.131Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T17:50:13.851Z"}]
