Record highs in leading miners, growing state-level interest in tokenization, and steady ETF flows all reinforce the metal’s role as a strategic asset going into 2026.\n\nMarket trends\n• Geopolitical driver: governments deepen their exploration of blockchain and tokenization. Pakistan is in talks with Binance to tokenize up to $2B in state assets, potentially tying gold more directly into digital public-finance rails.\n• ETF demand: issuance of gold ETCs remains active. Xtrackers added 65,000 new units, while Amundi placed several fresh tranches last week, signaling ongoing institutional demand.\n• Macro backdrop: expectations of slower growth in India and a weaker rupee into 2026 could support local gold buying as a store of value.\n\nTechs\nSupport: $4,250–4,300 (current consolidation zone)\nResistance: $4,450–4,500 (a breakout opens room toward $4,600)\n\nEquities\nGold miners continue to rip higher, with multiple majors printing fresh highs as strategic deals close and balance sheets strengthen.\n• Record highs:\n– Kinross Gold ($28.81)\n– Barrick Mining ($43.10)\n– Newmont Goldcorp ($98.75)\n– Wheaton Precious Metals ($114.49)\nThese levels reflect strong confidence in sustained margins and cash flows.\n• Deals & funding:\n– Aris Mining completes its acquisition of the remaining 49 percent of Soto Norte, fully consolidating a key asset.\n– Gold Royalty closes a $103.5M equity raise; Scotiabank lifts its target to $5.00.\n– Streamex acquires 9.9 percent of Empress Royalty via share exchange, deepening its royalty exposure.\n• Other developments:\n– The Tahltan Nation approves an agreement on the Eskay Creek project in Canada, reducing permitting risk and clearing the way for development.\n– VCI Global shuts down a credit facility to shift focus toward digital-asset opportunities.\n\nCrypto vs Gold\nTension between crypto narratives and real-asset cash flows sharpens.\n• Bitcoin: Peter Schiff escalates his criticism, comparing Michael Saylor to Sam Bankman-Fried, underscoring rising doubts about the sustainability of highly leveraged BTC strategies.\n• Gold: continues to strengthen its position through blockchain integration. Pakistan’s tokenization plans highlight gold’s role as high-quality collateral in a digital context. Record highs in Newmont and Barrick underline that this sector is built on operating mines and cash flow rather than purely on sentiment.\nTakeaway: while crypto battles reputational and governance issues, the gold sector showcases corporate maturity and operational resilience at record price levels.\n\nWhat to watch\n• Year-end inflation and retail-sales data in major economies.\n• Central-bank commentary from the Fed and peers as they wrap up 2025.\n• Gold’s ability to hold above $4,300 and whether miners can defend recent gains.\n• Further announcements on state-level tokenization initiatives using gold as collateral.\n\nTakeaways\n• Gold: holding above $4,250 into year-end sets a constructive tone for 2026. The $4,250–4,300 band acts as support, with $4,500 still a realistic target for Q1 if macro conditions don’t deteriorate. Geopolitical interest in gold-backed tokenization is emerging as a new structural driver.\n• Miners: record highs in leading producers and royalty names reflect a re-rating of the sector. A selective approach is key: focus on companies with strong balance sheets, disciplined capital allocation, and credible dividend or royalty profiles (Newmont, Barrick, Wheaton, quality royalty players).\n• Crypto: extreme caution remains warranted. Intensifying criticism from figures like Schiff raise reputational and structural risks, making gold the safer choice for conservative capital.\n\nNot financial advice.
