The overall trend remains bearish but short-term bullish signals are emerging.\r \r Watch for a break above resistance around 4362, which could trigger a reversal pattern and lead to a short. Alternatively, support near 4321 could hold for a bounce, but a break below 4320 would increase bearish pressure targeting lower lows. Confirmation is key before any commitment.

It tried to push through but the sellers stepped in immediately, dragging it back down into this choppy range we've been sitting in for the last day.\nRight now, we are hovering right in the middle of nowhere. If it can't hold this 4340 area, I’m looking at 4310 as the next real spot where buyers might actually show up.\nThe volume is looking a bit thin on this current bounce so I’m not chasing anything here. I’d rather wait to see if it flushes one more time or actually clears that 4360 resistance with some real strength before I get interested.\nStay patient.
