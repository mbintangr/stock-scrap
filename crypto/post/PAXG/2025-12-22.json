PAX Gold $PAXG   is trading at $4,409.95, up 1.31% in the last 24 hours, as investors rotate toward safe-haven assets amid ongoing market uncertainty. Its market cap has climbed to $1.54B, closely tracking the price movement of physical gold.  The biggest driver behind today’s rise is a massive 199% surge in 24-hour trading volume to $79.66M, signaling strong demand from traders and institutions seeking stability. With 100% of its 350.9K supply already circulating, PAXG avoids inflation pressure, making it attractive during volatile market conditions. As gold prices strengthen globally, tokenized gold assets like PAXG continue to benefit from growing interest in on-chain, asset-backed alternatives.  #PAXG  #GoldBackedCrypto  #SafeHaven  #CryptoMarket  #TokenizedAssets","gravity_id":"372182830","id":42551,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T05:20:20.759Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-22T17:50:21.776Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2025-12-22T05:23:36.622Z","text_content":"JUST IN: #Gold  reaches new all-time high of $4,400 $PAXG","gravity_id":"372182904","id":42562,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T05:30:20.514Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-22T17:50:21.548Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2025-12-22T05:37:22.684Z","text_content":"RSI Overbought(1h) 1.
