But the vast majority of L1s use cryptography that is vulnerable to the inevitable threat of quantum computing.  IOTA solves this by using a quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithm, providing long-term security for tokenized assets and digital identities.   This makes the IOTA a far more secure choice for storing multi-generational RWA like real estate and permanent records.  This is the future of secure, long-term asset custody.  Secure your assets.

Massive ETF issuance, gold-linked bond deals, and record silver performance show investors still treating precious metals as core hedges amid expectations of easier policy and persistent geopolitical risk.\n\nMarket trends\n• Institutional backbone: gold stabilizes at historic highs, balancing strong fundamentals with some profit-taking. Goldman Sachs sees prices reaching $4,900 by end-2026, driven by central-bank demand and a Fed easing cycle.\n• Geopolitics: rising tension around Venezuela supports demand for safe havens, helping keep a firm floor under gold.\n• ETF wave: Xtrackers, Amundi and others report heavy issuance, while iShares Physical Metals alone issued 1.7M new ETC units over the last two weeks, underscoring gold’s role in long-term asset-allocation models.\n\nTechs\nSupport: $4,300–4,350 (current consolidation band)\nResistance: $4,500–4,550 (breakout opens a path toward Goldman’s $4,900 target)\n\nEquities\nGold equities show a mixed picture at record price levels, with capital rotating toward M&A stories and higher-upside juniors.\n• Consolidation:\n– New Gold shareholders vote on a $20B deal with Coeur Mining.\n– Revival Gold acquires Barrick’s stake in the Mercur project, signaling continued portfolio reshaping.\n• Growth projects:\n– KEFI Gold and Copper raises $30M for Tulu Kapi, shining a spotlight on high-potential development assets.\n– Yakutia’s plan to ramp up output to 75 tonnes per year highlights the long-term ambitions of key producing regions.\n• Reality check: Red Rock Resources reports a £4.37M loss despite higher prices, reminding investors that operational efficiency and discipline matter even in a bull market.\n\nCrypto vs Gold\nAs gold holds record levels, crypto investors reassess the “digital gold” thesis.\n• Bitcoin: trades around $89,000, supported by rate-cut expectations but still volatile. Ray Dalio warns that investors may be assigning BTC properties it does not truly have. Peter Schiff continues to predict a major BTC downturn.\n• Allocation debate: Grant Cardone’s public poll on where to put $100,000 (BTC, gold, or silver) captures a broader search for the best hedge in a shifting macro regime.\n• Gold: benefits from the perception of real assets and cash flows. Record issuance of physical ETCs confirms that institutional portfolios still favor gold as the primary long-term insurance asset.\n\nWhat to watch\n• Dollar path and Fed communication around the pace and timing of 2026 rate cuts.\n• Escalation or de-escalation of geopolitical hotspots such as Venezuela.\n• Fresh inflation data from the US and EU and its impact on easing expectations.\n• Ongoing issuance volumes of gold ETCs as a proxy for institutional demand strength.\n\nTakeaways\n• Gold: the uptrend remains in place, but elevated levels demand patience. Pullbacks toward $4,300–4,350 look like zones to scale in for long-term exposure. Goldman’s $4,900 call offers a medium-term reference point rather than a trading target.\n• Miners: still attractive, but selectivity is crucial. Focus on companies with strong balance sheets, low costs, and smart M&A that genuinely creates value rather than just bulk.\n• Crypto: growing skepticism from heavyweight investors and ongoing volatility keep risk high. Over the near term, gold remains the more reliable hedge for capital preservation.\n\nNot financial advice.
