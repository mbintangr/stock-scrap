Super shady AI model movement. This is real don't discredit this until its too late. Here is how it happens posted below..\n\n1. The \"Paper Gold\" Feedback Loop\nInstitutional AI models frequently engage in Derivatives Flooding. For every ounce of physical gold (or PAXG token), there can be up to 100x more \"paper gold\" contracts trading in the market.\n * The Suppression: When the price of PAXG starts to climb, AI models on institutional desks (like JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs) can instantly trigger massive \"sell\" orders in the futures market.\n * The Result: Even if thousands of people are buying physical PAXG, the sheer volume of AI-generated \"paper\" sell orders can overwhelm the price, making it look like demand is low.\n2. Gamma Pinning (Max Pain)\nJust like with Bitcoin, gold-backed crypto options are subject to Gamma Hedging.\n * Market makers (the banks/firms that sell you the options) use AI to stay \"delta neutral.\"\n * If a large number of people buy call options for PAXG at a $4,300 strike price, the AI models will automatically sell the underlying asset as the price approaches that level to hedge their risk.\n * This creates an invisible \"ceiling\" that prevents the price from breaking out, a phenomenon known as Pinning.\n3. Arbitrage against the LBMA\nPAXG and XAUT are pegged to the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) gold price.\n * AI bots constantly monitor the spread between the on-chain price (crypto) and the London spot price (traditional).\n * If organic demand on-chain tries to push PAXG higher than the London price, arbitrage bots will instantly sell PAXG and buy London gold to pocket the difference.\n * This effectively \"shackles\" the crypto version of gold to the highly manipulated traditional gold markets, preventing it from ever \"decoupling\" or having its own organic price run.","gravity_id":"372329015","id":52153,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T10:10:13.999Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T17:50:14.753Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2025-12-27T10:28:45.108Z","text_content":"Tokenized gold + DeFi = Best of both worlds? 🤔\nWith OpenOcean, swap gold-backed tokens seamlessly.\n  \n$XAUT | $PAXG | $XAUM ...\nExplore your options 👉 \nhttp://app.openocean.finance/swap","gravity_id":"372329135","id":52176,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T10:40:13.175Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T17:50:14.626Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2025-12-27T12:28:41.893Z","text_content":"$PAXG   📊 PAXG — crypto_AI_Radar_bot 🔎 Last 3-week scores: [58.2, 58.2, 47.0] ⭐️ Current score: 47.0 / 76 📍 Level: 🟡 Medium  📋 Indicators: – Volume Spike: 0 🟢 RSI: 5 – Trend Structure: 0 🟡 Fibonacci: 4.8 🟢 MACD: 7 🟡 SMA20: 3.2 – OBV: 0 🟢 EMA20: 6 – Crossover: 0 🟡 MA50: 4.0 🟢 ADX: 8 🟢 Ichimoku: 9  💵 Price (ref close): 4493.220000 🎯 Target: 5391.864 🔻 SL: 4268.559 🧷 Source: Binance — Pair: PAXGUSDT","gravity_id":"372327114","id":52346,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T12:30:13.513Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T15:40:49.682Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2025-12-27T13:15:30.423Z","text_content":"RSI Overbought(24h) 1.
