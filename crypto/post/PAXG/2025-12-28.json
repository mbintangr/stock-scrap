We have a clear bullish structure that has been moving inside an upward parallel channel for some time, and price has now broken out to the upside 🟢.  Based on the structure, the next key target lies in the 4727 zone 🎯. The main question is whether price will continue directly from current levels, or first make a healthy pullback to test the FVG around 4420 🚨.","gravity_id":"372358110","id":53955,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T15:00:16.673Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T17:50:13.576Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2025-12-28T14:54:48.564Z","text_content":"PAX Gold : steady value, but crypto winds still matter\n\nPAX Gold moves almost 1:1 with physical gold  and with gold hitting new highs this year,  $PAXG has quietly benefited. The big advantage? It’s one of the few tokenized-gold assets backed by regulated custody and regular audits, which helps build trust with more conservative investors.\n\nThe flip side: competition is heating up. Tether Gold is growing fast and often has deeper liquidity, which can pull traders away during big market moves. And if crypto shifts back into “risk-on” mode, capital could rotate from gold into Bitcoin and altcoins.\n\nBottom line: PAXG is still a solid “digital gold” hedge, especially for users who value regulation and redeemability but its upside will mostly follow the real gold market, not hype cycles.","gravity_id":"372358086","id":53956,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T15:00:16.897Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T17:50:13.803Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2025-12-28T12:41:27.671Z","text_content":"$PAXG  PAXG – PAX Gold: a gold-backed digital token where each unit represents one fine troy ounce of LBMA gold held in vaults, offering crypto access to physical gold with a neutral stance. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\r Live: Price ~ 4568.27 USD • 24h change ~ around flat/slightly mixed • 7d ~ modest variance • Rank ~ mid-40s by market cap • MCap ~ ~1.6B USD • Vol 24h ~ ~100–130M USD (data varies by source). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}\r Trend: Neutral-stable — price largely tracks gold spot movements rather than broad crypto swings; gold price action and macro cues are key. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}\r Levels: Support ~ near gold-equivalent spot price range • Resistance ~ near short-term highs achieved when gold rallies.
