This drop is driven by a broader \"risk-off\" sentiment in the crypto sector (Fear Index: 29), where massive leveraged short positions on BTC and ETH have triggered a liquidity drain, forcing PAXG holders into cash or stablecoins.\n\n​The next major resistance is the $4,479 level (23.6% Fibonacci). With the RSI at a bearish 35.58, the asset is nearing oversold territory, but a failure to reclaim $4,400 could lead to a deeper correction toward the $4,326 demand zone (38.2% Fib).\n\n​If gold holds above its $4,340 support during the New York session, #PAXG  may see a technical bounce. However, until crypto-wide volatility compresses, PAXG will likely continue to trade with a \"crypto-beta\" discount. #Altcoin Season# #Crypto","gravity_id":"372408654","id":56870,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T08:20:26.846Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T17:50:16.491Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2025-12-30T12:58:51.160Z","text_content":"$PAXG /USDT – Consolidating Near All-Time High Resistance (4H & Daily View)  PAXG perpetual is currently trading at $4,416.0 USDT, compressing beneath a major horizontal resistance zone around $4,570–$4,600 after a strong rally aligning with physical gold's record highs.  Price action shows impulsive upside throughout late 2025, forming higher highs and higher lows with momentum slowing into this overhead supply, classic pause behavior in a powerful uptrend, supported by consistent respect of dynamic demand (~$4,300–$4,350).  A confirmed close above $4,570 with expanding volume would signal continuation strength, potentially targeting $4,700–$4,800 extensions. Rejection could lead to mild pullback toward supports. Key Levels:  Resistance zone: $4,570–$4,600 (ATH pivot) Breakout trigger: $4,570 (close above with volume) Upside targets: $4,700–$4,800 Support: dynamic rising (~$4,300–$4,350), deeper (~$4,200)  Traders should monitor volume near resistance before positioning.  PAX Gold (PAXG) remains the premier tokenized gold asset, 1:1 backed by physical London Good Delivery bars in secure vaults with full audits and redemption options. Surging institutional demand for RWAs, geopolitical hedging, and gold's 2025 breakout (up ~70% YTD) drive inflows amid low fees and high liquidity. Watch for broader precious metals momentum or macro catalysts (inflation data, rate outlook) to fuel the next leg. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372413867","id":57264,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T13:00:15.632Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T17:50:16.336Z"}]
