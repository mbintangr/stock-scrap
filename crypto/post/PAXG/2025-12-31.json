Price action remains constructive, with higher lows holding despite repeated resistance tests overhead. Momentum has slowed near the upper boundary, suggesting temporary consolidation rather than distribution. A clean breakout would open the door for continuation toward higher value areas.

On the technical side, price has reclaimed the 30-day SMA and is holding comfortably above the 200-day EMA, suggesting medium-term structure remains bullish despite recent consolidation.   Momentum indicators show balance rather than exhaustion, with RSI hovering near neutral and bearish MACD pressure fading, though upside may be tested by resistance around the $4,430–$4,480 zone.

Systematic USD selling and renewed safe-haven flows push the metal higher, while silver’s breakout confirms broad-based strength across precious metals.\n\nMarket trends\n• Dollar under pressure: CTAs and other systematic funds continue to sell USD, according to BofA, putting sustained pressure on the dollar index. A weaker dollar directly supports gold by making it cheaper for non-USD buyers.\n• Broad metals rally: both gold and silver are printing records, underscoring robust demand for the entire precious-metals complex as an alternative to traditional assets.\n\nTechs\nSupport: around recent breakout zones (just below the new highs) as the market searches for a new equilibrium\nResistance: open-ended at fresh record levels; any pause or pullback is likely to define the next support band\n\nEquities\nEquity markets are quiet into year-end, but precious-metals names still see selective moves and corporate activity.\n• Ratings: UK silver producer Fresnillo receives a rating update from a major investment bank, signaling ongoing reassessment of valuations across the space.\n• M&A: Lions Bay Resources makes an offer for assets of Vantage Goldfields, highlighting continued consolidation and the hunt for quality deposits even in the last trading days of the year.\n\nCrypto vs Gold\nThe long-running “gold vs BTC” debate gets fresh spin from crypto leadership.\n• BTC narrative defense: Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong argues that Bitcoin actually helps the US dollar retain reserve status by acting as “digital gold” that absorbs excess liquidity, rather than undermining it.\n• Comparative pitch: Armstrong also stresses BTC’s divisibility and convenience versus gold, trying to frame it as a complementary savings tool rather than a direct competitor.\n• Recession signal risk: some analysts warn that record highs in gold and silver may also be an early signal of an approaching recession. That could ultimately support both gold and BTC as hedges, but in the near term it reinforces the preference for the more established safe haven: physical gold.\n\nWhat to watch\n• USD (DXY): whether systematic selling persists, continued dollar weakness is the key short-term driver for gold.\n• Year-end bank outlooks: 2026 gold forecasts and macro scenarios from Goldman Sachs, BofA and others will set the agenda for January positioning.\n• Geopolitics: any late-year flare-ups could trigger another leg of safe-haven flows.\n\nTakeaways\n• Gold: the uptrend remains very strong. Dollar weakness is the main immediate catalyst, and any year-end pullback should be viewed as an opportunity to add to strategic positions. Early-2026 objective: holding and building above current record levels.\n• Miners: the sector stays in focus. Look at producers with robust operational performance (like Seligdar) and companies actively involved in smart consolidation.\n• Crypto: BTC’s story is shifting toward “complement to gold” rather than direct rival. Despite new arguments from industry leaders, gold still has the edge as a less volatile, more predictable safe haven into year-end.\n\nNot financial advice.
