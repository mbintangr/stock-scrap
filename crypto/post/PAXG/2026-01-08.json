The short-term chart shows an impulsive downside move, with price now approaching a key demand zone where buyers have stepped in during past corrections.  Immediate support is clustered between $4,300–$4,350. Holding this area is critical for maintaining the longer-term uptrend. A recovery above $4,500 would indicate renewed buyer control and open the path for another test of the $4,600 highs.  Market structure suggests PAXG is in a corrective phase following the parabolic rally. The next sessions will determine whether this pullback evolves into a healthy consolidation or extends into deeper retracement. Professional traders will be watching closely for confirmation signals at both support and resistance levels.  Fundamentally, PAXG tracks physical gold 1:1 with audited reserves, demand remains tied to safe-haven flows, inflation hedging, and RWA adoption in crypto. This correction aligns with spot gold profit-taking, but long-term tailwinds from macro uncertainty support higher prices if support holds. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372671426","id":74031,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T12:30:22.533Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T17:50:21.843Z"}]
