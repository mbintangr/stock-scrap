I am a bitcoiner at heart but silverites just want inflation to get worse. Here is what happened in 1896;\n​Gold Standard vs. Free Silver\n​This was a battle over the money supply and who it should benefit:\n​The Gold Standard: Supported by \"Goldbugs\" (bankers and industrialists). They wanted a fixed money supply to prevent inflation and keep the dollar stable, which favored creditors.\n​Free Silver: Supported by \"Silverites\" (farmers and miners). They wanted the unlimited coinage of silver at a 16:1 ratio to gold. This would increase the money supply, cause inflation, and make it easier for debtors to pay off loans.\nIf Bitcoin were to back the US dollar, we would essentially be returning to a \"Hard Money\" system, very similar to the Gold Standard.\nIn theory, moving to a Bitcoin Standard would be logistically \"easier\" than returning to a physical Gold Standard, but it would be economically much more volatile.\n​Since we are currently in 2026, the discussion around a \"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve\" has moved from fringe internet forums to actual policy debates in Washington.\nLet's go full alpha today Gold bugs and Digital gold bugs folks!

Confirmation signals to watch for: a bullish engulfing candle, a pin bar with a long lower wick, or a lower timeframe trend shift back to bullish. - Entry example: If price dips to 5526–5422 USDT and forms a bullish engulfing candle, enter long there. Set your take profit at 5613.96 USDT and then the 5798.98 USDT area. Place your stop-loss at the recent swing low below your entry, such as below 5390.17 USDT or deeper if targeting lower zones. - If the price fails to hold above 5390.17 USDT and closes below 5266.65 USDT on strong volume, this would invalidate my bullish bias and may signal a deeper retracement toward 5150 or even 5060 USDT.

Price has reached a key overhead supply zone where momentum is beginning to cool. Volatility compression near highs suggests a potential pause or rotation.  A shallow pullback toward rising support would be constructive if buyers defend structure. Failure to hold the trend could trigger a broader corrective move.

The chart highlights key Fibonacci retracement levels that will guide the next directional move.  Key Technical Levels Primary Support: $4,778 — major structural level and the downside reference for trend integrity.  Fibonacci Retracement Levels: 0.382, 0.500, 0.618   These levels define the corrective zone currently being tested.  Upside Objective: A recovery toward the 0.618 extension if buyers regain control.  Market Structure PAXG has maintained a steady upward trajectory over several months. The current pullback aligns with typical corrective behavior inside a strong trend, with price reacting around the Fibonacci cluster.  A sustained hold above $4,778 keeps the broader bullish structure intact and supports the scenario of a continuation toward the higher extension levels. A breakdown below that level would indicate a shift in momentum and invalidate the current trend structure.  📌 Outlook   PAXG is in a controlled retracement phase. If price stabilizes within the Fibonacci zone and buyers step back in, the next move toward the 0.618 extension becomes the primary target. Failure to hold $4,778 would signal a deeper corrective phase.  #PAXG  #Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights#  #Bullish","gravity_id":"373312562","id":109353,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T14:50:18.275Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T17:50:18.959Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2026-01-29T15:29:34.078Z","text_content":"$PAXGwhen crypto hitting it's actually numbers we all be rich like gold and Bitcoin at 730k and gold at 46k when are they hitting the numbers for real","gravity_id":"373314060","id":109456,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T15:30:18.482Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T17:50:18.787Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2026-01-29T15:34:42.224Z","text_content":"$PAXG Today this shiny beautiful thing is in recovery stage getting ready for the next move .
