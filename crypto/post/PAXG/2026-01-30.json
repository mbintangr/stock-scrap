Increasingly, countries are demanding their physical gold back, turning holdings abroad into a counterparty risk. Most gold ETFs only settle in dollars, not in actual metal, making them paper claims rather than true ownership. Normally, this is manageable, but when states start insisting on physical delivery, pressure on the system rises sharply. Dollar weakness and growing sanctions amplify this. The takeaway: in times like these, real gold outside the financial system matters more than any paper claim.","gravity_id":"373342392","id":111387,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T10:00:18.446Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T18:00:20.826Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2026-01-30T11:46:09.220Z","text_content":"$PAXG after all Time high market come back and it will retest the area of $4800 because here is a hug candle which is hidden order block in market\n\n#Gold #ATH","gravity_id":"373344101","id":111631,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T12:00:19.008Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T18:00:20.558Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2026-01-30T13:05:01.565Z","text_content":"$PAXG  It only seems like satire is a toy, but it's so small that it seems like a scary, unnecessary lifeboat.

What’s next on the chart?  From the current structure, $PAXG  is still moving within a controlled retracement — price is reacting around the 0.382–0.618 Fibonacci region, which typically acts as the decision zone inside an uptrend. As long as PAXG holds above the $3,778 structural support, the broader bullish trend remains valid, and the chart still suggests a potential continuation toward the higher extension levels once buyers regain momentum.
