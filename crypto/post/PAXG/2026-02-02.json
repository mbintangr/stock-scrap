Technically, price lost the short-term 7-day SMA and key Fib support, with a bearish MACD confirming momentum cooling, and the move was amplified by leverage unwinding as futures volume spiked and funding flipped negative.   While forced liquidations intensified the pullback, $PAXG  remains well above longer-term trend levels and continues to benefit from physical gold backing, suggesting this looks more like a reset than a trend reversal — the key question now is whether buyers can defend the $4,500 area and turn this dip into a higher-low if broader crypto sentiment stabilizes? ﻿#Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"373433541","id":118176,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T09:40:20.035Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T15:40:25.672Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2026-02-02T08:49:45.130Z","text_content":"Top 3 RWA Assets That May Signal the Direction of the Crypto Market in 2026\nAn analysis of why these three asset categories are leading the market\n\nAs the RWA market begins to mature, it is telling us something important.\nLooking at the RWA market today, it is clear that this is the phase where real capital is starting to decide where it wants to stay.\n\nBased on the latest data from https://t.co/H47KETXq6w, a platform that analyzes statistical data across the digital asset market, the current Top 3 RWA Assets by total value are:\n\n1️⃣ Tether Gold (XAUT)\n2️⃣ Paxos Gold (PAXG)\n3️⃣ BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) \n\nAt first glance, these assets may appear to be very different. But when examined more closely, all three are telling the same story: the market is increasingly searching for sustainability.\n\nRead more👇🏼\nWhen viewed through the lens of asset classes appearing in the Top list, capital is clearly concentrated in three primary categories:\n\n• Gold-backed assets (gold-backed tokens) 🏆\n• U.S. Treasuries, including money market and treasury-backed product structures 💰\n• Private Credit, which continues to hold significant value and remains within the Top 10 ⬆️\n\nWhy are these assets ranked in the Top 3? (Fact-based analysis driven by market behavior)\n1) Gold (XAUT, PAXG) ranked #1 and #2\nGold leads the rankings because it is an asset that markets and investors already understand well, and one that can be tokenized in a straightforward manner.\n\nThe key reasons include:\n• Gold is a widely recognized and globally accepted store of value\n• Its return structure is not complex (there is no need to explain cash-flow models like real estate), making it easy to understand and suitable for long-term holding\n• By nature, investors look to gold for stability rather than aggressive growth\n• In this list, gold-backed tokens are also issued by platforms with strong user bases and high liquidity, allowing the market to adopt them more quickly\n2) U.S. Treasuries / Money Market (BUIDL) ranked #3\nThis category ranks highly because the market is seeking clear returns with low risk onchain.\nThe main reasons these assets consistently remain near the top include:\n\n• U.S. Treasuries serve as a low-risk benchmark in traditional finance\n• They align strongly with the theme of real-world yield, offering a clearer value proposition than early DeFi narratives\n• Products like BUIDL originate from institutional players, enabling faster trust and market acceptance compared to more experimental assets\n• As liquidity and money market fund structures, investors can immediately understand their objective: stability and efficient liquidity management\nKey Insights\nToday’s top-ranked RWA assets reflect a clear signal from investors, markets, and institutions alike: there is strong demand for assets that are easy to understand, structurally sound, and inherently stable.\n\nOther asset classes will follow, but only when infrastructure, compliance, and distribution are truly ready.\n\n#SIXNetwork #RWA #Tokenization","gravity_id":"373432771","id":118177,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T09:40:20.248Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T14:00:22.807Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2026-02-02T08:45:00.742Z","text_content":"$PAXG  Next target 5000$","gravity_id":"373432731","id":118178,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T09:40:20.459Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T13:40:23.425Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2026-02-02T08:33:03.231Z","text_content":"Crazy world rn, #GOLD  dumping -21% in 3 trading days is not normal.   #PAXG  $PAXG","gravity_id":"373433238","id":118179,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T09:40:20.679Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T13:20:23.588Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2026-02-02T08:03:59.785Z","text_content":"$PAXG Bearish!\nTarget 4000","gravity_id":"373431924","id":118180,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T09:40:20.888Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T13:00:23.534Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2026-02-02T08:02:24.088Z","text_content":"$PAXG  — Sellers remain in control Market break it's strong support level  Short PAXG Entry: 4670 SL: 4807 TP: 4512 –  TP2:  4488   Click here and join Trade Immediately👇👇👇👇","gravity_id":"373431904","id":118181,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T09:40:21.100Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T10:40:22.206Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2026-02-02T08:01:42.435Z","text_content":"$PAXG\nYes experts, what's the latest forecast about paxg ?","gravity_id":"373431898","id":118182,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T09:40:21.314Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T10:10:25.423Z"},{"crypto_id":"4705","crypto_name":"PAXG","post_time":"2026-02-02T10:01:26.350Z","text_content":"$PAXG  holding trend support 🟡   After hitting all 3 take-profit targets from our previous post, has pulled back into its daily trendline support.

Right now, PAXG is holding the zone, but there’s no confirmed reversal yet — just slowing momentum.  If buyers step in here, the chart has room for a recovery leg back toward the mid‑range levels. If this zone gives out, the next meaningful support is down near $3,301.  This is one of those spots where the chart is doing exactly what it should after a massive run — cooling off and testing whether the trend has any strength left.  📌 My Take   PAXG is sitting in a key retracement area. Hold this zone → potential recovery. Lose it → deeper correction opens up.
