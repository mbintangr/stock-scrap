Gold sold off while stocks and BTC were bought, signaling a textbook risk-on rotation.\n ・Over the last 24 hours, short liquidations took the lead, with roughly 140M USD in shorts wiped out in just one hour at the peak – a mechanical short squeeze that mirrored, but reversed, the prior long-wipeout move.\n ・Vanguard fully enabled trading of spot crypto ETFs, opening access to BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL ETFs to over 50 million clients. This is effectively the “second act” of the ETF cycle.\n ・BlackRock’s spot BTC ETF (IBIT) surpassed 1.8B USD in trading volume within just two hours of the session open, confirming that both retail and institutional demand via ETFs remain very strong.\n ・At the same time, a fresh 1B USD of USDT was minted, a major positive for liquidity and potential new buying power.\n ・ETH reclaimed the 3,000 USD handle; if it breaks above the upper boundary of the rising wedge, analysts see 3,550–4,000 USD as a possible target zone into year-end / early next year.\n ・As Pelin Ay notes, ETH balances on exchanges – especially Binance – keep trending lower. Supply is tightening on-chain, order books are thin, and even modest demand can move price.\n ・Russia’s move toward easing crypto regulations, the European banking consortium “Qivalis” preparing a euro stablecoin, and TrustWallet rolling out prediction markets all added constructive headlines on the regulation and infrastructure front.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOn-Chain & Technical Trends\n ・BTC’s on-chain “short-term trader cohort” (1–3 month holders) has entered the deepest “pain zone” of this cycle, with a realized price around 113,692 USD and two straight weeks of 20–25% realized losses. This is textbook capitulation behavior.\n ・In past cycles, similar phases have often coincided with bottom formation. After a wave of forced selling from these traders, conditions frequently become attractive for long-term accumulators – assuming the long-term bullish trend remains intact.\n ・Maartunn’s data shows Net Taker Volume (25-hour MA) at +50M USD, the highest since October 2. This signals a transition from derivatives-driven whipsaws toward spot and taker buying leading the move.\n ・CW’s analysis suggests whales are building a sell wall around 98,000 USD. However, once price breaks through this zone, upside resistance thins out significantly, creating a “break and run” structure.\n ・ETH’s exchange supply continues to fall as coins are withdrawn and staked. Several valuation models still flag ETH as “undervalued,” leaving room for an extended upside move if demand persists.\n ・While some analysts highlight a recent slowdown in USDT inflows, the latest large mint points to a renewed improvement in the liquidity backdrop.\n ・MicroStrategy, with 650k BTC plus 1.44B USD in cash, has floated the idea of eventually lending out part of its BTC stack – a potential new revenue leg and an expansion of balance-sheet-driven on-chain demand.\n ・The rapid growth of prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi, plus TrustWallet’s new Predictions feature, adds a fresh layer of on-chain speculation and hedging use-cases, broadening the crypto ecosystem beyond simple spot and leverage.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nSentiment\n ・After extreme fear just a day ago, sentiment flipped quickly as “Fed cut odds at 91%,” “Vanguard all-in,” and “ETF volume explosion” hit the tape together, driving a fast pivot back toward risk-on.\n ・CW is urging: “Don’t doubt the bull market!” and emphasizing that whales kept accumulating BTC during the drawdown. The narrative of “only leveraged players are hurting; large, patient buyers are fine” is gaining traction.\n ・At the same time, Ash Crypto warns that syndicates are actively hunting both longs and shorts, engineering liquidations on both sides. This keeps caution elevated around high leverage and short-term trading.\n ・Kobeissi Letter highlights a sharp drop in US consumer confidence, underscoring a widening “K-shaped” economic divide. Real-world stress is rising even as markets lean into a bullish narrative, widening the gap between macro reality and asset prices.\n ・Bank of America’s view that wealthy clients can consider allocating up to 4% of their portfolios to crypto formalizes digital assets as a “legitimate” asset class in mainstream wealth management.\n ・Trump’s comments that “income tax will disappear” in the near future and that the Fed “should cut next week” add a layer of political noise – fueling both speculative hope and expectations for volatility.\n ・Headlines like “the world’s highest-IQ person declares the bull market has begun” are spreading on social media, mixing FOMO with skepticism – classic late-cycle emotional swings, even if the data still points to room to run.\n ・Overall, the Fear & Greed dynamic is transitioning from “Fear → Neutral → Greed.” More traders are now positioning for a two-stage upside move driven by short squeezes plus ETF-led inflows.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nUS Legacy Markets\n ・For the next Fed meeting, the probability of a rate cut has surged to 91% on Polymarket. Markets are increasingly pricing in a full easing cycle running into 2026.\n ・SEC Chair Paul Atkins stated that regulators are “moving forward in the crypto space” and “seeking to embrace this new innovation,” adding to the positive regulatory momentum alongside the removal of SAB 121 and greater room for banks/brokers to participate.\n ・Bank of America’s “up to 4% allocation” stance for crypto is a milestone for integrating digital assets into classic portfolio theory for HNW clients.\n ・Ford’s ongoing EV sales slowdown and potential scale-back of the F-150 EV line highlight the challenges of an all-EV growth story and may push some capital toward other high-growth themes like AI and crypto.\n ・Big Tech’s escalating AI arms race, with Amazon jumping in more aggressively, continues to drive tech equity valuations and reinforces risk-on sentiment across growth assets.\n ・Trump’s signal that the next Fed Chair nomination will come “early next year” keeps political risk in play, while markets quietly price in a more dovish successor.\n ・In Europe, ten major banks have formed Qivalis to launch a euro-denominated stablecoin, a potential challenge to USD dominance in digital payments and another step in global “currency competition 2.0.”\n ・Net-net, US macro is fragile but markets are leaning into the combination of easing expectations plus secular themes – AI, crypto, and tokenization – as the next engines of growth, boosting both stocks and crypto.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOverall Assessment\nFrom a BoJ-driven shock and derivative-led flush just one day ago, the market has flipped quickly into a risk-on mode powered by three major forces: Vanguard’s full crypto ETF rollout, explosive ETF trading volumes, and a 91% implied probability of a Fed rate cut. Volatility remains high due to short squeezes and news-driven spikes, but ETF demand, USDT liquidity, and short-term trader capitulation collectively resemble classic bottom-zone conditions.\nToday’s XWIN TREND INDEX is 72 / 100, with a “Mild Uptrend” bias.\nIn the short term, price action is still dominated by squeezes and headlines, so intraday swings can be violent. However, Vanguard’s entry and the re-acceleration of ETF flows look like structural demand, not just a one-off catalyst. The stance we favor is low leverage and spot-heavy positioning, closely tracking ETF flows, on-chain metrics, and USDT issuance, while aiming to ride a potential “full return” to a sustained uptrend rather than chasing every intraday spike.","gravity_id":"371567042","id":685,"createdAt":"2025-12-02T23:00:02.616Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-03T00:10:07.578Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-02T22:57:02.386Z","text_content":"Prediction markets are scaling on Polygon 🔮  \r \r With deeper liquidity, fast settlement, and consistently low-cost execution, Polygon has become the preferred environment for high-volume, real-time prediction platforms.  \r \r $SOL  prediction markets continue to grow, but sustained performance under load remains essential for markets that rely on responsiveness, liquidity density, and accurate pricing ⚡  \r \r Polygon provides the infrastructure required for these platforms to operate reliably at scale, supporting the continued expansion of onchain market dynamics.  \r \r #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"371567031","id":702,"createdAt":"2025-12-02T23:00:07.919Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-03T00:10:07.611Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-02T23:19:45.841Z","text_content":"$SOL I love Solana and I'm loading my bags, however, until a break above 150 I'm holding off on any long positions, I think we're gonna see sub 120 again before any significant upward momentum back into the 200 range.

Kalshi’s onchain expansion is backed by serious firepower: the platform has previously raised $1B at an $11B valuation, with investors like Sequoia, a16z, Paradigm, and others.  📈 Prediction markets are booming — with trading volumes nearing $28B by late 2025.
