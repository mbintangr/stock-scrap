The team voided the sale, analysts traced the attack to a Sybil cluster, and retail buyers were left frustrated but the incident highlights a bigger problem across Web3.  Top builders, traders, and researchers agree: open, instant token launches are increasingly impossible to keep fair. Fast chains and near-zero fees make automated sniping trivial, and commercial bot tools give even small players an edge over humans.  The community is now pushing for alternatives, commit–reveal sales, randomized lotteries, community whitelists, identity gating, and slower auction formats. All improve fairness, but each adds friction or reduces decentralization.  The takeaway: in 2025, fair launches don’t happen by accident. Without deliberate design, bots will dominate every time.

The second the contract goes live, it’s not humans competing, it’s bots with faster execution, deeper code, and zero emotions. As a trader watching this space daily, you already know: unless a team builds anti-bot layers, whitelists, or phased releases, the fair launch idea dies the moment MEV bots smell profit. And on $SOL  , where transactions clear in milliseconds, humans don’t stand a chance.  So are fair token launches even possible? Yes, but only if teams accept that fairness requires friction, rate limits, pre-verified wallets, or lottery-style allocations. Without that, every hyped presale becomes a speed race the average trader is destined to lose.    WET wasn’t an exception, it was just another reminder that in crypto, fairness isn’t natural, it has to be engineered. ﻿#Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights# ﻿ #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"371680853","id":7510,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T04:40:15.075Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T05:00:19.665Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-06T04:43:45.062Z","text_content":"Solana Prepares for Next Leg Up With $186 as the Key Level to Break🚀🔥\n\nTo Know More👇\nhttps://thenewscrypto.com/solana-prepares-for-next-leg-up-with-186-as-the-key-level-to-break/\n\n#Solana #SOL","gravity_id":"371680933","id":7522,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T04:50:12.823Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T05:10:14.630Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-06T04:59:21.471Z","text_content":"$SOL dips, traders load up… or run away?\nWhich one are you today?\"\n#Altcoin Season# #solana","gravity_id":"371682044","id":7532,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T05:00:19.413Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T05:50:12.990Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-06T04:51:03.016Z","text_content":"The Solana $SOL  WET presale getting sniped by bots is another reminder of how tough fair launches have become.

The developers emphasize that SKR is designed not for storage, but for active use by ordinary Seeker owners and creators of decentralized applications.\r To ensure this, the company plans to use a direct distribution model. Bypassing complicated startup procedures or external funding rounds, SKR will go directly into the hands of the community. A significant portion of the initial offering - 30% of the 10 billion tokens - is set aside for distribution and staged discovery, targeting groups already involved in Solana Mobile.\r The announcement was also accompanied by a humorous comment from Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, who, reposting the news, noted that it only takes 10 years to build an ecosystem.\r His remark emphasizes the unconventional path of Solana in the mobile segment. The #web3  experiment has evolved into a global product lineup with a loyal audience.\r The growing community around the Solana Seeker smartphone was one of the main factors that gave impetus to the launch of SKR.\r https://transscreen.ru/en/news27529","gravity_id":"371610968","id":8133,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T11:30:13.390Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T12:10:17.378Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-04T07:58:25.242Z","text_content":"Solana Breaks Trendline as Bulls Target $155  🔹 $SOL  clears descending resistance on 4H chart, pushing toward 200-day EMA at $149 with aligned EMA cluster ($135-$149) forming upward channel.  🔹 Parabolic SAR flips bullish for first time since November.
