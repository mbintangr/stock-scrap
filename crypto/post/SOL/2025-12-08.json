The failure to reclaim the 100-hour SMA keeps $SOL  trading under key Fibonacci levels, where RSI near 41 suggests lingering downside pressure even as MACD hints at early bullish divergence. Broader sentiment has also been weighed down by DeFi uncertainty following Kamino’s block on Jupiter’s migration tool, alongside post-Upbit hack jitters that briefly shook confidence in SOL-denominated liquidity.   While staking yields and institutional inflows offer some downside support, a sustained move below $132 could open the door to a $124–$125 retest, making the next few sessions critical — can $SOL  regain $135 and shift momentum back in bulls’ favor? ﻿#Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"371731594","id":11382,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T01:50:13.395Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T03:20:14.260Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-08T02:08:48.566Z","text_content":"Solana -“Big Week”\n\n\nSolana official page just tweeted it’s gonna be a Big Week!

This year and cycle has mostly consisted of smaller several month mini cycles where $BTC  and a select few alts outperform. Only to go in a slow and corrective phase afterwards.  This makes it so this cycle is nothing like the previous ones, where the market could just trend for 6-12 months non stop. This has made it very hard on the crypto natives that tend to go risk on after a big move or breakout happened. But in this cycle that got punished hard.  I personally think 2026 will be more of the same. The crypto market is more and more intertwined with macro and TradFi and that's what were seeing with this price action.

This is not typical ETF behavior, especially during a period of strong macro tailwinds and increasing institutional attention.  Meanwhile, Bitwise (BSOL) and Grayscale (GSOL) show steady inflows, contributing to a total +638M across all SOL ETFs.  🔹 What’s unusual?  In a normal ETF launch:  Seed capital is created to provide initial liquidity.  After that, AUM should grow with new inflows, not be drained close to zero.  Heavy outflows so early usually mean:  Authorized participants arbitraging NAV vs spot,  Liquidity rotation into a cheaper ETF,  Internal rebalancing,  Or simply data inconsistencies (which has happened before).  Yet the other SOL issuers aren’t showing the same pattern — which makes TSOL stand out even more.  🔹 Market Context  Bitcoin ETFs see mixed flows, Ethereum ETFs show heavy rotation, but Solana remains one of the few with net positive inflows.  Macro tailwinds (rate cuts priced in, QE returning, banks adopting crypto rails) support risk-on assets — making the TSOL pattern even more curious.  ❓ Open Question  Why is 21Shares' Solana ETF almost fully unwinding its seed position while competitors are accumulating?

Normal people using regular wallets and swapping through Jupiter or directly on the site simply can’t compete. By the time your transaction goes through, the price is already pumped 10-100x and 70-90% of the tokens are already in bot wallets.  \n\nThese bots run on private nodes, pay massive priority fees, and sometimes even bundle their buys with the liquidity addition itself, so they’re guaranteed to get in first. Devs and their inner circle usually get the real dip too, either through presale or by running the same bots.  \n\nSo unless you’re coding your own sniper, paying for bundle services, or you’re friends with the team, “fair launch” on Solana in 2025 is honestly just a myth for retail traders.

Mantle liquidity. Now connected to BTCFi.  Solana sets the pace for high-throughput trading, while $MNT  is becoming a liquidity venue for Ethereum-native DeFi. Users on both sides are moving size all day; the real question is how easily can that capital reach new opportunities?  That is where Hemi’s LI.FI integration fits in.  With LI.FI plugged into Hemi, a swap from Solana or Mantle into Hemi feels like a single decision instead of a multi-step chore. Users can route assets from the ecosystems they already trade in and land directly inside Hemi’s BTCFi layer, without juggling multiple apps or manual hops.  Once funds arrive on Hemi, they can rotate into BTC-backed yield, liquidity provision, or DeFi strategies that treat Bitcoin as a programmable asset. For builders, LI.FI gives a standard way for users to enter from many chains, while Hemi focuses on turning that flow into Bitcoin-native activity.  Multichain access is getting smoother. Hemi makes sure Bitcoin is part of that story.  #Altcoin Season#  #DeFi","gravity_id":"371749436","id":12935,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T16:30:21.743Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T16:50:20.233Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-08T16:28:45.041Z","text_content":"Crypto market today is behaving like your friend after a promotion – confident, but still checking bank balance every 10 minutes.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is holding near $91,100 (~₹82.4L), up around 1.5–2% in 24 hours as traders bet on a friendlier Fed.​\n\nEthereum (ETH) is around $3,130 (~₹2.82L), gaining about 3% in a day and nearly 11% in a week, quietly leading large‑caps.​\n\nXRP & SOL are in mild green, tagging along with the BTC‑ETH mood rather than writing their own script today.​\n\nVibe check: fear has cooled off, but nobody is fully trusting the rally till BTC clears the $92K–93K zone.​\n\nFor Indian traders who want less drama and more discipline, read the charts on Cofinex, not random screenshots.\nWatch live prices & execute fast 👉 https://t.co/raGGw4Ykw6\nJoin the evening market gossip 👉 https://t.co/H0mHSkel2x","gravity_id":"371752074","id":12939,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T16:40:06.303Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T17:10:24.040Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-08T16:38:00.059Z","text_content":"$SOL Currently consolidating in a tight weekly range after a sharp post-peak correction from $290.\n\nAs long as $120 holds as support, the setup strongly favours an explosive move toward $220–$250, resuming the broader uptrend and potentially retesting all-time highs by mid-2026.\n\nThis classic re-accumulation pattern, combined with fading sell-pressure, points to the next major leg higher once breakout occurs and $194 flips into support.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights# #Altcoin Season# #Meme Alpha#","gravity_id":"371752136","id":12956,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T16:40:22.631Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T17:20:25.322Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-08T16:31:05.724Z","text_content":"$SOL Solanus is shitty","gravity_id":"371750476","id":12957,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T16:40:22.767Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T17:10:23.929Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-08T16:42:19.590Z","text_content":"Most people are so caught up in market trends that they’re overlooking major opportunities, like the Bitget Trading Club Championship Phase 20, which just launched and offers a large pool of BGB rewards for the highest-volume traders.\n\n\nIn this round, trades involving $XRP $SOL BTC, and ETH all qualify, making the event even more appealing.\n\n\nIt’s a worthwhile chance to participate, especially since RHEA offers the lowest entry barrier and makes it easiest to earn 50 BGB in rewards.\n#Altcoin Season# #Meme Alpha# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371751326","id":12972,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T16:50:07.095Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T17:20:25.219Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-08T17:07:37.317Z","text_content":"Bitcoin surpassed $91,000.
