At the same time, short-term flash volatility risk around the event remains high.\n────────────────────\nMarket Summary\n・BTC has pulled back toward the CME gap while still sitting in a range with thick liquidity both above and below. Once it breaks either side, the move is likely to be large.\n・Kalshi markets now place the probability of a December Fed rate cut at 94%. The cut itself is mostly priced in; the key is to separate “the violent moves right after the announcement” from “the trend over the following weeks.”\n・Recent ETF flows show: modest net inflows into BTC, clear net outflows from ETH, and strong inflows into SOL. Capital is tilting toward “BTC for safety + SOL for high beta,” while ETH temporarily sits in a cleanup phase.\n・Open Interest continues a classic “rinse and repeat”: spikes higher, then gets wiped out. In this derivatives-driven market, price swings are noisy and do not always reflect underlying supply–demand.\n・Binance user numbers have finally passed 300 million, as CZ confirmed on X. Even in a bearish environment, trading infrastructure and the user base keep expanding—crypto is still in the “adoption phase,” not the endgame.\n・In the Middle East, Tether USD₮ has been approved in Abu Dhabi’s ADGM, and Dubai Customs has partnered with Binance to introduce crypto payments for trade and logistics. The region is strengthening its role as a real-world demand driver for stablecoins and crypto settlement.\n・Argentina will allow banks to offer crypto services from 2026. High-inflation countries are increasingly connecting banking and crypto at the national level.\n・BlackRock has filed for a staking-enabled ETH ETF. If institutional money flows in through a “yield-bearing ETH ETF” wrapper, the structural impact on ETH demand could be significant.\n────────────────────\nOn-chain & Technical Trends\n・BTC balances on exchanges continue to decline as coins move to long-term wallets. The main source of selling pressure is shrinking, a medium-term positive from a supply perspective.\n・In futures, Open Interest has dropped to near year-to-date lows and leverage has rapidly normalized. Speculative froth has been burned off, leaving a “light order book” that can move sharply on new positive catalysts.\n・BTC taker buy volume has surged over the past two weeks. Dips are being aggressively bought, whales may be absorbing sell pressure, and short covering is adding fuel—together supporting short-term upside momentum.\n・BTC/Gold 2-week RSI has fallen to the same depressed levels seen in 2014 and 2022. In both prior cases, these levels coincided with cycle bottoms, so the market is starting to price in a similar “relative bottom” scenario again.\n・Bitfinex whales have kept their BTC longs largely unchanged, with only tiny short exposure. This implies they are not particularly interested in betting on downside, while still waiting for the right moment to realize profits on the long side.\n・For ETH, around $2,800 there is a roughly $2.5B “fortress support” zone built by institutions and whales. Long-term holder realized price is almost identical to this level, making $2,800 an economically meaningful line that deep, sustained selling would have to overcome.\n・ETH ETFs saw a historic capitulation in November, with about $1.4B in net outflows. That flush looks like the final chapter of a leveraged, ETF-driven bubble. A reversal in flows from here would be a strong signal of a new medium-term trend.\n・ETH transaction counts and active addresses have started to rise clearly for the first time since entering the corrective phase. Meanwhile, daily fee revenue (90-day SMA) has dropped to the lowest level since 2017, showing both “weak current demand” and “massive room for mean reversion,” especially as post-Fusaka on-chain activity remains strong.\n────────────────────\nSentiment\n・Overall, sentiment is still closer to “Fear,” but more people are talking about classic BTC bottoming patterns after capitulation and the possibility of a “Santa Rally.” The market is slowly shifting from extreme fear toward “cautious optimism.”\n・According to Crypto Rover, institutional BTC buying has fallen to one of the lowest levels of this cycle. Historically, such “demand troughs” have often been followed by major reversals, so participants are watching closely for a turn in flows.\n・Darkfost’s data shows that retail BTC inflows to Binance have fallen over 60% since the FTX collapse, with ETF channels now absorbing more retail demand. On-chain, “retail presence” is fading, typical of a quiet consolidation phase.\n・Bloomberg’s quant research suggests that the 2025 BTC decline was driven more by crypto-specific factors—particularly unusual selling from long-term holders—than by macro weakness. This strengthens the view that macro conditions remain structurally supportive for BTC.\n・Analysts like Ash Crypto and Glassnode highlight that BTC looks oversold relative to gold, while ETH fees are at multi-year lows. Both point to large upside potential once demand returns. Bernstein even argues that the traditional four-year BTC cycle is over and that BTC is ultimately headed toward $1M in a new structural regime.\n・On the other hand, US hiring plans and manufacturing employment have deteriorated to near-crisis levels, and ISM manufacturing employment remains deep in contraction. The creeping weakness in the real economy is a growing risk-off factor.\n・Mister Crypto notes that BTC now sits at an oversold zone where a stronger rebound could easily begin, and a seasonal “Santa Rally” would not be surprising. Among short-term traders, the bias is shifting from “shorting the dip” to “waiting to buy the reversal.”\n・Overall, many participants are tired of the constant leverage flushes and are converging on a cautious consensus: instead of “trying to predict every move,” keep positions light and wait patiently for asymmetric opportunities.\n────────────────────\nUS Legacy Markets\n・This week is a “super week” with the FOMC rate decision, Powell’s press conference, and key labor data. Standard Chartered and Citi expect a 25bp cut this week plus additional cuts into 2026, but markets are already assuming “no aggressive easing cycle,” just a gradual path.\n・The Fed has already ended QT, and discussions are turning toward “Reserve Management Purchases”—a more subtle form of liquidity provision that would function as a light version of QE. A turn in dollar liquidity would be a medium-term tailwind for crypto.\n・US gasoline prices have fallen to $2.95 per gallon, a four-year low. This supports consumer sentiment and helps push inflation lower, expanding the Fed’s room for rate cuts.\n・At the same time, corporate hiring plans are the weakest since 2010, manufacturing jobs are shrinking more frequently, and the ISM manufacturing employment index is deeply contractionary. If this continues, recession fears will grow stronger.\n・The tug-of-war between AI and geopolitics continues, with the US expected to allow Nvidia’s H200 exports to China—a major policy shift that will impact supply chains and tech valuations. PMI, a key business cycle indicator, has shown surprisingly high correlation with “altseason” indices, highlighting the linkage between macro cycles and crypto.\n・CEOs from Citi, BofA, and Wells Fargo are scheduled to brief US senators on the “crypto market structure” bill. This marks a new phase where top-tier TradFi leadership is directly involved in designing crypto regulation.\n・Alongside US debates, regulators worldwide are accelerating work on stablecoin and on-chain frameworks. The EU’s MiCA example is fueling expectations that “clear rules = growth driver,” not necessarily a brake on the market.\n・BTC is currently trading near the average cost basis of spot ETF holders. Whether this level holds will be a key test of institutional confidence in the asset over the short term.\n────────────────────\nOverall Assessment\nThe market has moved into a state where “the foundation is quite healthy, but short-term flash volatility can erupt at any time.” OI has dropped, leverage has been cleaned out, and Derivatives risk is much lower. At the same time, ETH’s $2,800 fortress support, classic BTC post-capitulation patterns, and the sense that ETF and institutional deleveraging is largely complete all point to a medium-term strengthening of fundamentals and supply–demand.\nToday’s XWIN TREND INDEX is 74 / 100, with a directional bias of “Mild uptrend.”\nLooking one month ahead, this FOMC has the potential to be a turning point for the trio of “rates, dollar, and liquidity.” As seen in the last two rate-cut episodes, the pattern of “initial spike after the announcement, followed by a different trend in the weeks after” could repeat. That is why, once again, “preparing” is more important than “predicting.” The priority now is to keep leverage minimal, gradually accumulate spot BTC, ETH, and select L1s (such as SOL), and continuously track ETF flows, OI, and key on-chain signals (especially ETH activity and BTC whale behavior). A stance of “constructively bullish, but with position sizing and event-volatility risk management as the top priority” is appropriate for this phase.","gravity_id":"371759590","id":13625,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T23:20:06.081Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T00:50:34.240Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-08T23:19:45.038Z","text_content":"BAM is NOT a centralized sequencer.\n\nIt's a 𝗱𝗲𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 designed to prevent monopolistic control over transaction ordering on Solana! 💥\n\nThe latest 𝗕𝗔𝗠 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 explores more.\n\nNow LIVE on the Jito YouTube channel!\n\n🔗📺️⬇️ \n2/3 Series was created in tandem with the \"Realities, Myths, and Misconceptions of BAM\" article on the BAM blog!\n\nThe 1st episode in the series counters the argument that \"BAM is a centralized sequencer with a block-building monopoly.\"\nhttps://bam.dev/blog/realities-myths-and-misconceptions-of-bam-a-steelman-exploration/\n3/3 🛡️ Watch the full episode \"BAM Series 1: The Centralization Critique\" on the Jito YouTube channel! \n\n🔗📺️⬇️ \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCcnK_Su4fM","gravity_id":"371760513","id":13636,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T23:20:30.804Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T01:20:48.968Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-08T23:10:45.077Z","text_content":"NEW: @base DEX @AerodromeFi CLAIMS THAT IT IS DELIVERING OPTIMAL EXECUTION FOR $SOL TRADES, \"AT TIMES EVEN BETTER THAN ON @solana ITSELF\" - DISSES @JupiterExchange ","gravity_id":"371760440","id":13637,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T23:20:31.103Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T00:20:43.422Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-08T23:30:29.845Z","text_content":"$SOL  dumping for 12 hours straight...

Structure-wise, bears still have control — lower highs, lower lows, no ambiguity there. The recent bounce stalled exactly near channel resistance around 144–145, which tells you sellers are defending that level aggressively.  Right now price is hovering near 132, sitting in the middle-to-lower part of the channel. That’s a danger zone for bulls:  Below ~128–125, the probability increases for a revisit of the channel low near 118–112.  Above 145 (daily close) would be the first real sign of strength and could open the door for 155–165, but that breakout hasn’t happened yet.  Momentum looks weak but stabilizing, not collapsing — more like consolidation before the next directional move.  Bottom line: As long as $SOL  stays below 145, this is still a sell-the-rally / range-play market, not a trend reversal. Bulls need a clean breakout; bears are winning on structure, not speed.  #Macro Insights#  #Solana","gravity_id":"371774945","id":14824,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T12:10:17.633Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T13:00:24.526Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-09T12:16:20.644Z","text_content":"🔥 UPDATE: Solana continues to lead all L1 and L2 networks in 24-hour DApp revenue and DEX trading volume\n\n#DEX #SOL #Solana  $SOL","gravity_id":"371775133","id":14843,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T12:20:16.458Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T13:10:18.059Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-09T12:22:45.071Z","text_content":"#BinanceBlockchainWeek wrap-up.\n\nMet some killer teams pushing RWAs, infra, wallets, and stablecoin rails forward.\n\n@BinanceWallet @TrustWallet @solayer_labs @solana @plumenetwork @MANTRA_Chain @circle @pixels_online @QuillAudits_AI @celo @trondao @BNBCHAIN @Stake_Stone + more \nSolid conversations across the board.\n\nNext step: turn those chats into integrations that actually ship. 🚀","gravity_id":"371775176","id":14856,"createdAt":"2025-12-09T12:30:18.799Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T13:20:19.664Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-09T12:37:45.073Z","text_content":"XRP ETF Outperforms BTC, SOL, ETH, but XRP Price in a Make-Or-Break Situation\nSpot XRP ETFs saw $38M inflows, outperforming BTC, ETH, and SOL.
