When big players rebalance, they create micro-gaps across ecosystems. TON-based trading venues have started absorbing part of this volatility, especially when Solana congestion appears during high-volume hours.  That’s why STONfi sees sudden surges in routing activity during SOL volatility events. Traders use TON liquidity pools to reposition faster, then re-enter SOL plays once spreads tighten.
