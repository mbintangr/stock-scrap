Following the FOMC, it dropped about $5,000 in 20 hours. While the Nasdaq is just −2% off its ATH, BTC sits −28% below its peak, revealing an “asymmetrically weak” setup.\n ・ETH is testing a key resistance zone around $3,300–3,400. Price action is strong, but large ETH inflows to Binance combined with stablecoin outflows create a flow profile that looks more like “sell / distribute” than sustainable accumulation.\n ・According to glassnode, unrealized losses have expanded to roughly $350B across the crypto market, including about $85B from BTC alone. With so many underwater positions, relatively small negative catalysts can still trigger sharp waves of forced selling.\n ・Stablecoin inflows to exchanges (ERC-20, 7-day average) have halved from $158B in August to $76B now. New money is clearly slowing, which means less fresh buying power to absorb sell pressure or chase breakouts.\n ・At the same time, BTC, ETH, and SOL spot ETFs are all seeing continued inflows. Over the past two weeks, crypto ETFs have attracted a combined $1.8B, and total AUM has recovered +7.9% from the November bottom. Institutional capital is quietly returning.\n ・Silver has hit a new all-time high at $63.59/oz. Flows into precious metals are strengthening on the back of inflation-hedge and safety demand, while crypto sits more at the “outer ring” of the risk-on spectrum waiting to catch up.\n ・On the adoption side, Russia’s central bank signaling readiness to integrate crypto, BoA’s BTC-backed credit product, and U.S. Congress pushing for BTC in 401(k)s are all structurally bullish developments.\n ・CZ’s comments about a potential “supercycle” in 2026 underline the strong long-term narrative, but in the near term, December has slipped back into the red, leaving short-term traders facing a difficult and choppy market.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOn-chain & technical trends\n ・BTC’s Exchange Inflow CDD (Binance) has dropped to 380, the lowest since 2017. This shows that almost all coins moving to exchanges are “young coins,” while long-term holders (old coins) are barely moving any supply. Smart money is not selling at current levels.\n ・At the same time, glassnode highlights a broad contraction in market liquidity. Both bids and asks are thin, meaning even small orders can cause outsized price swings: a classic setup for a “high-volatility phase.”\n ・ETH’s estimated leverage ratio has surged to 0.579, the highest in history. With price pushing higher alongside a vertical jump in leverage, the rally looks more “leverage-driven” than “spot-driven,” raising the risk of liquidation cascades in either direction.\n ・On Binance, roughly $1.6B worth of ETH has flowed in over the past 7 days, while USDT and USDC have seen a combined outflow of about $2.3B. More supply, less buying power – a textbook bearish divergence that makes any breakout attempt vulnerable to bull traps and sharp rejections.\n ・ETH’s 30-day Net Taker Volume is forming higher lows. Selling pressure still exists, but the intensity of aggressive selling is fading. The pattern looks very similar to early 2025, when Net Taker Volume turned positive in April and ETH went on to rally more than 3x.\n ・New BTC whales have been capitulating, with about $386M in realized losses yesterday alone. Short-term players are being flushed out, while older whales remain largely inactive – a classic “rotation” from weak hands to stronger hands.\n ・The memecoin market has effectively gone into full standstill. Both liquidity and hype have evaporated, signaling that speculative hot money has largely left the arena for now.\n ・On spot markets, BTC has seen a shift toward “market buys” becoming dominant. The increase in aggressive spot buying suggests early signs that short-term demand is slowly returning as panic selling fades.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nSentiment\n ・The Fear & Greed Index stands at 28 (“Fear”), a clear improvement from last month’s “Extreme Fear,” but still far from outright optimism. Pessimism is fading, yet conviction is not back.\n ・Analysts like Crypto Rover note that retail participation is “close to zero.” The current market is moving in an eerie silence, driven mostly by institutions and whales while short-term individual traders are almost completely sidelined.\n ・Data from The Kobeissi Letter and ETF flows show a clear sentiment shift: short BTC ETPs are seeing heavy outflows while spot crypto ETFs receive steady inflows – a sign that market positioning is gradually turning more constructive.\n ・At the same time, the combination of large unrealized losses, record-high ETH leverage, and shrinking stablecoin inflows means the market remains fragile. It would not take much to spark another wave of panic selling.\n ・President Trump’s comment that “Bitcoin and crypto are a very important industry to invest in” and potential tax relief on gambling winnings add to the perception that U.S. policy is structurally moving in a more crypto-friendly direction.\n ・In the nonprofit space, Save the Children’s new Bitcoin Fund highlights how crypto is being woven into real-world charity and aid delivery, gradually reinforcing its legitimacy and social utility.\n ・Media and entertainment stories like Netflix’s upcoming crypto-comedy film increase cultural exposure. While they don’t move price in the short term, they do help shape long-term adoption narratives.\n ・Overall, sentiment can be described as “cautious optimism mixed with fatigue”: investors don’t want to sell the bottom, but they’re still reluctant to go all-in on the next leg up.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nU.S. traditional markets\n ・The Fed has cut rates by a cumulative 0.75% over the past three months. Structurally, this is supportive of risk assets, including crypto, but each decision has followed a similar pattern: “buy the rumor, sell the news,” with post-FOMC corrections becoming the norm.\n ・Most recently, BTC dropped sharply after the FOMC while the Nasdaq remained only 2% off its ATH, underscoring a “crypto-specific shock” rather than a broad risk-off move.\n ・The U.S. trade deficit has fallen to its lowest level since 2020. The resilience of the U.S. economy and the dollar keeps global investors comfortable staying in U.S. risk assets.\n ・The OCC has allowed banks to engage in “riskless principal” crypto transactions, opening the door for major U.S. banks to act as front-end intermediaries for digital assets.\n ・JPMorgan has executed a commercial paper issuance for Galaxy Digital on Solana, with payments and redemptions settled in USDC. This is a tangible example of public blockchains being used in real-world TradFi transactions.\n ・At the same time, an OCC report has highlighted “de-banking” of certain industries (fossil fuels, firearms, crypto) by some large banks, showing that regulatory and ESG pressures still tug in the opposite direction.\n ・In Congress, bills like the Clarity Act are progressing, with 2026 likely to be pivotal for establishing clearer crypto rules. Regulatory uncertainty remains a short-term overhang, but long-term it could lower barriers to institutional adoption.\n ・Gold and silver continue to be repriced as core safe-haven assets, while BTC and ETH are seen more as high-beta “digital gold options” that respond strongly to changes in global risk appetite.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOverall assessment\nThe current market structure can be summed up as: long-term holders are not selling, ETFs and institutions are quietly buying, retail and new liquidity are drying up, and leverage – especially in ETH – is hitting extremes. On the structural side, this is bullish: BTC LTH CDD at cycle lows, steady ETH accumulation by DATs, ETF inflows, and adoption via 401(k)s, banks, and real-world debt issuance all support a constructive 12–24 month view.\nAt the same time, record-high ETH leverage, shrinking stablecoin inflows, and roughly $350B in unrealized losses mean the market is one strong shock away from another spike in volatility. Today’s XWIN TREND INDEX is 64 / 100, with a directional bias of “Mild uptrend.”\nLooking one month ahead, the most rational stance is a “cautiously bullish, risk-managed” posture: accumulate mainly via spot, keep leverage very limited, watch ETF and stablecoin inflows as confirmation signals, and be prepared to scale in gradually on sharp downside volatility rather than chasing every short-term bounce.","gravity_id":"371854649","id":20400,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T20:10:02.217Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T21:00:19.503Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-11T20:08:26.019Z","text_content":"‎#SocialMining\n‎\n‎I found Stanton Terranova (CEO of XPOLL) while researching tools that study social signals.

So both long and short traders have an opportunity depending on how the retest behaves in the next candles.\nShort Outlook:\nA break below 138.50 will open downside liquidity and may drag SOL back toward 137.20 for a proper reset.\nTargets:\n\t•\tTP1: 141.00\n\t•\tTP2: 143.20\nStop Loss:\n\t•\tSL: 138.40\n#SOL #Solana #CryptoAnalysis","gravity_id":"371867497","id":21233,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T06:30:24.329Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T06:50:19.282Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-12T06:25:36.731Z","text_content":"$SOL leads 24h DEX volume rankings with $4.048B, followed by Ethereum at $1.916B and BSC at $1.781B.\n#SOL","gravity_id":"371867484","id":21234,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T06:30:24.460Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T06:50:19.414Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-12T06:21:43.059Z","text_content":"BUY ALERT ‼️\n\n\n$SOL is having a strong resistance at 143$ and now its trading near the resistance as bitcoin is moving solana will breakout the resistance and start pumping 👀 get in before it explodes 🚀\n#Solana","gravity_id":"371867439","id":21235,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T06:30:24.590Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T06:50:19.541Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-12T06:34:45.040Z","text_content":"Catch Drift co-founder @cindyleowtt at Solana Breakpoint today!\n\nFresh alpha, building the perp DEX of the future, and what’s ahead in 2026.\n\n12:30 PM Local Time | Absolute Cinema Stage ","gravity_id":"371867559","id":21243,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T06:40:18.959Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T07:00:26.225Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-12T06:34:09.177Z","text_content":"$SOL  I want to inform and congratulate all my followers who participated in the #solana   trade.

Solana aims to capture 25% of the on-chain market share in the next decade, positioning itself for long-term dominance. 🌐  🔑 Developer Power and Growing Adoption: Gokal praised Solana's strong developer base and expanding ecosystem. Over 1,700 teams participated in Solana’s ‘Colosseum’ hackathons, showcasing the platform’s thriving innovation hub. With more decentralized apps (dApps) generating revenue, Solana's ecosystem is set for substantial growth. 💡  📉 Current Market Challenges and Momentum: Despite a 42.64% price drop over the past 90 days, Solana remains strong, with a market cap of $78.17B and active community participation. Analysts believe the platform’s high throughput and adoption rates will help it weather fluctuations and position itself as a leader in blockchain innovation. 🌍  🗣️ Regulatory Clarity is Key: Gokal highlighted the importance of regulatory clarity for further growth. Solana's trajectory will largely depend on adapting to regulatory changes while maintaining developer and investor confidence. 🔮  🔮 Takeaway: Solana’s future is bright, with significant growth potential in the years to come.

Plus, the rise of tokenization, new prediction market rails, and whether this week marks the first real cycle turn for Ethereum.\n\n[TIMESTAMPS]\n\n0:00 Intro\n\n5:01 Markets\n- @EricBalchunas\n- @RyanWatkins_\n- @MikeIppolito_\n- @jameslavish\n- @KobeissiLetter\n- @JustDeauIt\n\n24:52 @farcaster_xyz is pivoting to a wallet\n- @DefiIgnas\n- @eth_call\n- @nic_carter\n- @TrustlessState \n- @dwr\n\n37:11 ZK … early stage of unleashing Ethereum’s vision\n- @zksync\n- @StaniKulechov\n- @Celo\n\n47:06 Did @base launch a vampire attack on Solana’s liquidity?\n- @jessepollak\n- @vibhu\n- @0xyoussea\n- @solana\n\n52:30 Ethereum's first Blob Parameter Only (BPO) fork is now live on the network\n\n56:17 Regulators are doing a complete 180\n- @OndoFinance\n- @coinbureau\n- @joechalom\n- @WatcherGuru\n- @USComptroller\n\n1:05:03 The New York Times put out an anti-stablecoin explainer piece\n- @0xDeployer\n- @nic_carter\n\n1:06:50 Gemini can now offer prediction markets in the US - Stock Surges Nearly 14%\n- @gemini\n- @gondorfi\n\n1:07:49 Meme of the Week\n\n1:09:36 Closing & Disclaimers\nListen ad-free here👇\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/356IZOcheZtnUAnIItMRPB","gravity_id":"371877527","id":22011,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T14:00:08.228Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T14:20:19.248Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-12T13:50:57.118Z","text_content":"$SOL tools AI memecoin creator .\nAutomatically added liquidity.\n10 seconds and memecoin is ready #BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights# #Altcoin Season# #Meme Alpha# #BNBChain#","gravity_id":"371878494","id":22029,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T14:00:24.900Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T14:10:25.278Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-12T14:07:15.453Z","text_content":"🔥 Firedancer goes live on $SOL   mainnet!  💻 Over 20% of validators now running the full client ⚡ Boosts TPS & decentralization 🏆 Could spark a staking war in 2026 as validators compete for SOL stakes 📉 $SOL   price barely reacts yet at $137.61  #Solana  #SOL","gravity_id":"371877615","id":22055,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T14:10:24.525Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T14:40:19.605Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-12T14:01:54.297Z","text_content":"🚨 Binance froze just 17% of the stolen $SOL  from the Upbit hack.

Tether says the move highlights stablecoins’ growing role in modern finance. The update comes as Binance also secures full ADGM authorization, boosting Abu Dhabi’s crypto ambitions.\n📌 Stripe Charges 1.5% for Stablecoin Transfers That Cost $0.0002 On-Chain\n\nStripe launched stablecoin payment processing with a 1.5% fee for USDC transfers that cost fractions of a cent on-chain, sparking debate over pricing that critics call excessive and defenders justify as infrastructure abstraction.\n\nCritics immediately highlighted the stark disparity between Stripe’s fees and the actual costs of blockchain transactions.\n📌 Malaysia’s Crown Prince Launches $121M Crypto Treasury\n\nMalaysia’s Crown Prince has formally stepped into the digital-asset sector with a new state-backed stablecoin initiative and a large crypto-treasury plan, even as concerns grow over whether the global digital-asset treasury boom has already entered a fragile phase.\n\nThe rollout took place under the supervision of the country’s regulated sandbox, which is overseen by both the Securities Commission and Bank Negara Malaysia, to test financial innovations ranging from stablecoins to programmable payment systems.\n📌 US CFTC Begins Pilot Allowing Digital Assets To Serve As Collateral\n\nThe US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has taken one of its biggest steps yet toward bringing crypto into regulated finance, launching a pilot that lets Bitcoin, Ether and USDC serve as collateral in derivatives markets.\n\nActing Chairman Caroline Pham announced the program in Washington, along with new guidance on tokenized collateral and the withdrawal of older rules that no longer align with the GENIUS Act.\n📌 Upbit Moves Most User Funds to Cold Storage After $30M Hot Wallet Hack\n\nSouth Korea’s largest crypto exchange, Upbit, is pushing almost all customer assets into cold storage after a major hack on its Solana hot wallet, in one of the most aggressive security pivots yet by a big trading platform.\n\nOperator Dunamu said it will lift the share of user funds held in cold wallets to 99% and cut hot wallet exposure to effectively 0%, after hackers stole 44.5B won, about $30m, from a connected wallet.\n\nThe overhaul takes Upbit well beyond South Korea’s Virtual Asset User Protection Act, which requires exchanges to keep at least 80% of customer deposits offline.\n🔗 Watch the full episode now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAGYRRvA0Bo","gravity_id":"371879614","id":22064,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T14:20:04.799Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T14:40:19.180Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-12T14:19:57.237Z","text_content":"AI keeps shaping the 2025 market, and BingX’s approach with AI Bingo, AI Master, and the AI Arena is genuinely interesting to follow.

He’s putting his money where his mouth is — SkyBridge holds a significant portion of SOL, and personally, he’s around 6–7% in his portfolio. But don’t call him a maximalist: he likes Ethereum, Avalanche, and a diversified approach.  With the first US spot Solana staking ETF launching and potential regulatory clarity ahead, Scaramucci thinks $SOL  could hit $300–$400 next year, and maybe even $1,000 in five years.

Identify which asset shows RSI below 30 (oversold) or bullish divergence (price making lower lows while RSI makes higher lows). Provide long setup: entry at current price, TP at nearest resistance level, stop loss at recent swing low, position size 2-3% of portfolio based on RSI strength.\nVerdict: \nNo oversold conditions or bullish divergences present - all RSI readings are neutral to slightly overbought, suggesting waiting for better entry signals.\nFull analysis: \nNone of the three assets currently meet your criteria for a long setup based on RSI(14) on the 15m timeframe 📊\n\nCurrent RSI Readings:\n\nBTC: 48.73 (neutral territory)\nETH: 51.20 (neutral territory)\nSOL: 61.58 (slightly overbought)\n\nAnalysis: No asset shows RSI below 30 (oversold condition). For bullish divergence, I'd need to see price making lower lows while RSI makes higher lows - the current data doesn't show this pattern forming on any of these assets.
