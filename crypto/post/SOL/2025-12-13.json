The decline in network activity amid the decreased need for decentralized applications has a negative impact on the outlook for #SOL  .\r Solana's total #blockchain  value (TVL) has declined by more than $ 10 billion since its peak in September; data on the blockchain shows that user activity is declining at a faster pace.\r The total blockchain blockchain value (TVL) on Solana has been declining since peaking at $ 15 billion in September. Decreased investment in smart contracts is increasing the supply of SOLs for sale. Meanwhile, revenue from decentralized applications (DApps) on Solana fell to $ 26 million per week, down from $ 37 million two months earlier.\r Traders' interest in memcoins has waned since the sharp collapse of the cryptocurrency market on Oct. 10, exposing the vulnerability of leveraged positions and the general liquidity of smaller altcoins. Regardless of whether derivatives markets exacerbated the move, traders have become less confident in dealing with DEX platforms following the $ 19 billion liquidation event. The launch of the decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana in January triggered a surge in volumes to $ 313.3 billion that month.
