Direction matters less than leverage management today.\n\n―――――――――――――――――――\nMarket Summary\n• BTC continues sharp drop → rebound → full retrace cycles, driven by liquidations rather than trend formation\n• Around $90,000 remains heavy on the upside, while breaks below $87,000 accelerate downside moves\n• ETF flows today show continued outflows: BTC -3,371 BTC, ETH -96,870 ETH\n• In contrast, SOL continues to see inflows on both daily and weekly horizons, highlighting capital rotation\n• “Bought but still falling” price action reflects deep supply pressure (Asia spot selling, OG whales, miner stress)\n• Renewed concerns around China’s mining restrictions weigh on sentiment, reinforcing forced-selling narratives\n• ETH corrected into the $2,800 range, yet whales continue accumulating near breakeven cost levels\n• Conclusion: Direction is weak, but fast moves in both directions remain likely\n\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOn-Chain & Technical Trends\n• CVD remains upward even after full retracements, suggesting short-term selling pressure may be fading (with noise)\n• Liquidations near $90,000 indicate positioning cleanup rather than genuine upside strength\n• Signs of miner capitulation: falling profitability → reserve selling = non-discretionary supply\n• Regional divergence remains key: U.S. flows lean buy-side, while Asian exchanges continue net spot selling\n• Increased LTH selling reflects generational supply transfer rather than a clear bearish regime shift\n• Key levels: Below $85,000 risks liquidation cascades; above $93,000 could trigger short covering\n• Implied volatility is rising, signaling the end of the low-volatility regime\n• Today’s priority remains flows, OI, and liquidation spikes over spot price alone\n\n―――――――――――――――――――\nSentiment\n• Fear remains dominant; retail participation is minimal, amplifying wick-heavy price action\n• A classic “Bart within a Bart” choppy market structure—moves designed to shake out positions\n• BTC long buildup on Bitfinex signals energy accumulation, but also creates a hunting ground\n• Short-term edge favors spot exposure, scaling entries, and reduced position size\n• Ahead of major events (BOJ, U.S. political headlines), positioning tends to stay light\n• Conclusion: Focus less on fear intensity and more on how much leverage cleanup has progressed\n• Watch the quality of rebounds after selling pressure pauses, especially volume confirmation\n\n―――――――――――――――――――\nU.S. Traditional Markets\n• U.S. equities are also correcting, with broad risk assets in a deleveraging phase\n• Economic slowdown signals coexist with rate-cut expectations, creating volatility catalysts\n• Fed leadership succession and political factors are increasingly priced alongside policy\n• Elevated equity valuations continue to pressure long-term return expectations\n• Non-U.S. equity indices still lag prior highs, widening relative-strength distortions\n• Medium-term tokenization remains a structural tailwind; short-term markets stay event-driven\n• Ahead of the December 19 BOJ rate hike (25 bp), yen-carry related shocks remain a risk\n• Conclusion: This is not crypto-specific weakness, but a synchronized macro and positioning reset\n\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOverall Assessment\nWith continued ETF outflows in BTC and ETH and thin liquidity, liquidation-driven whipsaws dominate, keeping the score at 22 (mild downtrend). At the same time, signals such as easing sell pressure in CVD and ETH supply contraction with whale accumulation suggest early groundwork for a base.\nKey focus today: (1) ETF flow persistence and SOL rotation, (2) OI/funding skew and liquidation spikes, and (3) downside risk below $85,000 versus rebound quality after a $90,000 recovery.","gravity_id":"372047672","id":33592,"createdAt":"2025-12-17T20:00:03.574Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T21:10:26.239Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-17T20:07:17.558Z","text_content":"On September 26, Eric Trump said that Q4 “would be incredible” for the crypto market.

Volatility likely ahead — manage risk accordingly. ⚠️  #Solana  #SOL","gravity_id":"372070094","id":35143,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T13:20:25.851Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T14:02:46.041Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-18T13:28:31.513Z","text_content":"#LONG\n\n\n$SOL /USDT\n\n\nMargin Mode : Isolated\n\n\nSignal Type : Scalp Trade\n\n\nBUY :\n\n\n1) 124.32 - 100% \n\n\nTake Profit Targets :\n1) 126.17\n2) 128.10\n3) 130.49\n4) 133.73\n5) 137.96\n6) 142.16\n\n\nSL : 120.91 - 100%  \n\n\nLEV : 20X\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Altcoin Season# #BNBChain# #Meme Alpha#","gravity_id":"372072183","id":35159,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T13:30:24.548Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T14:02:45.650Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-18T13:20:10.524Z","text_content":"$SOL  BUY SETUP  📊","gravity_id":"372070153","id":35160,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T13:30:24.744Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T14:02:45.846Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-18T13:37:45.174Z","text_content":"1/2 🚨 SCAM ALERT: Beware of impostor account @AmbientNetwork pretending to be @AmbiosNetwork! \n\nFrom repurposing our posts to using environmental DePIN and AI themes to push a \"plant a tree\" scheme with $AMB or SOL. \n\nThis is likely a phishing scam to steal your funds! \n2/2 Do NOT send tokens, SOL, or connect your wallet to unverified addresses.

BlackRock already has an incredibly successful tokenized product, and is clearly aiming for more. The signs are clear – Wall Street is launching full-speed into tokenization, and they've been given the regulatory green light to do so.\n\nMy Remaining Questions:\n\n➢ Which asset classes are most likely to be tokenized next?\n\n➢ Will generalized issuance platforms like @Securitize  or @SuperstateInc capture the bulk of new demand?\n\n➢ Do large institutions ultimately prefer to issue and manage their own tokens?\n\n➢ Is there room for startups that specialize in narrower or more exotic asset categories?\n\nPrediction #2: ICOs Return in Full Force\n\nYield farming, airdrop farming, points programs… These were shitty, convoluted workarounds to carry out a basic capital markets job—putting assets in the hands of the public.\n\nHundreds of years ago, capital markets learned that direct asset sales to interested investors were the best way to raise capital and get the assets in the hands of aligned investors. Finally, with the departure of Gary Gensler, we have the regulatory tolerance needed for crypto to align with the hundreds of years of wisdom in TradFi.\n\nThe promise of ICOs was direct access between the public and startups raising capital. We tested that model in 2017 and learned we weren't quite ready for it. In 2025, we have both improved sale mechanisms and project quality.\n\nIt's hard to understate the importance of @aztecnetwork's recent public token sale:\n\n- Aztec did the legal work ahead of time to produce a legal opinion that the $AZTEC token is not a security, and therefore can be sold to both U.S. and unaccredited investors\n\n- They did their token sale fully onchain, without a single intermediary, via the Uniswap CCA\n\nThe precedent this sets for both the legal footing of future tokens and the viability of onchain token sales is significant. Hopefully, more projects follow Aztec's lead and use the @Uniswap CCA.\n\nMy Remaining Questions:\n\n➢ Which token sale platforms emerge as the default, and what drives their adoption?\n\n➢ Can the longstanding equity-token misalignment actually be resolved?\n\n➢ Will meaningful progress be made on regulatory constraints like investor accreditation and securities restrictions?\n\n➢ Will high-quality teams choose public token sales, or will the model succumb to adverse selection?\n\nPrediction #3: DeFi Mullet Growth Hits Warp Speed\n\nThe @coinbase  DeFi mullet is growing incredibly fast. The Coinbase front-end has Ethereum, Base, and Solana all as blockchain backends, supplying Coinbase customers with access to DEXs across each of these and DeFi loans via @Morpho. Morpho's Base TVL alone grew by $2.5B since Coinbase's integration.\n\nI expect stablecoin neobanks that use Ethereum as their banking layer to continue to grow significantly this year. These will naturally try to evolve into financial super-apps, with the most obvious next step being the integration of DeFi products to expand customer offerings.\n\nTraditional banks spend billions on points, miles, and cash-back programs to buy users, effectively borrowing against future interchange. A stablecoin neobank could use a token to replicate this dynamic with near-zero marginal cost, making customer acquisition costs almost free or even negative as early users become stakeholders who help grow the network. See what @rainbowdotme is doing with their token to incentivize users and activity on their app, now extend that to a whole category of stablecoin neobanks on Ethereum.\n\nMy Remaining Questions:\n\n➢ How much of this value accrues to incumbents versus opening room for new startups?\n\n➢ Is the fintech neobank layer the UX bridge crypto has always needed to onboard a broader audience?\n\n➢ With apps like @aave fully abstracting away the blockchain, are we finally at a point where chain infrastructure no longer meaningfully shows up in the consumer experience?\n\nPrediction #4: Robotics Tokens Reach Price Mania Despite Being Vaporware\n\nWhile tokenization is the theme of 2026 in crypto, the theme of 2026 in the real world might be robotics. By the end of the year, robots will be walking among us and this will be normal.\n\nClankers will live!\n\nI think this will create a narrative-driven hype bubble not unlike the AI token mania of November 2024 - Jan 2025. Robotics will be a very investable category, but almost entirely contained to privately owned enterprises or large incumbents like Tesla.\n\nNonetheless, degens will degen and as robotics becomes increasingly culturally relevant, traders will find low market cap, low liquidity tokens in order to express that trade.\n\nMy Remaining Question:\n\n➢ Will there be a single token of real substance?\n\n➢ What's the Bittensor for Robotics?\n\nPrediction #5: Quantum Attack Fears Ramp Up\n\nQuantum computing is on the horizon. Billions of dollars are being invested into making a full production quantum computer a reality. It's not a question of if, but when.\n\nThere are millions of dormant bitcoins that will be quantum attacked at the first available opportunity from someone with a sufficiently capable quantum computer. That's a central-bank reserve supply of Bitcoins. Nic Carter thinks this concludes in a quantum race between the U.S. and China to steal the bitcoins before the other.\n\nAll of crypto will have to contend with quantum, ahead of the rest of society. But the internet as we know it will also need to be reconstructed as quantum resilient. Shit is going to break. It's going to be a spectacle.\n\nIn a similar way to how Y2K became a societal meme, I expect quantum attacks to do the same. Prepping your company to become quantum-proof is something that all societies will need to engage in. Culturally speaking, this is going to get loud.\n\nTo be clear, in 2026, it will still be relatively quiet. It'll be a niche issue for the hobbyists and enthusiasts who care about the matter. But these conversations will set a course for the point when this will all boil over. If you decide to pay attention in 2026, you'll simply notice this growing as an issue, as quantum capacity grows and urgency escalates.\n\nMy Remaining Questions:\n\n➢ We still aren't all that clear on the feasibility of creating a full-production quantum computer on the near-term timelines you see tossed around on Twitter – does that change anytime soon?\n\n➢ How straightforward will it be for our technological society to adapt to quantum?\n\n➢ Maybe everything is a lot less of a ruckus than I'm predicting?","gravity_id":"372076321","id":35505,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T16:20:03.940Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T16:30:25.618Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-18T16:19:15.978Z","text_content":"$SOL \r \r daily RSI bullish divergence has historically been a solid bottom signal.\r \r right now we are painting the 5th daily RSI bullish divergence ~$125 monthly support in the past 2 years.\r \r send $SOL  back to $200+ with haste.\r \r #SOLANA  ⚡️","gravity_id":"372073482","id":35525,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T16:20:25.347Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T16:50:28.012Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-18T16:18:41.292Z","text_content":"$SOL  Long setup:\r Entry: 123.58\r SL: 122.38","gravity_id":"372076340","id":35526,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T16:20:25.543Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T16:40:26.047Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-18T16:17:53.846Z","text_content":"$SOL  is back at the 'Launchpad.' 🚀 Testing the $100–$130 support zone for the first time in months. \r \r Is this the ultimate entry for the 2026 rally?","gravity_id":"372075345","id":35527,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T16:20:25.743Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T16:40:26.242Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-18T16:13:33.230Z","text_content":"$SOL  guys is it just another red week ? or is something happenening","gravity_id":"372076295","id":35528,"createdAt":"2025-12-18T16:20:26.136Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-18T16:30:25.816Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-18T16:28:36.796Z","text_content":"$SOL\n(SOL). 💰\n\n\nDuring its decline, SOL's price swept liquidity from the previous low at $121.5 and remained above it.
