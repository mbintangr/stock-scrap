Price is trading around the $175 area, which aligns with the lower boundary of a long-term ascending channel. This zone has historically acted as strong demand, making it a key level for both swing traders and long-term investors.\n\n\nMomentum indicators are cooling but not broken. RSI is near the neutral zone, suggesting selling pressure is slowing, while MACD remains weak, confirming short-term caution. A clean bounce from this channel support could open the door for a recovery toward $200–$210, and if momentum builds, the higher-timeframe targets around $300, $500, and even the long-term projection near $1,000 stay structurally valid.\n\n\nOn the downside, a confirmed breakdown below the channel would likely send SOL toward the $120 region, a major historical support and high-probability accumulation zone. From a profitability standpoint, this setup favors patience and level-based execution: buyers watch for confirmation at support, while risk remains well-defined if the structure fails.\n\n\nIn short, SOL is not weak — it’s being tested.

Yet beneath the surface, smart money leaned in.  🐋 What changed: • A whale wallet bought 41,000 SOL (~$5M) during the dip • Same wallet previously accumulated near $122 and sold at $175 for $1.28M profit • History is repeating — buy fear, not strength  📊 Institutional signal: • $11M in SOL ETF inflows absorbed spot selling • ETFs quietly accumulated while price weakened  📉 Network activity slowed — but not structurally broken 📈 Price defended $117–$120, bouncing back into the $122–$145 accumulation range  This wasn’t panic selling. It was retail stepping back… and bigger players stepping forward.  Fear fades. Positioning remains.

The bounce from the 125.40–125.60 support zone was clean, followed by higher lows and steady consolidation near 126.30. This behavior suggests buyers are still active and defending dips rather than allowing deeper continuation to the downside. As long as price holds above the 126.00 base, the structure remains favorable for a continuation push toward the recent highs.\n\n\nFrom a long trade perspective, continuation is favored if SOL sustains above 126.00 and builds acceptance above 126.50. A clean break and hold above the 126.80–127.00 resistance zone could open the path toward the 127.80–128.50 range, where sellers previously stepped in. The market is not showing aggressive rejection yet, which keeps the upside scenario valid, especially if volume expands on the next push.\n\n\nOn the flip side, the short trade opportunity only becomes attractive if SOL fails to hold 126.00 and shows strong rejection near 126.80–127.00. A breakdown back below 125.90 would shift momentum in favor of sellers and expose the 125.20–124.80 liquidity zone. Until that happens, shorts remain counter-trend and higher risk.\n\n\nShort Outlook:\nNeutral to mildly bullish above 126.00.
