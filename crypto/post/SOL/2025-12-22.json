Payment routing is also more dynamic in V2, so the destination of a payment can change per request. That enables revenue sharing, shared APIs, and dynamic pricing without changing the API itself.\n\nA Standard Extension Format for Plug-ins\n\nPreviously, extending @coinbase's x402 often meant updating the core protocol or SDK, a tedious and unrealistic condition.\n\nIn V2, those changes move out of the core and into standardized extensions. The protocol now supports and expects plugins, so new functionality can be added as optional extensions without requiring a system-wide upgrade. This also enables automatic discovery: services can publish machine-readable metadata that describes their paid APIs (what they do, what they cost, and what payment options they accept), and facilitators can ingest that data into an API-first directory that agents and SDKs can query. The core stays stable while features evolve at the edges, and the SDK can dynamically select chains, assets, and facilitators based on simple developer preferences.\n\nWallet-Based Access and Reusable Sessions\n\nThe third major change is wallet-based access and reusable sessions, which brings x402 in line with how access works on the modern internet.\n\nIn V1, every API call required completing the full payment flow, which effectively enforced a pure per-request micropayment model. That's not how most users or agents expect systems to work today, where subscriptions and session-based access dominate. V2 preserves the balance-based model while enabling reusable access after purchase, cutting latency and avoiding repeated onchain calls. This makes subscriptions, sessions, and repeated access patterns possible for both humans and agents.\n\nWhat the Data Actually Shows\n\nSo the protocol has improved. But is anyone actually using it? Given the continued \"all time highs\" of transaction volumes advertised in posts, you'd think yes. And to an extent, you'd be right. But as with many network metrics in our industry, they need to be sterilized once gamed or meme-related volume has been removed.\n\nIn the case of x402, @OnchainLu of onchain data provider @artemis believes this illegitimate activity accounts for 47% of all x402 transactions to date, mostly from teams gaming leaderboards to climb x402scan rankings.\n\nThat sounds damning, but it represents only 14% of total dollar volume, and gamed activity correlates strongly with legitimate transaction activity. Some of it is also just teams testing infrastructure. As projects move from testing to production, these percentages should decline.\n\nWhere Real Usage Lives\n\nFor the 53% of transactions that Artemis classifies as legitimate, those come from servers offering high-frequency, low-cost services where micropayments make sense. Artemis highlights AISA, @x402secure , LucyOS, @AgentLISA_ai, and @heurist_ai as exemplars, processing millions of micropayments with near-zero artificial activity. While in October and November the vast majority occurred on @base (86% of transactions and 89% of volume), in December activity's migrated to @solana which processes ~36% of transactions and ~72% of volume, largely from agent-to-agent services.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nOverall, sift through the \"spam\" transactions and you'll see a lot's going right for x402.\n\nWhat's still to come is verifying the legitimacy of agents and services, which ERC-8004 will help with but still remains in its early stages, as well as service providers adopting x402.\n\nWe'll probably overestimate how fast agentic commerce takes off in the short term, but do the opposite for its growth in the long term.\n\nIn the meantime, if you're a builder, tinker around with V2, share what you make in the x402 builders chat. If you're an investor keep a level head about the technology. If x402 memes are your thing, there's no shame in that but if you're looking for a long-term bet it's best to hold off as the technology itself has some proving to do.","gravity_id":"372194957","id":43515,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T14:10:02.736Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-22T14:20:28.709Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-22T14:06:56.319Z","text_content":"$SOL ema and ma is solid doesnt seem wild though","gravity_id":"372196464","id":43525,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T14:10:26.361Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-22T14:20:28.250Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-22T13:58:45.038Z","text_content":"With Ethereum, Solana, and many Layer 2s reducing block times, the old indexing model is broken.
