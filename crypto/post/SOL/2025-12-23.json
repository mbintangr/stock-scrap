At the same time, the 85,000 demand zone and extreme risk-off conditions can generate sharp rebounds and “failed breakdown” wicks, so the score stays at 34 (mild downtrend).\nToday’s focus: (1) Do BTC/ETH ETF flows show stabilization (even slower outflows can change the tone)? (2) Can BTC reclaim POC and the 90,000–92,000 zone? (3) Does ETH show taker-buy recovery and OI rebuilding (confirming a shift from “selling cooled” to “buying returns”)?","gravity_id":"372206458","id":44204,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T21:00:05.644Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-22T21:20:31.509Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-22T20:59:49.314Z","text_content":"$SOL   /USD Sell Trade Signal\r Entry: 126.84\r \r Stop Loss: 129.88\r \r Target 1: 123.70\r \r Target 2: 121.9\r \r Target 3: 120.12\r \r Trade is active.\r \r #USNonFarmPayrollReport  #TrumpTariffs","gravity_id":"372207502","id":44223,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T21:00:29.489Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-22T21:30:30.254Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-22T20:57:44.824Z","text_content":"🔮 $SOL  vibes for 2026 are getting louder.

As products expanded and new markets came online, the underlying platform continued to strengthen in step.\n                                                                              \nHere’s what we built in the past 365 days 👇\n\nLaunching New Products\nThe Gemini Credit Card evolved with the release of the Bitcoin, Solana, XRP, and American Business versions of the card, allowing our US customers to earn rewards in crypto, and additional benefits for businesses.*\n\nWe launched the Gemini Wallet, giving users a powerful self-custody wallet to have more control over their digital assets and manage their finances onchain.\n\nIn the European Union (EU), Gemini launched Tokenized Stocks**, bringing the world’s leading equities onto the blockchain with zero trading fees.\n\nWe added Gemini Perpetuals** in the EU, putting the power of crypto derivatives with up to 100x leverage in the hands of advanced traders, and have continued to expand the number of perpetual contracts available – opening up new trading opportunities in memecoins, DeFi, and beyond.\n\nIn Europe, users gained the ability to stake*** their ETH and SOL, unlocking the potential to earn rewards of up to 6% APR**** on their holdings.\n\nIn Singapore, we launched Index Perpetual Contracts and expanded the available cross collateral funding options. We also made funding faster for Singapore users by adding PayNow and FAST.\n\nWe introduced USD rails to our UK institutional customers, giving them more flexibility in the ways they can trade.\n\nInstitutional Leadership\nWe strengthened our leadership in institutional custody, including custodying Empery Digital’s $500 million BTC placement and facilitated their bitcoin purchases and derivatives trades. We also introduced the ability to stake SOL from custody for our institutional partners.\n\nWe worked with Glassnode to produce the Bitcoin Adoption, Volatility, and Market Cap report, showing that bitcoin treasuries now control nearly a third of Bitcoin’s total supply.\n\nCompany Milestones & Regulation\nAfter an IPO on the Nasdaq stock exchange in September, Gemini became a publicly traded company.\n\nThis year also marked a turning point for Gemini’s global ambitions. In October, Gemini launched in Australia and became AUSTRAC registered to bring industry-leading crypto tools to users down under. We also expanded further into the country by adding AUD banking rails for faster payments and deposits.\n\nWe opened new offices around the world, including London, hosting an opening party with people from across the industry to celebrate. We also grew our customer service operations with a new office in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nIn the EU, we obtained our Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) licences, allowing us to bring our services to millions more across the region.\n\nFostering a Global Community\nFrom DAS New York and Paris Blockchain Week, to TOKEN2049 in Singapore and the Australian Crypto Convention in Sydney, the Gemini team met local communities around the world.\n\nIn March, we set a Guinness World Record for the largest aerial display of a currency symbol with a drone show at South by Southwest in Texas. In May, we teamed up with MARA Holdings to mine the Bitcoin “pizza block”, a tribute to the first real-world purchase using bitcoin.\n\nAt BTC Vegas, we gave orange Tesla Cybertrucks to two lucky winners, while at BTC Amsterdam, we awarded a custom Bitcoin Apex Flare 4 Bike to a new customer. We left our mark on Amsterdam too, by biking around the city in the shape of a Bitcoin “₿” and decking out the city’s trams with our signature colors.\n\nThe Gemini team also headed to Real Bedford football club to give out free pizza and merch to  fans at the final match of the season, and celebrated the team’s promotion to Premier Division Central.\n\nLooking to the Future\nAs we look to 2026, our focus has never been clearer. We plan to build on the successes of this year and continue offering secure and reliable access to digital assets, by pushing further with new product launches, deepened institutional ties, and an expanded presence in the EU and APAC.\n\nWe’re proud of what we built and scaled in 2025 – and this was just the beginning.\n\nOnward and upward,\nTeam Gemini\n\nFull recap here: https://t.co/hIjcQcsHwF\n\n* Gemini-branded credit products are issued by WebBank.\n\n** Perpetuals and Tokenized Stocks are offered by Gemini Intergalactic EU Artemis, Ltd, which is authorised and regulated by the MFSA under the Investment Services Act to offer certain services under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) to institutions and traders.

Growing the DeFi Mullet\n\nWhile @base has grown alongside Coinbase, Coinbase has also leaned on Base, using it to offer a unique suite of hybrid onchain/offchain products (commonly referred to as the DeFi mullet) that apply centralized finance convenience to DeFi flexibility.\n\nHere are some of the top efforts:\n\n➢ Onchain Loans — Through Coinbase, U.S. users can borrow up to $5M in USDC against BTC or up to $1M against ETH, enabled by the exchange's direct integration with the Morpho lending protocol on Base.\n\nYour BTC auto-converts to cbBTC, deposits into Morpho, and your USDC arrives in under a minute. Compare this against the week-long process of applying for a bank loan and it becomes clear how superior crypto's systems are. So far, this feature has seen $1.5B borrowed and $1.6B in collateralized BTC, with nearly 19K borrowers to date.\n\n➢ Yield Opportunities — Beyond borrowing, Coinbase users have access to a series of yield options. They can deposit USDC directly into @Morpho vaults to earn yields higher than typical 4% savings rates, timed nicely as rate cuts reduce traditional yields. For those seeking maximally compliant liquidity venues, Verified Pools offer specialized @Uniswap  v4 pools open only to Coinbase-KYC'd users, optimized by risk-management firm @gauntlet_xyz.\n\n➢ DEX Integration — Coinbase also integrated DEX trading directly into its exchange, allowing U.S. users (minus New York...) to trade Base tokens without leaving the app. When you make your first trade, the app creates a self-custody wallet — you hold the keys, but the UX looks just like buying tokens normally on the exchange, with all swap fees sponsored. For traders, it's onchain access without the usual friction. For Base projects, it's expanded distribution to millions of more users.\n\nTaken together, the combo of accessible loans, competitive yields, and DEX integration positions Coinbase to function as much as a neobank as it is an exchange, a bold vision enabled by Base.\n\n2. Scaling Builder Tools & Programs\n\nBase stands out for its builder-first growth ethos. Instead of elaborate governance structures, the chain has developed tools and programs that reward and support existing builders and lower the barrier for new ones.\n\n➢ Builder Programs — Base organizes a global builder program called Base Batches for pre-accelerator talent, with dedicated tracks for AI, stablecoins, and consumer apps. Structured around a series of hackathons, the program aims to provide early-stage support and possible pathways to incubators and venture funding. Meanwhile, Base Build offers a development dashboard with real-time user analytics from launch, along with a monetization option through builder rewards.\n\n➢ Toolkits — For plug-and-play infrastructure, Base provides a set of tools, including Embedded Wallets for account abstraction, Base Pay for USDC checkout within applications, and Sign on with Base, which streamlines account creation and onboarding.\n\n➢ x402 — Perhaps the most forward-looking addition has been x402, an open payments standard that allows payments to be attached to web requests. The protocol solves the hassle of traditional API access by letting you pay automatically based on usage, per-call or per-inference, with payment happening instantly as part of the request. This enables AI agents to act as true, autonomous service providers, managing all the expenses and access they need to run operations independently.\n\nThe through line here is accessibility. By equipping builders to ship faster, Base stimulates its onchain economy, makes it easy for people to experiment onchain, and positions their L2 as a positive-sum environment.\n\n3. Shipping New Technical Upgrades\n\nBeyond brand power and product launches, Base kept making under-the-hood improvements, strengthening security, slashing latency, and expanding connectivity.\n\n➢ Decentralization — In April, Base hit Stage 1 decentralization with the launch of permissionless fault proofs and the implementation of a security council. This strengthened the chain's security and reduced its trust assumptions, particularly important given the chain's close relationship with a shareholder-owned public entity.\n\n➢ Scaling — July brought the debut of Flashblocks, which slashed block times from 2 seconds to 200 milliseconds, moving transactions into \"instant\" territory. In December, Base launched a native Solana bridge using @chainlink CCIP, enabling SPL token support within Base applications and cross-chain actions where transactions on one chain can trigger transactions on the other. It's the first non-Ethereum chain connected to Base, positioning it as a hub where every asset can exist across every network.\n\nThese upgrades lay the groundwork for Base to compete on performance, not just distribution, while reducing the trust assumptions that come with being tied to a centralized exchange.\n\n4. Laying Out the Next Phase of Base\n\nBeyond infrastructure and product releases, two big developments stood out: the first showcasing a new method for traversing the chain, and the second (soft) confirming something many had hoped for from the beginning.\n\n➢ Base App — Base launched the Base App in July and has expanded it to 140+ countries, replacing Coinbase Wallet as the ecosystem's primary interface and signaling a shift toward social-first crypto. The app integrates chat, trading, social features, and mini-app discovery all wrapped up in one familiar feed. It currently has 169K registered users, and while many are certainly there to farm the chain's upcoming token, there is a core group of users embracing its call to \"just coin it,\" and tokenize their media onchain.\n\n➢ BASE Token — At Base Camp in September, the team publicly confirmed they're \"exploring\" a native token. Given the soft framing, it's likely it will be some time before a BASE token goes live. In the meantime, airdrop hunters are getting active as it's almost certain that onchain activity will be rewarded if they pursue an airdrop as part of a possible token launch.\n\nTogether, these moves sketch a vision of Base as a living ecosystem with its own culture and incentives, one where participation, especially as a builder, can pay off handsomely.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nBase's 2025 was defined by stacking advantages.\n\nThe symbiosis with Coinbase has proven mutually beneficial: Base gets a built-in distribution mechanism and trusted brand for onboarding newcomers, while Coinbase gets the infrastructure to offer hybrid products that meaningfully distinguish it from competitors. At the same time, the chain's builder-first ethos has cultivated a positive-sum environment that stood out during a year that was all over the place. And with Stage 1 decentralization achieved, Base has made meaningful progress in reducing the trust assumptions that naturally accompany an exchange-backed L2.\n\nThe result is the most successful exchange-backed L2 to date, built on a foundation that positions it well for the next phase of growth. Its most credible near-term challenger may be Robinhood's L2, which, if launched, could prove to be an ultimate test for the chain's staying power.\n\nIt may still be day one for the chain, but the momentum suggests it is building toward something much larger.","gravity_id":"372228237","id":45583,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T14:50:29.323Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T15:00:29.302Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-23T14:57:27.275Z","text_content":"Solana just rolled out Kora, an upgrade focused on smoother onboarding.

Historically, crypto drawdowns were driven by macro shocks, not an internal clock. China’s banking restrictions in 2014. Global tightening and regulatory pressure in 2018. Liquidity reversal, inflation, and systemic deleveraging in 2022. Crypto traded like other risk assets because it is a risk asset.\n\nWhat has changed is the market foundation.\n\nETF access has opened the advisory and wealth management channel. Institutional-grade custody exists. Regulatory clarity is improving rather than constricting. As a result, the conversation has shifted from whether digital assets belong in portfolios to how exposure should be constructed.\n\nBitcoin is increasingly viewed as a macro asset and store of value within that framework. Infrastructure protocols such as Chainlink were highlighted for solving a fundamental constraint. Blockchains cannot access real-world data on their own. Chainlink provides that connectivity layer, with visible on-chain usage, interoperability across networks, and integration with traditional financial infrastructure. For institutions, that translates into picks-and-shovels exposure tied to real economic activity.\n\nSolana was discussed from a usage-first perspective. High throughput, low and predictable costs, strong developer activity, growing stablecoin flows, and real transaction volume. From Grayscale’s viewpoint, Solana’s relevance shows up in how people actually use the network and in the demand coming from retail, wealth, and institutional channels, including ETF and staking products.\n\nAnother clear signal of maturity is the decline of tribalism. \n\nAs access becomes standardized through ETFs, exposure management replaces ecosystem loyalty. Investors are no longer choosing a single chain. They are allocating across stores of value, infrastructure layers, and income-producing assets within one asset class.\n\nThe outlook discussed was bullish, but not speculative. Improving regulation. Broader access. Institutional demand. Yield through staking. Tokenization and infrastructure moving from concept to execution.\n\nThis interview was not about timing markets. It was about recognizing that digital assets are no longer operating outside the financial system.\n\nThey are being integrated into it.\n\nThe institutional era of digital assets is upon us. \n\n@Grayscale @Ray_scale \n\nFull Interview:","gravity_id":"372226899","id":45674,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T15:40:07.827Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T16:10:31.170Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-23T15:31:28.478Z","text_content":"🚨BUY/SELL  LEVELS \n #SOL  $SOL","gravity_id":"372229083","id":45686,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T15:40:30.184Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T16:10:31.407Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-23T15:31:09.389Z","text_content":"Upexi files a $1B shelf registration as it pivots beyond consumer brands and builds a Solana-focused crypto treasury.

That’s where shorts get trapped. The higher-probability play is to ride the bounce toward resistance, then reassess.\n\nThis is a scalp-to-relief move, not a trend reversal. Take TP step by step and trail once TP1 is hit.\n\nSupport Zones\n• 123.5 – 122.8 (primary demand)\n• 122.1 – 121.0 (strong base)\nResistance Zones\n• 125.8 – 126.5 (first rejection)\n• 128.5 – 130.0 (major supply)\nNo FOMO. Let price come to you.\nAnd remember — if you’re not following Token Talk, you’re making a mistake. These $SOL levels don’t appear after the move, they appear before it.\n#sol","gravity_id":"372230329","id":45821,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T17:00:29.885Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T17:30:30.967Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-23T17:00:36.406Z","text_content":"#Solana  ETFs recorded $7.47 million in net inflows in the latest session, signaling continued institutional accumulation despite broader market weakness.

While the broader market struggled, Monero kept climbing,then reality checked in fast. A sharp 8.5% dip in the last 24 hours snapped the streak. Still, zoom out and the picture changes: +6.8% this week, +17.2% over 14 days, +9.4% monthly, and a wild +129.5% since December 2024. The pullback hurts, but the trend hasn’t vanished yet. The real question now isn’t panic,it’s whether XMR resets and runs again.  At the same time, $SOL  is making a very different kind of move.
