(Strategic Decision)\n\nThe Polygon network played an important role, but the landscape has changed over the past months. We have identified:\n\n​• Loss of Traction: A significant reduction in the Polygon ecosystem.\n\n• Limited Liquidity: Lower depth in DEXs (decentralized exchanges).\n\n• Instability: Recurring RPC issues, delays, and operational failures.\n\n• Impact of POL: The sharp decline of the network's base currency amplifies the negative impact.\n\n​🚀 The Solana Advantage: Currently, Solana concentrates the highest market traction and liquidity. We are repositioning EXD into a more competitive, scalable, and attractive ecosystem for the next cycle.\n\n​🔁 How the Migration Will Work (IMPORTANT)\n\n​The migration will be 1:1. You will receive the exact same amount of EXD on the Solana network.\n\n​1️⃣ For holders with EXD on the EADX Exchange:\n• The migration will be automatic. No action is required.\n\n​2️⃣ For holders with EXD in wallets (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.):\n• You must send your EXD to the official project address (provided in the form).\n\n• In the Official Form, you will provide:\n- Your sending address (current wallet).\n- Your Solana receiving address.\n• After validation, the new EXD tokens will be sent to your Solana wallet.\n\n​📊 Supply and Tokenomics\n\n• Max Supply: 1,000,000 (1M) EXD.\n\n• Locked Tokens: 825,000 EXD remain locked until the end of 2026.\n\n• Liquidity: A new pool will be opened on Raydium (Solana’s leading DEX).\n\n• Buyback: The $1,000–$1,500 planned buyback will be redirected as initial liquidity on Solana.\n\n​🎯 What This Means\nWe are placing EXD where the financial volume is happening. This is the move that precedes major growth phases.\n\n​📌 The official form will be published today. Once live, the message will be pinned.\n\n​Stay tuned for the next announcements.\n\n​Best,\nEADX Team","gravity_id":"372233091","id":45992,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T18:30:34.288Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T19:00:30.740Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-23T18:37:45.059Z","text_content":"Prediction markets don’t fail because people stop predicting.\nThey fail when liquidity can’t scale with conviction.\n\nThat’s exactly the problem @intodotspace is solving - and why it caught my attention.\n\nSpace isn’t built for casual bets or novelty markets.\nIt’s a high-performance prediction layer on Solana, designed for leverage, throughput, and sustained volume.\n\nWhat stands out to me:\n🔹 10× leverage for traders with high-conviction views\n🔹 Zero maker fees + protocol buyback & burn mechanics\n🔹 Liquidity-first market architecture (this is the real unlock)\n🔹 Competitive seasons that keep volume alive, not episodic\n🔹 Built by the team behind the $1.5B UFO ecosystem - proven at scale\n\nMost prediction apps try to look fun.\nSpace is trying to work under pressure.\n\nThis isn’t a betting product.\nIt’s infrastructure for pricing belief- continuously, competitively, and at scale.\n\nIntoDotSpace isn’t experimenting with prediction markets.\nThey’re engineering the ones that can survive real volume.","gravity_id":"372233166","id":46006,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T18:40:28.734Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T19:30:31.151Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-23T18:31:45.054Z","text_content":"🚨 JUST IN: Coinbase now supports SOL deposits and withdrawals via the Base network.\n\n#Coinbase #Solana #SOL #Base #CryptoNews #Blockchain ","gravity_id":"372232598","id":46007,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T18:40:28.970Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T19:20:29.819Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-23T18:48:33.263Z","text_content":"$16B in stablecoins and 200% YTD growth.

Trading below moving averages, SOL is heading toward the $95 demand zone. Bulls must defend it. Lose it, and the downside opens fast: → $80 → $50  But here’s the flip side: If SOL reclaims the moving averages, it enters a massive range: → $95 to $260  A clean breakout above $260 could unlock: → $425  Solana doesn’t crawl. It teleports.  If altseason favors speed, scalability, and developers—SOL will be one of the loudest trades of 2026.  #SOL  #Solana","gravity_id":"372235642","id":46279,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T21:20:28.650Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T22:00:31.241Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-23T21:13:57.870Z","text_content":"$SOL has 2 decent liquidity clusters right now\n\nOn the upside, there's a liquidity cluster at the $130 level, and on the downside, there's a liquidity cluster at the $115 level\n\nWhich level do you think SOL will hit first?\n#Crypto","gravity_id":"372234636","id":46280,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T21:20:28.878Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T21:50:30.398Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-23T21:28:29.545Z","text_content":"Prediction markets only work when data is trusted ⚡️  $POL  has become the go-to for onchain prediction markets because liquidity is deep and execution stays clean under pressure.  $SOL  continues to grow, but peak activity still exposes friction where speed alone isn’t enough.

IOTA focuses on making external data, events, and outcomes verifiable at the protocol level. When markets resolve, the result needs proof, not opinion.  As prediction markets expand beyond crypto-native bets into real-world events, data integrity becomes the edge.  Speed gets you trades. Trust keeps markets alive.

Transactions finalize quickly and cost very little, making the network feel more like a traditional consumer app platform than a blockchain.  📈The chain has developed strong organic usage. Large numbers of users actively trade, mint, play, and interact on Solana every day, which shows demand beyond speculation. This level of activity gives the ecosystem resilience and real economic throughput.  📈Solana’s low fees enable use cases that are not practical on more expensive networks. Micropayments, gaming, social applications, and high-frequency trading all benefit from fast execution and predictable costs.  📈Developer interest has rebounded and continued to grow. Improved tooling, better documentation, and ecosystem funding have made Solana an attractive environment for building new applications.  📈Reliability has improved significantly over time. Network upgrades and multiple validator clients have reduced downtime risk and strengthened decentralization.  📈SOL itself has clear utility. It is required for transaction fees, staking, and securing the network, which ties token demand to actual usage.  📈Solana is particularly well positioned for consumer-facing crypto. If adoption expands beyond finance into everyday digital experiences, Solana’s performance advantages become increasingly important.  📈📈Long term thesis📈📈 If crypto shifts toward real-world usage and high-volume applications, Solana stands to benefit as a fast, low-cost execution layer built for scale.","gravity_id":"372244585","id":46907,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T06:40:16.260Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T08:00:21.789Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-24T06:50:04.628Z","text_content":"$SOL Bearish deeper","gravity_id":"372245172","id":46915,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T06:50:17.053Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T08:10:17.187Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-24T06:55:45.258Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\n$SOL Price Prediction: Targeting $110 Support Before $150 Recovery by Mid-January 2025\n\nSOL price prediction suggests a test of $110 support before potential recovery to $150 by mid-January, with current bearish momentum likely to persist short-term.\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372245221","id":46924,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T07:00:05.193Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T08:10:16.867Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-24T06:55:45.135Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nA Whale Who Shorted $SOL 20x is Gradually Closing Its Position, with an Overall Short Profit of Over $27.7 Million\n\nerror\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372244709","id":46934,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T07:00:17.902Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T08:10:16.976Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-24T06:52:45.065Z","text_content":"Solana Testing Resistance: Will a Bullish Breakout Follow Soon?
