You have helped shape BounceBit through 2025 with feedback, support, and daily participation across the ecosystem.\n\n2025 was a year of execution and expansion.\n\nKey moments from 2025:\n- V3 launch, a major upgrade to BounceBit’s core architecture and product set\n- Deployments on Base and Solana, expanding our multi chain footprint\n- Consistent traction, averaging $450 to $550M in TVL throughout the year\n\nWe also validated the Prime direction in a real way. We proved that institutional RWAs can be turned into a scalable onchain yield stack. Prime is anchored by BENJI through our partnership with Franklin Templeton and complemented by BlackRock’s BUIDL brought onchain in collaboration with Securitize.\n\nOver the last quarter, we stayed focused on fundamentals. Hardening infrastructure, tightening risk controls, and improving transparency so the protocol is ready to scale responsibly. One of the reasons why we were left unharmed on 10/10.\n\nLooking into 2026, the focus stays straightforward:\n- Expand institutional distribution\n- Keep shipping products that give tokenized assets real utility\n- Keep providing real yield on otherwise idle assets\n\nIn parallel, we are also gearing up to launch BounceBit Perps - our own perpetuals DEX that will incorporate BB-tokens as collateral and an innovative liquidity pool. We will share more when it is ready.\n\nChristmas update for the community: we are restarting buybacks with 500,000 BB. This is a simple year end signal of alignment and a thank you to everyone building with us.\n\nEnjoy the holidays, take a breather, and come back ready for 2026. We are here, we are building, and execution will define everything from here.","gravity_id":"372258548","id":47838,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T18:00:17.770Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T18:40:17.161Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-24T18:19:45.104Z","text_content":"🤝 Partnership Announcement: @Aidica_xyz × @Custodiy1\n\nWe’re proud to announce a strategic partnership between Aidica, a next-generation Solana ICO launchpad focused on vetted, unruggable projects, and Custodiy, a secure smart contract infrastructure for real-world, stablecoin-backed payments.\n\nThis collaboration brings trustless payment protection and on-chain contract security to early-stage fundraising, strengthening investor confidence and transparent capital deployment.\n\n🚀 Aidica: Curated ICOs, real utility, investor cashback rewards\n🔐 Custodiy: Guaranteed payment contracts, multichain support, compliance-focused design\n\nTogether, we’re setting a higher standard for secure fundraising and investor protection in Web3.\n\n#Partnership #Aidica #Custodiy #Solana #Web3 #ICO #SmartContracts","gravity_id":"372258670","id":47861,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T18:20:15.664Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-24T19:30:18.358Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-24T18:19:00.055Z","text_content":"$SOL  is respecting a clear downtrend, with price continuing to make lower highs and lower lows after repeated rejections near the $127–$130 supply zone.

However, cycle-low whale inflows, falling CDD, and the ongoing build-up in stablecoin liquidity point to “seller exhaustion + a liquidity floor,” increasing the odds of abrupt rebounds. Total score is 34 (mild downtrend).\nKey watchpoints today: (1) signs of stabilization or reversal in BTC spot ETF flows, (2) post-expiry gamma roll-off and which direction the range breaks, (3) the $88k–$89k “magnet” zone vs downside defense around $85k, and (4) whether diversification flows into SOL/XRP persist or rotate back into BTC.","gravity_id":"372262500","id":48112,"createdAt":"2025-12-24T22:00:02.474Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T00:40:17.526Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-24T21:53:13.940Z","text_content":"Crazy 48H isn’t just for whales.
