Strong ecosystem, active DeFi and RWA growth, but price is still weighed down by previous distribution. I treat this as a range to accumulate, not something to chase vertically.\nEntry Plan\nI am scaling in, not aping in.\nStarter size around current levels in the low‑$120s.\nAdd if we see a dip toward the high‑teens.\nOnly if the market really flushes, final add in the low‑$110s.\nSize gets larger the lower we go so my best size is closer to the prior swing lows.\nInvalidation And Risk\nI run two layers of risk control.\nLocal stops sit just below each level I am keying off, so if a zone fails hard I do not bag hold that tranche.\nStructural invalidation is if SOL starts accepting well below the recent lows on strong volume. At that point I assume the range has broken and I am prepared to cut most or all of the position.\nBreakout Plan\nIf SOL breaks and holds above the low‑$130s, I stop assuming we will revisit the deep bids.\nI cancel or move up most of the low‑$110s orders.\nI then treat former resistance as potential support and look for pullbacks above that zone instead of waiting forever for “perfect” .\n\n#Macro Insights# #BNBChain# #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372282524","id":49253,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T18:30:16.521Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T18:30:16.521Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-25T18:28:14.836Z","text_content":"I’m bearish on $SOL","gravity_id":"372283310","id":49254,"createdAt":"2025-12-25T18:30:16.653Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-25T19:20:18.634Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-25T18:26:31.824Z","text_content":"$SOL   with a bullish retest above $120 support.

With Meteoras' optimized DLMMs, you don’t have to bet on up or down.  You decide how you experience price movement.  Meteora’s DLMMs let LPs: • concentrate liquidity where trading actually happens • earn fees from back-and-forth price action • stay productive even when markets look ugly  This is why choppy, sideways markets, the ones traders hate, are often the best environments for LPs.  Fees don’t care about narrative. They care about activity.  DLMMs turn chaos into cash flow by taking advantage of volatility instead of running from it.  When markets shake people out, disciplined LPs stay active.  Same market. Different mindset.
