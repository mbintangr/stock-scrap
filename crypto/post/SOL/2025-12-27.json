With Layer 1-2s offering near-zero fees, ETH / SOL become the primary yield-bearing collateral that powers the entire global agentic economy.\n\n2. The #x402 Standard: AI Agent wallets transition to the x402 payment protocol. This allows agents to perform autonomous \"pay-per-request\" transactions for APIs and compute in milliseconds, effectively removing humans from the daily checkout loop.\n\n3. Digital Labor Economy: AI is no longer just a tool; it is \"#DigitalLabor.\" By late 2026, decentralized AI agents generate more on-chain revenue than traditional gig-economy platforms, with all proceeds flowing back to token holders.\n\n4. Proof of Provenance (#PoP): As AI-generated content dominates 90% of the web, the blockchain serves as the \"source of truth.\" Every verified post on https://t.co/oTyGCZhyGF will require a PoP hash to distinguish human-led insights from bot-driven noise.\n\n5. #DePIN 2.0: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) solve the global GPU shortage. Localized \"Compute Micro-grids\" earn rewards for providing inference power to decentralized models.\n\n6. #Humanoid Robot On-Boarding: Tesla Optimus and other humanoids are issued Sovereign DIDs (Decentralized IDs). They use their own crypto wallets to pay for maintenance, electricity, and software upgrades autonomously.\n\n7. The #RWA Explosion: Tokenized Real-World Assets hit $2 Trillion. AI \"Chief Liquidity Officers\" (L3 Agents) manage these portfolios, using decentralized #Stablecoin as the ultimate low-risk reserve asset.\n\n8. #ZKML Privacy Scaling: Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML) becomes the global standard for private data. It allows AI to \"prove\" its intelligence without ever seeing the user's raw, encrypted information.\n\n9. The Death of the 4-Year Cycle: The market moves into a \"Perpetual Utility Cycle.\" Prices are driven by Agentic Gas Consumption and AI compute demand rather than #Bitcoin halving speculation.\n\n10. #Seth Super ETH Layer1: The Seth AI mobile blockchain launches as a sovereign L1 for the mobile era.
