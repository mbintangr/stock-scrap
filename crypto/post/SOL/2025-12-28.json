The downside over the last three months has stabilized near the 62% Fibonacci retracement of the Dec 2021 low – Jan 2025 high range (monthly chart), coinciding with the center of the March–April 2025 order block zone.  Scenario: If price confirms above 146, a move toward 185.86 (50% Fibonacci of the last downswing) is possible. From there, price is expected to consolidate within the range between the 2022 and 2025 opens, or extend slightly higher toward the 38% Fibonacci level at 201, forming a classical head and shoulders pattern, before a reversal and renewed decline below the 2024 open. #SOL  #Solana","gravity_id":"372349879","id":53591,"createdAt":"2025-12-28T09:30:53.359Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T10:30:19.194Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-28T09:37:45.078Z","text_content":"TON is already showing strong signals of becoming the next major outperformer among top-30 coins.
