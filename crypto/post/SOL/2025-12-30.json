The Missing \"Feedback Loop\"\n​The Bitcoin Power Law relies on a \"triple loop\" that most meme coins lack:\n​Mining & Security: Higher prices lead to more mining hardware, which increases network security. This security attracts more users. Meme coins are typically just tokens on another network (like Ethereum or Solana) and don't have this unique, self-reinforcing security loop.  \n​Difficulty Adjustment: Bitcoin has a built-in \"thermostat\" that adjusts how hard it is to mine. This creates the specific iterative process (output becoming input) required for a true power law to form.  \n​2. Time vs. Hype\n​Bitcoin (The Slow Burn): Bitcoin's power law is a function of time (specifically, days since the Genesis block). It represents a steady, 15-year growth in adoption.  \n​Meme Coins (The Short Life): Meme coins usually rely on viral social media sentiment and \"hype cycles\". Because they often have short lifespans, they don't stay relevant long enough to establish a decades-long power law trend.  \n​3. Utility and the \"City\" Analogy\n​Astrophysicist Giovanni Santostasi, the creator of the theory, compares Bitcoin to a growing city.  \n​Bitcoin behaves like a city where GDP and innovation grow as more people move in.  \n​Meme Coins are often described as collectibles rather than utility-driven networks. Collectibles can have price bubbles, but they don't usually scale mathematically with population size the way a fundamental network does.\nSorry to discredit the pump and dump schemes but they simply \"do not work.\"","gravity_id":"372394903","id":56380,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T21:40:20.604Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T00:30:22.128Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-29T22:22:45.051Z","text_content":"As 2025 comes to a close, the $PANDU community is primed to dominate 2026 like never before! \n\nIn just ~4 months since our explosive Solana launch, we've smashed milestone after milestone—proving Pandu is more than a memecoin, it's your ultimate AI companion on the blockchain:\n\n✅️Launched on Solana with rapid, organic community growth   \n\n✅️Secured listings on CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and major trackers   \n\n✅️Landed CEX trading on MEXC + additional exchanges   \n\n✅️Rolled out the Pandu AI Friend app—now live on Google Play and Solana Mobile   \n\n✅️Minted exclusive Pandu Pandas NFTs with built-in staking rewards   \n\n✅️Dropped our first merch drop: adorable $PANDU plushies!\n\nThis is just the beginning. \n\nWith AI evolution, more utilities, and unbreakable panda energy, the brightest days are ahead.\n\nWho's ready to roar into 2026 with $PANDU?

Token Terminal compared the current phase to stablecoins circa 2020, before that market exploded to its present $300 billion scale.   The comparison highlights how early the #tokenized  stock sector remains despite rapid recent growth. Other observers draw parallels to the 2020 #DeFi  boom, suggesting global equities could increasingly migrate on-chain to capture benefits like continuous trading and fractional ownership.   September's acceleration coincided with Backed Finance deploying its xStocks suite on $ETH , launching roughly 60 tokenized equities through distribution deals with Kraken and Bybit. The institutional partnerships marked a shift from experimental pilots to production-scale deployment.   Securitize announced plans earlier in December to enable compliant on-chain trading of public equities with direct share ownership. Ondo Finance is preparing to release tokenized U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds on $SOL  during early 2026.   Coinbase revealed intentions to add stock trading as part of a broader push to become a comprehensive financial platform. The expansion moves beyond crypto-native products into delivering traditional securities through blockchain infrastructure.   #Nasdaq  provided perhaps the strongest institutional validation by filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer tokenized stocks on its platform. Matt Savarese, the exchange's head of digital assets strategy, called #tokenization  a top organizational priority.   Savarese told #CNBC  that Nasdaq aims to integrate blockchain technology without disrupting existing market infrastructure. The exchange wants traditional participants to adopt tokenization gradually rather than forcing a complete system overhaul.","gravity_id":"372402629","id":56615,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T03:00:25.177Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T04:00:29.042Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-30T03:01:45.074Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nDelphi Ventures Partner: $BTC and $SOL Expected to Reach All-Time Highs in 2026\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372404124","id":56624,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T03:10:06.120Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T04:40:22.131Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-30T03:01:45.068Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\nDelphi Ventures Partner: Expects $BTC and $SOL to Both Hit New All-Time Highs in 2026\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372404122","id":56626,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T03:10:06.834Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T04:40:22.280Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-30T03:01:45.051Z","text_content":"#BREAKING \n\n\"「100% Win Rate」 trader enters long position on $SOL, with an average entry price of $123.23\"\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC","gravity_id":"372403194","id":56629,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T03:10:22.282Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T04:40:22.424Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-30T03:37:45.036Z","text_content":"$ETH & $SOL Staking Gala is live! \n\nEarn up to 20% APR by staking ETH & SOL on MEXC.\n\n👉 Explore: https://www.mexc.com/staking?financialId=2003738198890934272&currencyId=93c38b0169214f8689763ce9a63a73ff&currencyName=ETH&utm_source=socialmedia&utm_medium=twitter ","gravity_id":"372403520","id":56643,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T03:40:03.513Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T05:00:21.859Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-30T04:25:49.484Z","text_content":"RWA DATA\n\n\nToken Terminal data shows the tokenized stocks market reaching a new all-time high market cap of $1.2B.\n\n\nThe milestone highlights continued progress in bringing traditional equities on-chain.\n\n\n$SOL","gravity_id":"372403904","id":56692,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T04:40:20.957Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T05:40:21.195Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-30T04:00:11.699Z","text_content":"$SOL is showing an early momentum shift on the lower timeframe after a sharp sell-off.

After the sharp push toward ~$130, price pulled back and entered consolidation. Market structure remains range-bound, with no technical breakdown. Translation: the market caught its breath — it didn’t jump off a cliff.  🧠 Open Interest — the quiet but powerful signal Open Interest is down about -6% (24h) while price declined modestly.  Why OI matters: 👉 It shows that positions and leverage are exiting the market, not that new shorts are aggressively entering. 👉 Price is moved by leverage and positioning, not ETFs, influencers, or narratives. When OI drops without a breakdown, the market is de-risking, not dumping.  🔥 Funding & Positioning Funding rates are flat to slightly negative, with no extremes. Long/Short ratios remain elevated on accounts, but position size is shrinking. Classic behavior: bullish bias, smaller bets.  💥 Liquidations — no panic flush Liquidations remain contained, with no cascade events. This was not forced selling — it was orderly risk reduction.  🧱 Volume — cooling, not screaming Volume declined alongside price. No spike that would suggest heavy distribution or panic selling. The crowd isn’t running — it’s just stepping aside.  🧊 ETF context (calm down, not a price trigger) Yes, Solana shows the strongest relative preference among BTC / ETH / SOL ETF candidates.

It's manual, error-prone, and chain-specific. NEAR Intents changes that to an outcome-focused model. You declare what you want (e.g., \"Swap 100 USDT on Ethereum to BTC on Bitcoin\"), and the system figures out the rest.\n🧵 2/7 This \"Intent\" paradigm is powered by declarative constraints. Users broadcast their goals via signed messages or natural language/APIs. Then, a network of solvers (market makers) competes to find the best execution path – aggregating liquidity from on-chain and off-chain sources, routing across chains, and settling everything on NEAR's fast  infrastructure.\n🧵 3/7 How does this redefine user interaction with digital assets? No more juggling wallets, gas fees on multiple networks, or risky bridges. It's seamless multichain access: trade 120+ assets across 25+ chains like @Solana, Ethereum, Starknet, and even privacy-focused ones like @Zcash – all in one click, with 2-3 second finality and protection from MEV.\n🧵 4/7 Built on NEAR's Chain Signatures (using MPC for secure cross-chain control) and rapid block times (600ms blocks, 1.2s finality), Intents make assets feel chain-agnostic. For everyday users, it's like using a credit card – instant, intuitive. For devs, it's native multichain logic baked into every contract, unlocking composability without custom hacks.\n🧵 5/7 Now, the exciting part: laying the groundwork for agentic payment rails. NEAR Intents is designed for AI agents to act as market participants. Agents can express intents autonomously – like paying for API usage, rebalancing portfolios, or executing trades based on data feeds – all settled on-chain without human intervention.\n🧵 6/7 Think recurring cross-chain payments, intent-based RWA yields, or AI-optimized hedge funds. It's enabling pay-as-you-go models for AI services, sensor data, or even EV charging. As AI integrates deeper into finance, NEAR becomes the OS for agentic commerce, where money moves intelligently and globally.\n@near_intents @ilblackdragon @solana 🧵 7/7 In short, NEAR Intents isn't just a feature – it's a blueprint for the future of Web3 and AI-driven economies. With $8B+ in volume and hundreds of thousands of unique users already, it's proving real-world traction.","gravity_id":"372414263","id":57135,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T11:40:26.911Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T12:00:29.143Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-30T11:43:45.038Z","text_content":"Solana Token Swap Interface!\n\nDeFi Jupiter is a Solana-based swap interface available on Agent Forge.\n\nIt connects to Jupiter’s liquidity aggregation infrastructure to display swap routes, quotes, and transaction parameters across supported tokens.
