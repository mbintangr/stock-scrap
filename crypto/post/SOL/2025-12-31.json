Without reclaiming execution-layer relevance, ETH risks being squeezed between BTC’s monetary dominance and L2 application gravity.\n\nAt the same time, yield-bearing stablecoins are redefining capital efficiency. In a high-rate world, non-yielding dollars look increasingly obsolete—but synthetic models introduce new systemic risks beneath the surface.\n\n#Crypto #ETH #BTC\nSTABLECOINS, SKEPTICISM, AND WHY RESEARCH IS NOT A TRADE\n\nMessari argues yield-bearing stablecoins may erode USDT’s dominance by redistributing “risk-free” yield to holders. Models like USDe benefit in bull markets but carry depeg risk tied to funding rates and leverage demand—yield is cyclical, not guaranteed.\n\nHistorically, Messari’s calls have been directionally right (SOL, stablecoins, parts of DePIN), but timing and returns vary. Institutional research shapes narratives, not outcomes.\n\nBottom line: these theses highlight where value leaks and power shifts—not a playbook, but a warning system.\nRead More👉https://www.coinrank.io/market/messaris-2026-crypto-theses-power-struggles-stablecoins-and-skepticism-part-2/","gravity_id":"372438612","id":58805,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T10:00:23.888Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T10:50:23.134Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-31T09:53:54.604Z","text_content":"$SOL 🤑 Solana bullish below support or additional crash-low?\n\n#Solana #SOL #SOLUSDT\n\nIt is red until it is red no more.

Our token ran to an 8M market cap, and we launched one product that truly gained traction: Burn & Claim.\n\nIn 2025, we worked really hard on making Burn & Claim the best place to clean up your wallet. We also focused a lot on shaping our brand with the help of @holasoymolly. Along the way, we made a ton of friends at events like Solana Accelerate and mtnDAO, grew our user base to thousands of monthly users, and became profitable. We learned a lot about what it takes to build a product, and we want to expand into other products while applying the same recipe we learned with Burn & Claim.\n\nIn 2026, we will continue to work hard on achieving success as a company, and our ultimate goal is to be able to share that success with our holders who have believed in our team and supported us throughout.\n\nHappy New Year to all of our ComRODs 🥂🎉🎊","gravity_id":"372443575","id":59360,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T15:20:21.909Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T15:50:23.577Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2025-12-31T15:21:00.058Z","text_content":"$SOL is attempting a rebound after a prolonged downtrend, with price stabilizing inside a consolidation range on the 4H chart.
