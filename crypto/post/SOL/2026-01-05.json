After a clean impulsive move upward, the market is now showing signs of exhaustion at the top, with sellers stepping in and price failing to sustain above the supply area. This rejection from resistance suggests that bullish momentum is weakening, and the market is preparing for a corrective move toward lower liquidity zones.\n\n\nFrom a short-trade perspective, this setup favors continuation to the downside as long as price remains below the resistance band. The structure indicates a classic pullback after an overextended push, targeting the nearest demand zones below.

Speaking with the Jupiter Exchange team, Yakovenko suggested storing profits as claimable protocol assets for long-term stakers. By locking tokens for a year, stakers would earn yield as the protocol’s balance sheet grows, rewarding long-term commitment while discouraging short-term flipping.   \r \r \r This proposal comes after concerns were raised about the $70 million token buybacks by Jupiter Exchange, which showed limited long-term impact. The idea is that staking rather than buybacks can create more durable value for the ecosystem.\r \r \r Yakovenko's model aligns with traditional finance's long-term investment principles, encouraging growth incentives and attracting loyal participants.

After weeks of choppy price action, the technical structure is finally shifting back to a bullish bias.  Technical Highlights:  Support Flip: The $130–$132 zone is now acting as solid short-term support, confirming that buyers are stepping in with conviction.  Momentum Shift: Price is currently holding above key moving averages, signaling that the recent downtrend is losing steam.  The Resistance Wall: All eyes are now on the $138–$140 zone. Turning this area into support will be the key to unlocking targets toward $150+.  The Bottom Line: While the momentum is improving, the trend’s sustainability depends on volume at these higher levels. We are no longer just \"bouncing\"; we are building.
