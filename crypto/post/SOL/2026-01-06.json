This design increases scalability by using offchain execution, while preserving Ethereum-grade security via onchain proof verification.\n\nVitalik characterizes contemporary zkEVMs as “alpha stage,” claiming they enjoy production-quality performance, but require safety work. He expects their full benefits to emerge over the next 4 years, with the first opportunities to run zkEVM nodes occurring sometime in the new year.\n\n📡 What is PeerDAS?\n\nPeer-to-Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS) is Ethereum’s latest leap in data scaling. It was adopted to mainnet on December 3, 2025, and served as the headline improvement of Ethereum’s recent Fusaka upgrade.\n\nRollups need to publish transaction data to Ethereum so the network can independently verify state transitions, and PeerDAS dramatically reduces the cost of making this data available by allowing nodes to sample small pieces of data from peers, rather than downloading entire data blobs.\n\nPeerDAS (live today on mainnet) allowed Ethereum to increase the dedicated “blob” storage space for data availability with no changes to the hardware requirements for nodes that want to validate the Ethereum L1.\n\n🧭 Where to Next?\n\nOver the next four years, Vitalik believes that Ethereum can become the first network to fully conquer the blockchain trilemma. Such a breakthrough is not anticipated to be the outcome of a single sudden achievement; rather it is expected to be the gradual result of sustained progress over time.\n\nEthereum has already expanded data availability through PeerDAS, and while developers expect initial zkEVM node experiments to begin this year, Buterin doesn’t anticipate zkEVMs will become a dominant method of block validation until later this decade.\n\nAlthough execution risk remains, should Vitalik’s scaling vision materialize, Ethereum could very well redefine what’s possible for decentralized systems, offering a model where security, decentralization, and scalability reinforce one another instead of competing.","gravity_id":"372593541","id":68904,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T22:40:02.827Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T00:00:28.121Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-05T22:36:41.568Z","text_content":"APEMARS: The Next Big Crypto Opportunity\n\nAPEMARS (#APRZ), a mission-driven meme coin, is set to launch its presale on January 6, 2026, with Stage 1 priced at $0.00001699, offering a potential 32,271% ROI if the projected listing price of $0.0055 holds.

This type of price behavior often suggests healthier market participation.\n\n\nFrom a structure perspective, SOL has reclaimed an important mid-range level that previously acted as resistance during the downtrend. Holding above this area strengthens the bullish case and shifts market bias toward continuation rather than rejection. Any short-term pullbacks into prior demand zones may be viewed as retests rather than trend failure, as long as price maintains higher-low structure.\n\nOverall, Solana appears to be building a foundation for a broader upside move.

No, this is not “sell the house, call the bank” green. Looks like liquidity doing its job — not a headline pump.  📊 Market feel Active exchanges, steady spot participation. No panic volume. No euphoric volume. Translation: nobody is running for the exits, and nobody is running to the notary either.  📈 Open Interest (~$8.3B) Rising with price, not ahead of it. That’s important. When OI outruns price, leverage gets loud. Here, leverage is… well-behaved. Almost suspiciously calm.  🧭 Price action SOL is stepping higher, not teleporting. Higher lows, pauses, continuation. That’s how trends walk. Pumps prefer sprinting — and tripping. ⚖️ Long / Short corner (where emotions usually break) Long ratios ~2.3–2.7 across majors. Confident? Yes. Manic? Not yet. If this were peak FOMO, funding would be screaming and your group chat would be typing in CAPS.  💥 Liquidations Shorts first, longs mostly untouched. That’s trend behavior. Tops usually start by eating longs for breakfast.  😌 Coffee-table reminder If you suddenly feel the urge to go all-in because everything is green — that’s not a signal. That’s caffeine + recency bias talking.  (or, in simpler terms ☕🙂 If price makes you want to sell your apartment to buy crypto… it’s probably not the moment.) 🧠 What environments like this usually lead to Continuation in waves, not straight lines. Pauses instead of sharp reversals. Selective rotation, not “everything goes vertical”.  🔚 Final sip Green days are great. Green brains are expensive. We’re not chasing the train while it’s already accelerating — we were boarding quietly back in December. Now we just watch the track and decide where the stops are.","gravity_id":"372604531","id":69640,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T08:22:39.248Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T09:20:26.989Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-06T08:28:45.056Z","text_content":"💰 Bitcoin ETF inflows hit $697M on Jan. 5, led by BlackRock’s $372M surge!

This marked a 21% increase in financial damage compared to the previous year.\nOur latest report, \"Exploited Ledgers: The Web3 Hack Report 2025,\" provides a comprehensive breakdown of a volatile year for the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nWhile total losses rose by 21% compared to 2024, the data reveals a significant shift in how threats are manifesting and how we can mitigate them.\nKey Findings from the Report:\n\n1⃣ Concentrated Volatility:\n\n63% of the year's total financial damage occurred in Q1, with February alone recording $1.5B in losses.\n\n2⃣ The Human Factor:\n\nPhishing and private key compromises remain critical, with just three major phishing cases causing over $1.4B in damages.\n\n3⃣ Network Impact:\n\n@ethereum continues to face the highest volume of exploits, followed by @SuiNetwork and @solana.\nTo counter these evolving threats, we propose the integration of AI-powered audit agents like QuillShield. These tools are transforming traditional auditing by reducing vulnerability detection times from weeks to under 5 minutes with 90% accuracy. \nAs we look toward 2026, a layered defense strategy of combining hardware wallets, multi-factor authentication, and AI-driven DevSecOps is no longer optional but rather essential. \n👉 Download the full 2025 Web3 Hack Report for deep insights and strategic recommendations for your protocol:\n\nhttps://www.quillaudits.com/reports/exploited-ledgers-web3-2025-hack-report","gravity_id":"372609762","id":69949,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T13:10:30.030Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T13:10:30.030Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-06T12:49:45.053Z","text_content":"Solana ETFs Market Tops $1B, Led by Bitwise’s $732M BSOL Fund\n\nhttps://deythere.com/solana-etfs-market-tops-1b-led-by-bitwises-732m-bsol-fund/\n\n#Bitwise #BlockchainFinance #cryptoETFs #DigitalAssets #institutionalcrypto #SolanaETFs #Solanastaking #Crypto #Market #News ","gravity_id":"372609761","id":69950,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T13:10:30.476Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T13:10:30.476Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-06T12:48:13.598Z","text_content":"NVDA lost $460B in a few months.

But the rally was short-lived, with the price pulling back to around $1.85 shortly after. Interestingly, this move happened without strong social momentum. Data shows that discussion around SUI collapsed by nearly 95% even as the price recovered. In other words, the price was rising quietly, while crowd attention stayed low.  Takeaway: Price action can move ahead of social hype but limited crowd interest might mean rallies aren’t fully supported yet. Keep an eye on key levels and momentum for the next moves.
