The Ledger breach underscores the unchanging truth: control is earned, not given, and information, once exposed, is forever vulnerable.  The latest Ledger data breach, exposing customer details, highlights the ongoing risks in crypto. While the focus is on phishing attempts and potential physical targeting, the core issue is the consistent failure of centralized systems to secure user data. In this landscape, users must assume that data leaks are inevitable. The experts urge for privacy. They recommend verifying senders, avoiding unsolicited communications, and prioritizing anonymity.

After a clean bounce from the demand area near 132–134, $SOL has maintained higher lows and is now building strength above 138–139. This kind of consolidation after an impulsive move usually signals continuation, especially when price respects the mid-range and doesn’t give sellers much room to push it down.\n\n\nFrom a long trade perspective, the structure remains bullish as long as price holds above the recent higher low. The market has already absorbed selling pressure, and momentum is slowly shifting back to the upside. A sustained move above the local resistance can open the path toward the 145 zone, which aligns with the next major liquidity and resistance level. This makes long positions favorable on dips, with risk clearly defined below support.\nFor a short trade, there is no clear confirmation yet.\n\n\nShorts only become valid if price fails to hold above the current range and breaks back below the 136–134 support area. Until that happens, selling into strength would be risky, as the overall structure still favors upside continuation rather than reversal.\nShort outlook: Bias remains bullish toward 145 as long as price stays above the key support zone; weakness only starts if the structure breaks below support.","gravity_id":"372641020","id":71618,"createdAt":"2026-01-07T09:02:43.760Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-07T09:10:27.142Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-07T08:46:33.171Z","text_content":"The meme coin sector just saw a staggering $3B inflow, underscoring speculative appetite.

Structure holds. Liquidity rotates. No need to chase green candles before coffee.  📊 What the data actually says • Price: ~$139 • 24h change: ~+1.2% • 7D: ~+11% • Market Cap: ~$78.5B • Spot + Futures volume: elevated, but not explosive  Why it looks like this: After a double-digit weekly move, markets usually pause to lock in gains. That often shows up as steady price, rotating liquidity, and volume that cools without collapsing.  This is not a vertical move — it’s digestion after a strong leg up.  🔄 Derivatives & positioning (the quiet part) • Long/Short ratio: still long-heavy (≈2.5–3.0 on majors) • Open Interest: stable to slightly up — no aggressive leverage expansion • Funding: neutral to mildly negative on some venues  That combination usually points to controlled profit-taking, not trend exhaustion.  🧹 Liquidations tell the story • Shorts still getting clipped on pushes • Long liquidations remain selective, not cascading  Tops usually start by feeding on longs. Today’s market is still nibbling on shorts.  😌 The human part (soft humor, not in your face)  Green days are nice. Green mornings are dangerous if you forget why you bought in the first place.  Some positions were built in December. Some profits were taken today. Both can be true at the same time.  ☕ Closing thought If price needs you to hurry — it probably isn’t in a hurry itself.
