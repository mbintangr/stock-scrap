Price is currently around $136.06, under the midpoint of the recent swing range, with most momentum indicators pointing lower. Still, a few oscillators are hinting at possible short-term volatility or a relief bounce.  Key levels to watch • Resistance: $136.56, then the $137.88–138.33 zone (imbalance and equilibrium). Higher resistance sits at $141.27–$143.48. • Support: $133.18 is the key swing low and main liquidity level. Below that, downside levels are $130.16 and $124.15 if bearish momentum accelerates.  Outlook and trade logic The trend remains bearish unless SOL shows a strong reversal near $133.18. A sweep below that level followed by bullish candles could open a bounce back toward $136.56 and $138.33. Rejections near $137.88 or higher favor short setups targeting $133.18 and below.

Yes, it’s red. But red alone isn’t a diagnosis — what matters is how we got here and what’s missing.  📊 Open Interest: around $8.25B (–1.3%). Leverage is being reduced smoothly, without a price collapse. If this were a real top, OI would be dropping after panic. Here, we’re seeing unloading — not an exit.  🔁 Futures Volume (24h): roughly $14B (–28%). Lower volume = fewer emotions. Real trends don’t need noise — they prepare quietly.  ⚖️ Long / Short (24h): approximately 0.96–0.97. No overcrowded side, no “all-in” behavior. This isn’t euphoria — it’s balance.  💸 Funding rate: close to 0.01%. The market isn’t paying anyone to stay long. When funding is calm, moves usually come later, not immediately.  💥 Liquidations (24h): about $18.7M, mostly longs (~$17.3M). A classic post-impulse cleanup — impatient hands pay first. That’s trend behavior, not an alarm siren.  📈 Structure (4H): pullback from the $140–145 zone, holding above $130–133, RSI ~47–50. Cooling, not breaking. Many altcoins show the same — tight ranges and bull-flag-like formations.  📰 Headlines: once again rotate around “altseason,” “weak market,” “top or start.” History shows meaningful moves rarely begin when everyone is talking about them.  📚 Learning moment: real rallies don’t start with applause. They start when most people are tired of waiting and have lost interest.  😏 Quick reality check: No, this wasn’t the top. Yes, someone panic-sold the bottom — again. And yes, Twitter already “called it” twice today.  🧠 Takeaway: this isn’t a day for hero trades. Light profit-taking is healthy, patience is an underrated asset, and rushed decisions usually come with a fee.  ☕ Final note: fear always rushes.
