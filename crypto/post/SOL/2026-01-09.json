Not a single so-called Web3 social network has managed to take root or attract a real user base! I've tried a ton of them, and every time it boils down to the same thing: funneling traffic from Web2 into the platform, only to find a feed that's basically a desert. The recommendation algorithms don't work at all! The timeline is flooded with random posts from semi-bots. Projects raised money in seed rounds, rolled out some app, but inside it's empty!  Every social network is, above all, about people!   99% of current SocialFI is just a thinly veiled Ponzi scheme.   The playbook is straightforward: \"sign up → invite friends → farm points → wait for token → dump on everyone.\" Friend. tech, Farcaster apps, a bunch of mini-apps on $SOL  /Base — it's all the same crap with different wrapping.  People only register to farm points!  Monetizing attention only works when there's genuine scarcity.   As long as creators can post for free on X, TikTok, YouTube and get 100× the reach, why on earth would they migrate to a blockchain platform with an audience thousands of times smaller?  A real breakthrough is only possible in two scenarios:  - When a major traditional player (X, Telegram, Reddit) natively integrates on-chain monetization. And that's probably exactly what will happen! The time will come when Instagram or YouTube simply launches their own chain, their own token, and their own creator reward system!  SocialFI has also devolved into scam-like messenger launches like BBL!   Just like prediction markets, the niche is now packed with platforms where users are forced (not because they want to, but because they have to) to post content about the project that's paying a marketing budget to promote itself. Creators churn out posts, farm points, and climb leaderboards! But it looks absolutely awful! In other words, the entire SocialFI ecosystem is built on fake, manufactured activity!","gravity_id":"372687050","id":74790,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T19:10:34.310Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T19:10:34.310Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-08T19:16:45.120Z","text_content":"In a landmark development for financial markets, Morgan Stanley is poised to enable direct trading of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) for clients of its online brokerage giant, E*Trade, within the first half of this year.\nhttps://bitcoinworld.co.in/morgan-stanley-crypto-trading-etrade/ ","gravity_id":"372687287","id":74796,"createdAt":"2026-01-08T19:20:04.082Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-08T19:50:30.282Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-08T19:19:45.028Z","text_content":"According to Barron’s, Morgan Stanley is advancing a strategy spanning digital assets, wealth management, and private markets.

Holding above the 50-day EMA now suggests short-term momentum is improving. The next critical level is around $149, aligning with the 100-day EMA and prior resistance zones.  Analysts view this as a decisive point: if $SOL   maintains above $149, it could target the $250–$253 range, representing roughly 84% upside from current levels.  On-chain activity supports this outlook. Stablecoin supply on Solana has grown by over $900 million, and daily trading volume on Pumpfun exceeded $2 billion, indicating strong user engagement even as short-term speculative activity slows.  Currently, SOL’s price is supported by long-term holders, cautious large traders, and increasing on-chain usage. Price action around $149 will be pivotal in determining whether the uptrend continues.

Stacking BGB while trading trending assets like SOL feels like a smart way to build long-term value in a shifting market. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #SOL","gravity_id":"372697942","id":75637,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T07:40:08.138Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T07:50:30.869Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-09T07:37:57.663Z","text_content":"🔔📈 NOW: Solana $SOL Reclaims $140 Trading +3.55% The Past 24hrs.","gravity_id":"372697980","id":75645,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T07:40:29.013Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T08:10:31.305Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-09T07:37:45.115Z","text_content":"ONDO x SOLANA: THE EXPANSION\n\n$SOL is becoming the \"Internet Capital Market\" thanks to $ONDO\n\n$ONDO’s expansion into the $SOL ecosystem is a game-changer. \n\nBy bringing $400M+ in tokenized stocks and ETFs to a high-speed rail, they are proving that 24/7 global stock trading is finally here. \n\nIf you aren't watching the ONDO/SOL pair, you're missing the future of equity.","gravity_id":"372697977","id":75646,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T07:40:29.247Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T07:50:30.637Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-09T07:33:19.082Z","text_content":"🚨  JUST IN:    SOLANA HAS SURPASSED ETHEREUM IN 24HR PERPS TRADING VOLUME!  #SOLANA  ⚡️ $SOL","gravity_id":"372697940","id":75647,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T07:40:29.711Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T07:40:29.711Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-09T07:43:45.043Z","text_content":"💸 On Jan 8, SOL & XRP spot ETFs saw inflows, while BTC & ETH ETFs faced outflows.

I am a bit nervous yet excited at the same time. I would like to ask: Should I sell or continue holding?\n\nA: That's an easy question my dear reader, it will be my pleasure to answer. Hold, wait for higher prices before taking profits.\n\nTechnical analysis\n\nSolana hit bottom 18-December and has been growing since. The action is happening safely above \"support zone.\" Light blue-space on the chart.\n\nSOLUSDT peaked at $143 and produced one single red candle, yesterday. Today started red but not anymore. The low was $132 and yet, the day is set to close with a strong green candle. Hold for sure.\n\nThere is a Fib. level at $137, the 0.148 extension. Notice how prices went above and below this level. No real retrace, no pauses—is as good as it gets.\n\nSolana is aiming first at a target of $200 in the coming days, definitely this same month. The next target, and higher, sits at $255, can be $250, followed by $333.\n\nThe first target at $200 is a high probability target, this is the minimum we are aiming for. The last high is also good to consider but we have to see how the bullish wave unravels, will there be enough force?\n\nIn just a matter of weeks we will know if a higher high is possible for Solana. So far, it is still too early to say.\n\nWhen it comes to the next move, a bearish move right now has 0-1% probability, while a bullish move is almost at 100%; 99% probability the market is moving higher. You can easily continue to hold. Here you can find more trades.\n\nThanks a lot for your continued support. It is truly appreciated.\nIf you enjoy the content, consider using a portion of your profits to join us.\n\nNamaste.","gravity_id":"372699009","id":75668,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T07:50:29.755Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T08:40:31.232Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-09T07:40:57.131Z","text_content":"$SOL Gm!

Since early 2026, sentiment has improved on rising institutional engagement (including ETF-related filings), steady protocol upgrades, and expanding DeFi and tokenisation activity. These fundamentals support a constructive long-term thesis - but price action still needs confirmation.  Technically, $145–$150 has flipped into a clear supply zone. After the 2025 highs, repeated rejections below $150 signal active distribution. Until SOL reclaims and holds above $145, upside remains capped.  Price has compressed into a multi-month range. Demand is firm at $128–$119, repeatedly absorbing sell pressure, while supply dominates $130–$144. Liquidity is thinning, and CMF shows bearish divergence, warning that buyers have yet to take control.  That said, momentum is improving at the margin. MACD points to waning sell pressure and a potential bullish crossover, while RSI is attempting to recover - suggesting latent upside if volume expands.  This looks like consolidation, not capitulation. A decisive break and close above $145 could unlock $150+. Failure to do so keeps SOL range-bound, with downside protected as long as $119–$128 holds.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372698989","id":75765,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T09:00:29.165Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T10:00:31.715Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-09T08:55:45.161Z","text_content":"Most prediction platforms are built to entertain.\nIndotspace is built to endure.\n\nThat difference shows the moment volume hits.\n\nInstead of treating conviction like a game, @intodotspace is building a high-performance belief exchange on Solana - designed for speed, leverage, and persistent liquidity.\n\n🔹 Up to 10× leverage for real directional expression\n🔹 Zero maker fees that recycle into market depth\n🔹 Liquidity-first architecture that doesn’t thin out\n🔹 Competitive trading seasons that keep markets alive\n\nYou’re not placing bets.\nYou’re deploying belief into liquid rails.\n\nIndotspace turns sentiment into infrastructure - and gives conviction a permanent home onchain.","gravity_id":"372699912","id":75766,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T09:00:29.393Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T09:50:31.175Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-09T09:05:00.066Z","text_content":"$SOL Momentum still strong after pullback.\n\nEntry: 139.0 – 140.0\nSL: 137.8\n\nTP1: 142.0\nTP2: 145.0\nTP3: 150.0\n\nHold above 138 = upside continues.","gravity_id":"372701056","id":75782,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T09:10:29.727Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T10:00:31.483Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-09T09:19:45.090Z","text_content":"📢 KuCoin Alpha has Listed Token: @67coinX\n\n🗓 Trading starts: 2026-01-09 8:00 (UTC)\n🔁 Pair: 67/USDT\n🌐 Network: Solana Chain\n\nDiscover early-stage innovation and start trading in the KuCoin Alpha Zone.\n\nhttps://www.kucoin.com/announcement/en-kucoin-alpha-has-listed-token-official-67-coin-67?utm_source=social_listing_2026_twitter&utm_medium=social_media_post\n\n#KuCoinAlpha ","gravity_id":"372701171","id":75796,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T09:20:29.422Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T10:20:32.052Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-09T09:12:40.511Z","text_content":"🚀 $SOL Stable growth when the market is moving sideways.","gravity_id":"372701122","id":75797,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T09:20:29.661Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T10:10:31.264Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-09T09:10:32.786Z","text_content":"$SOL remains a strong long position.\n\nETFs continue to inflows.\n\n $SOL's upside potential is higher than\n $BTC and #ETH.","gravity_id":"372700109","id":75798,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T09:20:29.891Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T10:00:31.253Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-09T09:28:45.158Z","text_content":"CMC Market Pulse: ICOs, ICOs, Everywhere\n\n BTC +2.36%, ETH +2.92%! $3.11T market cap.

At the start of the week we collected some questions from our community, now it's time to post the answers 👇\n\n@Deril1160445 Asks - \"Will the upcoming 2.0 sequencer support Cairo (Starknet)?\"\n\nAnswer: We'll be looking at integrating any non-EVM chains which have demonstrated sufficient adoption and where we think native developers could benefit most from leveraging Reactive contracts. \n\nWe aren't just limited to non-EVM chains however as we'll be adding the ability to subscribe to off-chain data too! We'll share more as we move closer to our first non-EVM integration.\n\n@cryptodaaddy Asks - \"how does Reactive handle cross-chain communication?\"\n\nAnswer: Reactive enables cross-chain communication by combining our event-driven Reactive contract architecture with decentralized messaging infrastructure (GMPs) allowing smart contracts to react to events on one blockchain and trigger logic on another. Trustlessly, automatically and with no manual intervention!\n\n@Romynft Asks - \"What’s the biggest challenge you’re facing right now?\"\n\nAnswer: While projects across the blockchain space face many challenges currently, Reactive specifically is well positioned to help address some of these problems, especially when faced with a high degree of fragmentation between chains and a greater need for coordination than ever before.\n\nThe challenges we're focusing on right now are to overcome the various technical hurdles needed to take Reactive to the next level, to introduce the foundations needed to begin non-EVM and off-chain data integrations and improvements to our own consensus mechanisms.\n\n@outboxing13 Asks - \"How has testing being going for the Ethereum EIL testnet?\"\n\nAnswer: EIL itself is still in the very early stages so there's not too much to share just yet, however our focus is to ensure we stay up to date with any developments on Ethereum to ensure we can position ourselves best as an infrastructure provider in that ecosystem. \n\n@outboxing13 Asks - \"Will you ever make staking similar to solana where we can leave it staked as long as we want?\"\n\nAnswer: Users are likely to see big changes in many areas related to staking in the future as we restructure our current model, we can't commit to any specifics just yet though.\n\n@Z37350A Asks - \"What happened to shogun? Is this still an ongoing project?\"\n\nAnswer: Certainly, we're still working with their team and will share updates on their RC integration as soon as it's available but we'll have to leave general updates on their project up to their team, we're sure they'd be happy to share more if you contact them directly however.\n\n@ap_2331 Asks - \"Any update on non-EVM integration?\"\n\nAnswer: The first big component needed for non-EVM chains is sequencer 2.0 which is currently one of our development teams top priorities so you'll definitely be hearing more updates from us in the coming year as soon as it's ready to share.\n\nWe hope this answers all of your questions, as usual we'll return next Monday to collect more.
