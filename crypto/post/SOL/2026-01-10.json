Basically, the market is side-eyeing SOL, not running from it.  🔍 Big picture: SOL dipped, bounced, and is now consolidating. If bulls reclaim $140, momentum could wake up again. Lose $130, and we may see a deeper retest. For now, it’s a patience game.  Not a crash. Not a moon. Just SOL doing SOL things 😌 What’s your move here... watching, buying the dip, or waiting for confirmation? ﻿#Solana  #SOL","gravity_id":"372714929","id":77041,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T20:50:30.261Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T21:50:32.798Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-09T21:05:55.115Z","text_content":"I came in a bit nervous after getting chopped up last week, so I kept it simple and traded $EGL1  on $SOL  during Bitget Crazy 48H (Phase 19).   Four clean trades hit 20,000 USDT volume and put me on the board, last phase needed 200k. Now I’m tracking PnL and tightening risk while I defend rank. Who’s pushing for Top 10?  #Macro Insights#  #Meme Alpha#","gravity_id":"372716453","id":77069,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T21:10:30.535Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T22:20:32.255Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-09T21:03:41.606Z","text_content":"$SOL is trading around $135.6 on the 15m timeframe, showing short-term weakness after a clear lower high.\n\nPrice has broken below the intraday structure and is now trending lower, with momentum pointing toward the $133.5–$134.0 demand zone, where buyers previously stepped in.\n\nThis area is a key level to watch for a reaction.
