That means: - Less institutional demand - Fewer whales allocating capital - And very little real demand for Altcoins  This does not mean there will be no Altseason.

We left structure. And the first sessions of the new week confirm it. TL;DR 🌍 Market context (now): Total market cap continues to hold, volatility remains compressed, and reactions to headlines stay muted. BTC isn’t accelerating, but it isn’t breaking either. ETH remains constructive. No panic, no euphoria — just positioning. When markets ignore noise, that is the signal.  📰 Headlines are still loud, but price action is not. That disconnect matters. If fear were real, it would already be visible in volatility, funding, or liquidation clusters. It isn’t.  🧱 Solana (SOL) — current structure check  Price: ~$141–142. SOL opens the week above last week’s range, with higher lows intact and no structural damage. Momentum is controlled, not exhausted.  Open Interest: ~$8.4–8.5B. Elevated but stable, confirming continued participation without aggressive leverage expansion. No signs of crowded positioning.  Funding Rate: Hovering near neutral, with brief negative dips. These resets are maintenance, not weakness. Leverage stays disciplined.  Liquidations: Balanced on both sides. No cascades, no directional stress. The market is not forcing exits.  Volume: Futures ~$14–15B (24h), spot ~$1.2B. Active enough to matter, quiet enough to stay healthy.  🔍 Current read: SOL is not chasing. It’s being built.  🧩 This is the phase where overreaction costs the most. Not because moves are big — but because they’re not. Markets punish impatience during quiet weeks, not during volatile ones.  ⏳ False starts feel urgent. Real continuations feel boring. If this feels slow, good. If it feels underwhelming, even better. That’s usually how sustainable moves begin.  ☕ Closing thought: New week, new headlines — same game. If this market wanted you out, it wouldn’t whisper. It would already be loud. Until then, structure stays. Positions stay. And patience keeps doing what noise can’t","gravity_id":"372769760","id":80852,"createdAt":"2026-01-12T07:30:31.493Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T07:50:32.866Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-12T07:33:00.044Z","text_content":"$SOL  is gaining traction with impressive price action and strong ecosystem activity.

In less than a week, Solana bounced from sub-$135 and is now knocking on the $145 resistance for the 6th time since Nov 2025. Historically, this zone triggered brutal 15–16% pullbacks. This time? Only a shallow 3–4% dip before buyers stepped back in. That’s real bullish resilience 👀  Technically, SOL looks strong: • Trading above all major MAs • RSI holding high since early 2026 • Possible double-bottom breakout forming  But here’s the catch ⚠️ Network growth is slowing hard. New wallet creation dropped from ~30M (Nov 2024) to ~7M. Previous SOL rallies were fueled by fresh users — without that, breakouts can fail.  My take: 👉 A clean, high-volume close above $145 = path toward $150–$180 👉 Weak volume + fading adoption = rejection & short-term pullback  $200 in 2026?

If you only look at the price, you’re missing the red flags on-chain. According to the latest Santiment data, Solana’s network growth is in a freefall. In November 2024, the network was pumping out 30.2 million new wallets a week. Now? We’re struggling to hit 7.3 million.  Sellers are defending $145 like it’s the Alamo. Until we see a daily close above this level with real volume, every pump is just exit liquidity for the whales. As long as we hold $135, there’s no need to panic. But if the \"on-chain ghost town\" continues, a visit to $120 or even $116 is much more likely than a trip to $200.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#  #SOL   WhiteBIT Chart (5d): $SOL","gravity_id":"372781997","id":81994,"createdAt":"2026-01-12T17:40:31.849Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T17:50:32.957Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-12T17:36:53.082Z","text_content":"📊 Solana at a Key Decision Zone\n\n $SOL recovered from below $135 and is retesting the $141–$145 resistance, a level that previously caused 15–16% pullbacks.
