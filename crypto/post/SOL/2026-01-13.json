The market is testing whether $130–135 holds as a higher-low zone.  ⏱️ 4H — the engine 📊 4H structure: Price trading above EMA20 & EMA50 EMA20/50 aligned to the upside EMA100 (~$134) acting as dynamic support RSI ≈ 55–57 → neutral-bullish 🔥 Micro-structure: Higher lows, shallow pullbacks, no aggressive sell pressure. 🔥 Derivatives (CoinGlass) 📊 Data points: Open Interest ≈ $8.4B, slightly down Funding remains low / controlled Longs dominate, but not extreme Liquidations are two-sided, no cascade 🧠 Takeaway: Leverage is cooling, not stacking — supportive for sustainable upside.  🎓 What would actually lift SOL We need: ✅ Daily close above EMA50 (~$149) ✅ EMA20 leading price ✅ RSI holding 55–65, not 75+ ✅ Open Interest rising with price We don’t need: ❌ Hype headlines ❌ Funding spikes ❌ Vertical 4H candles without base  ⚖️ What matters vs what doesn’t Matters: Liquidity, BTC stability, structural reclaim, derivatives cooldown.
