Historically, each test triggered 15–16% pullbacks. This time, however, the correction has been limited to just 3–4%, hinting at improving buyer resilience.  \r \r \r From a technical standpoint, the structure looks constructive. SOL is trading above its 20, 50, 100, and 200 moving averages, a configuration not seen since September 2025. On lower timeframes, price is testing the neckline of a potential double-bottom formation, while RSI remains elevated, suggesting sustained momentum rather than exhaustion.  \r \r \r That said, on-chain data introduces caution. Network growth has slowed meaningfully: weekly new wallet creation has dropped from ~30M at its peak to ~7M recently. Previous $SOL  rallies were closely tied to expanding user participation, and without a rebound in network activity, upside attempts near $145 risk losing follow-through.  \r \r \r A high-volume daily close above $145 would mark a structural shift and open the path toward $165–$180. Failure to break could keep SOL locked in a broader range, with deeper pullbacks still on the table.

It’s built for clarity, scale, and readability across the tiny icons you see on CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and your favorite wallet, while staying true to the RODAI character you know.\nRODAI started in early 2024 with an AI-generated logo, and we immediately connected with the character. It had personality and quickly became part of the project’s identity.\nAs RODAI grew, we tried to push that original image further. We explored turning the character into NFTs, using it for merch, and expanding it across more surfaces. We even redrew and rebuilt the AI image as vector artwork so it could scale better.\nBut despite all that effort, it became clear that the original logo wasn’t going to cut it. The quality ceiling was too low, flexibility was limited, and every new use case introduced more constraints.\nThis is where our art director @holasoymolly came in 💜.\n\nWe worked closely with her over several months to define what the RODAI logo should be and what it should not be. At the same time, we made sure it fit perfectly within the graphic universe of @aerosol_xyz and @burnandclaim, so everything feels cohesive across the ecosystem.\nThroughout the process, we also shared early versions with our Telegram community and listened carefully to feedback as we were building.\n\nRODAI has always been community driven, and it was important that this new identity reflected that from the start.\nAnd this is the result.\n\nA logo system that finally gives RODAI the foundation it needs to scale across products, platforms, merch, NFTs, and everything that comes next. \nOur website at http://rodai.meme has also been fully updated to reflect the new look ✨ \nWe hope you love the new RODAI logo as much as we do.\n\nWe’re now ready to start creating merch, NFTs, and much more, and to represent our ComRODs in a way that makes them proud.\n\nThank you for your support these past two years. \n\nThere’s a lot more ahead 🚀✊\nEND OF THREAD 🛑","gravity_id":"372833044","id":85097,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T06:50:31.215Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T07:40:31.483Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-14T06:52:31.655Z","text_content":"1’m bullish o$sol ecosystem sponsored our 🇦🇪 Dubai Future Finance Week #DIFC 2026 (May 11-15), anchoring the #SolanaEconomicZone amid 40K+ global attendees, 10K delegates from 150 nations, 1K investors managing $2T+ AUM, 300+ speakers, and 250 sponsors across 25 verticals.

The morning thesis remains valid and is now confirmed by intraday behavior.\n📉 Earlier today, the market went through a liquidation flush, with shorts taking the larger share. Since then, price has held its ground, without impulsive retracements or downside continuation.\n📊 On the 4H chart, SOL remains above key moving averages (EMA 5/10/30). Pullbacks stay shallow and corrective, with no structural damage or trend failure signals.\n⚖ Derivatives data supports this view. Liquidations were short-side dominant, Open Interest stayed elevated, funding remains positive but controlled, and the long/short taker ratio stabilized near balance.\n🧱 Order book behavior around $146–147 shows absorption rather than rejection. Selling pressure is being met, not chased lower.\n🎯 As long as price holds $142–145, structure stays constructive. A clean reclaim of $150+ with volume opens continuation.
