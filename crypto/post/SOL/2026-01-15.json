Funding normalized, OI stable (~$8.8B), no cascade liquidations. This move is digestion, not distribution. Macro noise (Clarity Act) is being misread — banks aren’t “winning”, the market is just repricing where yield belongs.  📊 Structure & price: SOL rejected the mid-$150s and pulled back into prior acceptance. Daily structure holds above ~$136–138, 4H higher-lows intact. RSI cooled from overbought into neutral — classic pause after expansion, not trend failure.  ⚖ Derivatives & positioning: Open Interest barely dipped while price retraced → leverage wasn’t flushed aggressively. Funding cooled instead of flipping deeply negative. Translation: positioning adjusted, not abandoned.  🌍 Macro context (why the narrative sounds scarier than it is): Clarity Act discussions are being framed as “banks winning”, but the actual pressure is on stablecoin yield products, not on L1 execution chains. The market is separating passive yield stories from active utility networks. That’s not bearish — it’s a filter. Why this matters for SOL: When yield narratives fade, attention rotates back to throughput, activity, and ecosystems that actually move value. SOL doesn’t need a yield promise — it needs usage. And that’s exactly where it competes best.  ☕ Coffee-table dialogue: — “Looks heavy… is this the top?” — “No. This is where weak hands ask questions and strong trends take a breath.”  📌 Takeaway: Not every red candle is a warning. Sometimes it’s the market checking its balance after running uphill. Structure first. Headlines later.","gravity_id":"372863599","id":87255,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T07:50:20.967Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T09:30:22.561Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-15T07:40:45.086Z","text_content":"Solana and Aster Investors Are Rushing Toward APEMARS – The Next 1000x Crypto Stage 3 is Closing Soon\n\nhttps://deythere.com/next-1000x-crypto-alert-after-solana-and-aster-apemars-stage-3-exploding-with-22300-roi-signals/\n\n#apemars #Crypto #SponsoredArticle ","gravity_id":"372863587","id":87256,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T07:50:21.125Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T09:00:23.119Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-15T07:59:41.985Z","text_content":"$SOL   reached the $147 level on Tuesday, where selling pressure is expected to emerge.

Infrastructure upgrades: Progress on the Firedancer validator client improves performance, scalability, and decentralization.  Ecosystem growth: New projects, cross-chain integrations, and developer activity continue to expand Solana’s use cases.  Institutional interest: Validators, funds, and infrastructure players increasingly support the Solana network.

The Key Highlights:  Instant Speed: Alpenglow replaces legacy systems with Votor and Rotor, crashing transaction finality from 12.8 seconds to just 100–150 milliseconds. ⚡  Validator Revolution: The upgrade slash on-chain voting fees by 90%, making it vastly cheaper to run a validator while increasing decentralization. 💸  Unrivaled Activity: Solana handled 1.8 billion transactions in December—more than the top 10 other networks combined. 📊  ETF Surge: #Solana  ETFs have added $90M in inflows this month, bringing the cumulative total to $857M. 💰  Technical Outlook: 📊  SOL is currently testing the $150 psychological resistance.
