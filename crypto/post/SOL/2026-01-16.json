Solana prices have risen 25% from recent lows to their highest level since mid-November. The move goes beyond technology. As focus turns to the Alpenglow upgrade and sustained ETF inflows, Solana's medium-term prognosis improves.  The Alpenglow patch may be Solana's biggest protocol modification since launch. It replaces Proof-of-History and TowerBFT with a new design that boosts speed and efficiency. Solana promises to lower finality from 12.8 seconds to 100 to 150 milliseconds, making it one of the quickest blockchains.  This jump comes from two new parts. Votor allows single-round transaction finalization, whereas Rotor replaces Proof-of-History with a faster model. Notable timing. Nearly 1 billion transactions were handled this month and 1.8 billion in December, more than the following ten networks combined. Active addresses exceeded 67 million, and Solana topped the market in December fees at $18 million.  Institutional interest is rising. Spot Solana ETFs have received nearly $90 million this month, bringing their total inflows to over $857 million. That constant allocation shows demand is building before the upgrade, not afterward due to pricing.  On the chart, $SOL   has rallied from $116 to $144 and is approaching $150 psychologically. Price has turned the 50-day EMA into support and formed a cup-and-handle pattern, which usually signals continuation. If momentum sustains, the next significant target is approaching $200, a psychological and technical barrier region.  The setup is positive if recent support holds. The bullish thesis would be delayed if pivot levels fail, but Solana is harmonizing structure, fundamentals, and participation. Alpenglow is nearing, and the market is pricing in quicker finality and persistent consumption in the coming months.","gravity_id":"372885070","id":88184,"createdAt":"2026-01-15T18:30:22.703Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T19:20:22.792Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-15T18:39:13.807Z","text_content":"Wyoming's State-Backed #Stablecoin  Launches on $SOL , Aiming for Regulatory Clarity and #Blockchain  Efficiency  Wyoming has officially launched its state-managed stablecoin, the Wyoming Frontier $Stable Token, on the #Solana  (#SOL ) blockchain.

However, the majority of users access it via mobile browsers. In a mobile environment, the Mobile Wallet Adapter can be unstable when used with standard browsers like Chrome.\n\nDuring the claim process, users are required to perform multiple actions (such as connecting X), which can unintentionally terminate the wallet connection. This is a known limitation across many Solana dApps.\n\nTo resolve this, we recommended one of the following solutions:\n1. Log out, refresh the page, and log in again\n2. Complete the entire process using a wallet-based browser, such as Phantom, Solflare or Jupiter\n\nWe have already shared these instructions and guides on Discord.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not control the infrastructure of mobile browsers or the Mobile Wallet Adapter, so this issue cannot be fully resolved on our end at this time.

EADX NEWS — WEEKLY UPDATE\n\n🗓️ Weekly update covering the main developments across the EADX Ecosystem.\n\nHello, community 👋\nBelow is a clear and direct summary of the most important advances from the past week.\n\n1️⃣ EADX Trader AI — Platform Ready (Final Stage)\n\nAfter approximately 10 months of continuous development, the EADX Trader AI platform has its entire operational core completed, tested, and validated.\n\nThe trading system is running in a stable on Binance Futures and consistent manner.\n\nAt this stage, the focus is on finalizing the front-end dashboard, where users will be able to:\naccess the platform,\nconfigure their information,\nand operate in a structured and secure way.\n\n2️⃣ Multichain Expansion — EDX Institutional Bridge Initiated\nWe have officially initiated the multichain expansion of EDX, using the EADX Exchange as an institutional bridge.\n\nThis model follows the same structure used by major industry players, ensuring:\nsupply control,\nsecurity,\nand a transparent 1:1 backing model.\n\nThe wrapped token WEDX contract will be made available soon, enabling users to request withdrawals directly from the EADX Exchange to the Solana network.\n\n3️⃣ EADX Rewards Campaign — Up to 20% in Rewards\nThe EADX Rewards Campaign is now live.\nAny user can participate by purchasing any ecosystem token inside the EADX Exchange.\n\nParticipants can receive up to 20% in rewards, choosing between:\n\n• EDX\n• EXD\n• USDX\n\nA campaign designed to encourage positioning, engagement, and long-term ecosystem building.\n\n4️⃣ Strategic Adjustment — EXD Pair Launch on Solana\n\nWe decided to postpone the EXD pair opening on Solana DEX in order to structure a proper launch aimed at native Solana users.\n\nThe assessment was clear: Opening the pair without prior awareness and positioning would only serve existing holders, leaving much of Solana’s potential untapped.\n\nWe are now structuring a dedicated launch to properly introduce:\nEXD,\nthe ecosystem,\nand the project’s utility to the Solana community.\n\n5️⃣ EADX Network Maintenance — Infrastructure Migration\nIn recent weeks, we initiated a server migration process, which caused temporary instability, including block explorer downtime.\n\nTechnical incompatibilities were identified during the migration and are now under control and in the final resolution phase.\n\n📌 Estimated resolution:\nFull normalization of the EADX Network and EAD Chain is expected by Monday, end of day.\n\n6️⃣ CoinGecko Exchange Listing — API Integration\nWe are actively working on adapting the EADX Exchange API to meet CoinGecko’s required exchange listing template.\n\nThis is a technical development task that resumed in early January following the year-end holiday period.\n\nProgress is ongoing to complete this step according to CoinGecko’s specifications.\n\n7️⃣ EXD Token — CoinMarketCap Update (Completed)\nThe update for the new EXD token on the Solana network has already been completed on CoinMarketCap.\n\nUsers can now:\nview updated token information,\ntrack EXD normally on the platform.\n\n💛 We continue building with structure, transparency, and a long-term vision.\n\nMore updates coming soon.\n\nBest,\nEADX
