It was a signal — and the numbers confirm it.\n1️⃣ The Initial Move: Sharp, But Intentionally Short\nPrice: $148 → $132 (≈ –10.8%) over ~36–48 hours, with no follow-through below the $130–132 zone. This is controlled displacement into a known acceptance range.\n2️⃣ Liquidations: Who Actually Paid?\nCoinGlass / Binance Perpetuals data shows ~$459K shorts liquidated vs ~$134K longs. If this were bearish continuation, long liquidations would dominate and cascades would follow. They didn’t.\n3️⃣ Open Interest Tells the Real Story\nOI moved from ~10.3M → ~9.5–9.8M, a –5% to –8% contraction. Positions were closed, not flipped. No aggressive short build-up — leverage was removed, not redeployed.\n4️⃣ Funding & Positioning\nAggregated Long/Short (taker buy/sell) around 0.86. Funding briefly dipped negative, then stabilized. No persistent funding bleed — fear, not conviction.\n5️⃣ Momentum Indicators\nOn 4H, RSI dropped to 25–30 (local oversold), MACD turned negative without acceleration. On 1D, RSI remains ~45, no confirmed bearish divergence. Classic reset.\nTL;DR 🧠\nThis wasn’t a dump. It was a reminder: ~10% correction, 5–8% leverage reduction, no bearish build-up, structure preserved.

Immediate support is clustered between $129–$133. Holding this zone is critical to avoid a deeper breakdown.
