This market volatility builds resilience. And understanding a few foundational concepts can help reduce the stress that comes with it.  One of the most important? Liquidity.  Think of liquidity like fuel in a car. Without it, nothing moves.

Through their tBTC token they facilitate BTC liquidity to flow into other DeFi ecosystems that result in much healthier and stronger protocols.   This also allows BTC holders to actually use their BTC as active capital instead of just sitting idle in a cold wallet.

This level has been a key support point since early 2024, so the pressure’s on to see whether it can hold up.  At this stage, we’re looking at a true make-or-break situation. If Solana manages to bounce from here, it could rally back towards $180 – $260, continuing its uptrend. But if it loses $120, things could get ugly, with potential drops to $75 or even $50.  The $120 zone has been a backbone for the entire bull run. If it breaks, we could be looking at a shift from bullish momentum to something much more bearish. On the flip side, if Solana defends this level, it could stay in the game as one of the stronger altcoins in 2026.  For now, traders are watching closely. A solid bounce or a reclaim of $140–$150 would be a good sign.

What actually matters is whether the infrastructure underneath can carry that growth without breaking.\n\nTON is entering 2026 with more users, more capital, and more attention than ever. That pressure exposes weak liquidity, fragmented routing, and governance systems that look good on paper but fail under scale.\nThis is where STON.fi’s position becomes clearer.\n\nWith over $33M in TVL and more than $6.8B in cumulative trading volume, STON.fi isn’t just participating in TON DeFi — it’s absorbing the load. Swaps, farming, DAO governance, and tokenized equities (xStocks) are being built into a single, coherent system rather than scattered features.\n\nThe part most users won’t notice is coordination. Liquidity doesn’t just sit in pools. It’s routed, optimized, and increasingly abstracted through Omniston, allowing STONfi to support apps, bots, and upcoming TON integrations without forcing users to think about mechanics.\n\nEvents like TON Gateway in Dubai this May aren’t the story by themselves. They’re signals of maturity, moments when infrastructure that already works is shown to a wider audience.\n\n\n@ston_fi isn’t chasing momentum in 2026.

This isn’t a one-day fluke-it’s a continuation of a trend where speed, low fees, and user demand are aligning fast.\n\nDEX volume doesn’t lie. It reflects actual behavior, not narratives. And right now, traders are voting with their capital-and choosing Solana.\n\nThe real question is simple: is this just peak momentum… or the early phase of Solana’s next dominance cycle?\n\n#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#","gravity_id":"373096523","id":100650,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T09:20:28.331Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T09:50:30.202Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-22T09:25:02.288Z","text_content":"Nato says Greenland sovereignty not discussed in US meeting after Trump claims 'framework of future deal'  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  $BTC  $SOL","gravity_id":"373096649","id":100660,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T09:30:08.979Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T10:00:30.903Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-22T09:28:04.036Z","text_content":"$SOL continues to lead daily DEX volume, recording about $4.7B in the last 24 hours.\n\n\nDEX activity on Solana is expected to keep growing, with new projects like Deriverse launching spot, perpetuals, and options trading.\n\n\nThe $SOL DeFi ecosystem remains highly active.\n\n\nI came across a simple TradFi trading video from BingX while learning about Gold, stocks, and indices.\n\n\nIt’s very beginner-friendly and explains the basics clearly, especially for anyone moving from crypto to traditional markets.

Sovereign tier airdrops.\n\nThese give the biggest rewards per phone. People who know the rules and act early can make a lot without trading or borrowing money.\n\nThe apps also give rewards for staying active. Season 2 apps in DeFi, gaming, and DePIN give rewards for staking, voting, and using apps.\n\nOver 100,000 users and developers have already received part of the 2 billion $SKR, claimed through the Seed Vault Wallet in a 90 day window. Unclaimed tokens go back in April 2026.\n\nThis isn’t about quick money. Listings on Bybit and Bithumb added real trading and activity, showing it’s about using the system, not casual buying.\n\nAnother factor is the mobile-first design.\n\nPeople earn rewards not just for having a phone but for using apps actively.\n\nThis keeps growth healthy and links $SKR to real participation.\n\nHistory shows why early participation matters.\n\nEarly users in Solana, Aptos, and Layer 2 airdrops got big rewards because they understood the system and stayed active.\n\nRight now, the Solana Mobile ecosystem is early and active.\n\nUsers who stake $SKR and take part in governance are building long term opportunities, while casual buyers mostly watch.\n\n$SKR shows how active the ecosystem is.\n\nTop users are the ones who gain most when early rewards unlock.\n\nMissed the phone or airdrop? It’s a bummer, but learning how to participate now can set you up for the next chance.\n\nThis is a live example of token rewards in action, showing how active participation creates real value over time.","gravity_id":"373097973","id":100668,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T09:30:29.289Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T10:00:30.256Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-22T09:31:45.036Z","text_content":"Cwallet × @Momo_bonk  Official Partnership Launched\n$MOMO is the first female Shiba meme coin on Solana, revived and built by the community with a commitment to long-term value and positive impact.\n\nWe have officially partnered with $MOMO and will soon launch a Launchpool staking mining event to drive this meaningful crypto movement together.\n\nTrade $MOMO now on Cwallet:\nhttps://t.co/jN4uBLfdqW\n\nDetails will be announced shortly.

Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs both saw heavy outflows on Jan 21, while $SOL   and $XRP  linked products quietly absorbed fresh capital. This doesn’t look like a broad exit - it looks like rotation.  Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $700M in net outflows in a single session, with redemptions spread across products from BlackRock, Fidelity and ARK Invest. The message is clear: exposure is being trimmed, not abandoned, as volatility and macro uncertainty keep conviction fragile.  Ethereum ETFs followed a similar path, posting roughly $287M in outflows. Interestingly, products without staking features saw the most pressure, while legacy structures held up better, a sign that yield mechanics and product design are starting to matter more than pure beta exposure.  Meanwhile, flows into Solana and XRP ETFs remained positive, albeit modest. Lower fees, staking support, and differentiated exposure appear to be pulling in more selective institutional capital.  The takeaway isn’t fear - it’s discrimination. Institutions are no longer treating crypto ETFs as a single trade. Allocation is becoming asset-specific, structure-driven, and tactical. That’s a sign of a maturing market, even if near-term price action stays choppy. #BTC Price Analysis#  #SolanaETF  #XRPETF  #Crypto","gravity_id":"373101223","id":100810,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T10:50:11.206Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T11:12:46.827Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-22T10:42:28.163Z","text_content":"$BTC  is currently testing a major decision area on the higher timeframe.

Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs both saw heavy outflows on Jan 21, while  $SOL and  $XRP linked products quietly absorbed fresh capital. This doesn't look like a broad exit - it looks like rotation.\n\nBitcoin ETFs recorded over $700M in net outflows in a single session, with redemptions spread across products from BlackRock, Fidelity and ARK Invest. The message is clear: exposure is being trimmed, not abandoned, as volatility and macro uncertainty keep conviction fragile.\n\nEthereum ETFs followed a similar path, posting roughly $287M in outflows.\nInterestingly, products without staking features saw the most pressure, while legacy structures held up better, a sign that yield mechanics and product design are starting to matter more than pure beta exposure.\n\nMeanwhile, flows into Solana and XRP ETFs remained positive, albeit modest. Lower fees, staking support, and differentiated exposure appear to be pulling in more selective institutional capital.\n\nThe takeaway isn't fear - it's discrimination. Institutions are no longer treating crypto ETFs as a single trade. Allocation is becoming asset-specific, structure-driven, and tactical. That's a sign of a maturing market, even if near-term price action stays choppy.\n#BTC Price Analysis# #SolanaETF\n#XRPETF #Crypto","gravity_id":"373102766","id":101003,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T12:30:11.112Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T14:00:31.745Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-22T12:25:51.745Z","text_content":"$SOL tg bot: rugpullmoonv3_bot\n\n\n#phantomwallet #solana #memecoinseason #crypto","gravity_id":"373102767","id":101007,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T12:30:29.748Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T14:10:33.982Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-22T12:25:41.406Z","text_content":"Solana Sets New Staking Record as SOL Trades Between $130–$150\nSolana has hit a new all-time high in staking value, signaling strong network participation even as SOL price action remains muted.\n\n $SOL is currently ranging between the mid $130s and mid $140s, with $150 acting as resistance and $130 as key support.

Introduction: Altcoins ( $ETH , $SOL  )vary widely on Binance, Bitget, Gate, MEXC, KuCoina and other platforms. They are focusing on what really matters: coin variety, fees, liquidity, and those hidden perks. Therefore, explore wisely, DYOR on every token, start small on new listings, and keep security first.   Then what actually matters when choosing an exchange? 1/ Good altcoin variety 2/ Strong liquidity 3/ Low fees 4/ Reliable execution 5/ Useful tools (like copy trading)   Are trading fees still important to consider? Absolutely. Most top exchanges still average around 0.1% spot fees, which looks small on paper but adds up fast for active traders. Platforms that offer discounts through native tokens or trading programs can significantly improve long-term profitability.   Which exchanges balance opportunity and safety best? • Gate / MEXC: Best for explorers and high-risk traders. • BitMart / LBank: Good for trends and memes. • Binance / Bybit: Strong execution, fewer listings. • Bitget: Best balance of variety, liquidity, low fees and tools.   Conclusion: Altcoin success isn’t about how many coins you can trade. It’s about how well you can trade them. From massive listings on Gate and MEXC to curated powerhouses like Binance, aside from Bitget, which consistently tops for its all-around prowess, blending 1,500+ coins with low fees, deep books, and innovations like copy trading and TradFi.   FAQ:  1. Do all exchanges offer the same altcoin access? No. Altcoin selection varies widely across platforms.  2. What risks come with more altcoins? More opportunities but higher risks like low liquidity, project failures, and volatility.  3. What’s the best overall altcoin exchange in 2026? Bitget & Binance for balance, performance, and flexibility.

Here is why the supply of $SOL   is getting tight:  The Key Numbers Staking Lock: About 70% of all Solana is locked in staking (a new record). For Ethereum, it is only about 30%.  Low Supply: Because so much $SOL   is staked, there is less available to buy or sell. When more people want to buy, the price can jump much faster.  Money Flow: More money is moving from other chains into Solana. The SOL/ETH chart shows that Solana is getting stronger every day.  The Bottom Line The market is currently nervous, but Solana’s setup is very strong.

We've added a Chrome extension - our wallet for account management and interaction with the ecosystem & chain. It's already in the process of being approved by Google. We'll probably also add it to the Firefox store later.\n\n⬛️We've initiated a beautiful new website redesign. It looks 10x more professional and better matches our trajectory as a serious builder in robotics space. We'll release a preview of our new website tomorrow.😉\n\n🟨Testnet has been running smoothly on 5 geographically distributed validators. The network is showing stability, but as always, minor tweaks, improvements, and fixes are needed. Before the last restart (initiated by us), the network reached a height of 709 738 blocks. This is fantastic! With the current parameters, the network generates ~150 blocks per epoch and a block time of 500ms.😱\n\n⬛️We've streamlined our Github branches—be sure to follow us, you can find the link in our bio🙏). No more weird names – everything essential is in the main branch, as well as the testing and feature branches. We've also agreed on a unified naming strategy for the blockchain and robotics departments.\n\n🟨We've successfully completed testing and research to find a suitable VM. We've tried SVM (@solana VM), MoveVM (@Aptos / @SuiNetwork), and, of course, EVM (@ethereum). EVM was deemed the best candidate, and its codebase is also written in Golang, so we're already in the process of integrating EVM into Modulr.⚡️\n\n⬛️We've made a number of minor improvements: added per-epoch statistics (for visualization in the explorer dashboards), and did bug fixes for servers stability and their interaction with the point of distribution. Also - added more advanced and detailed logging to make incident investigations easier for the team.\n\nThe work continues🦾","gravity_id":"373100970","id":101313,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T15:20:03.403Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T15:40:31.475Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-22T15:20:03.403Z","text_content":"$SOL Look, $500 isn’t some wild fantasy\nIt’s honestly conservative. and the market is just straight up blind right now.\n\n\nEveryone’s glued to the chart like that’s the whole story.\nMeanwhile the actual numbers are yelling in everyone’s face, Solana is already acting like a top L1 while getting priced like some random alt.\n\n\n1/ Users aren’t just growing. they’re pouring in and not leaving\nDaily actives, new wallets, people coming back. all hitting highs that haven’t been seen in years.\n\n\nNormal people and degens showing up at the same time.\nThat doesn’t just happen by accident.

Community engagement and early adoption on Solana Mobile Seeker also add to the buzz around the token.  That said, tokens with extreme short-term gains can be unpredictable.

Crypto-focused smartphones are gaining attention as more users look for built-in wallets, hardware-level security, and seamless access to Web3 apps. This positions  $SKR as more than just a tradable asset, but as a token tied to a real ecosystem where adoption can translate directly into on-chain demand.\nOne of the strongest catalysts behind the rally is staking. By locking up  $SKR, holders reduce the circulating supply while earning yield, which creates a natural supply squeeze during periods of rising interest. This dynamic often fuels momentum, especially when new users enter the ecosystem and need the token to participate in governance, device features, or premium services tied to the crypto phone platform.\nThe broader  $SOL ecosystem also plays a role in amplifying visibility. As Solana continues to position itself as a hub for consumer-facing crypto products, projects like SKR benefit from faster transactions, lower fees, and a growing user base that is already primed for mobile-first Web3 experiences.\nFrom a market structure perspective, strong volume and social engagement suggest that the move is being supported by real participation rather than thin liquidity spikes. When a token rally is accompanied by ecosystem updates, partnerships, or product milestones, it tends to attract longer-term holders instead of just short-term traders.\nLooking ahead, the bullish case for  $SKR rests on execution. If the team continues to ship hardware, expand staking utility, and onboard new users into the mobile crypto ecosystem, the current rally could evolve into a broader growth phase. In that scenario,  $SKR isn’t just reacting to hype—it’s building a narrative around real-world adoption in the next wave of Web3 accessibility.\n\n#Macro Insights# #Altcoin Season# #SolanaMobile","gravity_id":"373107009","id":101440,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T16:10:29.802Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T16:40:30.344Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-22T16:14:37.243Z","text_content":"$SOL At this point I think Solana's fast network and low fees are actually just a setup play to drain all our funds. Solana, with its multiple token creation platforms pumps and dumps on people relentlessly. All of Solana's highest market cap coins are down 70-90% since last Jan 1st. Solana itself is down 50% the past year. Billions upon billions have been  stolen from people just on the Solana Network alone. Furthermore if you start actually doing the math and adding up all the top Solana market cap coins back when they all reached their ATH (pretty much at the same time), the number is staggering.
