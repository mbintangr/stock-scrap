Some of the “risk premium” from tariff fears is easing, but bank targets, ETF flows, and miner strength still point to a firmly bullish backdrop.\n\nMarket trends\n• Political stress cools, but not gone: the Greenland–tariff saga that powered the latest leg higher is now partly unwinding. Headlines that President Trump is stepping back from tariff threats eased the most extreme demand for defensive assets and triggered a modest pullback from record levels. The risk mood improved, but the geopolitical and trade backdrop is far from calm.\n• Goldman turns more bullish: Goldman Sachs raised its gold target to 5,400 dollars by December 2026 (from 4,900). That’s a clear signal that, even with tactical pullbacks, the street still sees this as a structural bull market with higher long-term “ceiling” levels.\n• Dollar as headwind: the dollar is pushing higher. SWIFT data show USD’s share in global payments rose to 50.5% in December (from 46.8%), the highest since 2023 under the new methodology. A stronger dollar usually caps upside for gold and helps explain why price has paused after the latest surge.\n• ETF/ETC flows still roaring: despite record prices, issuance of physically backed products keeps growing:\n– Xtrackers IE Physical Gold EUR Hedged ETC: extra 74,000 units around €59.78 each; total series now 21,630,991 units, each backed by 0.0144 oz.\n– iShares Physical Gold ETC: fresh 3,119,000 units issued, pushing the series to 411,004,777 units.\nBig money is not dumping into strength, but quietly adding exposure into this high-price regime.\n\nTechs\nSupport: 4,750–4,800 dollars (recent breakout and consolidation zone)\nResistance: 4,950–5,000 dollars (round-number magnet if momentum resumes)\n\nEquities\nEquity markets are breathing a bit easier as tariff fears fade, which trims emergency demand for defensive assets but supports overall risk appetite. Within that context, gold miners and streaming names remain standout winners.\n• Rotation into leveraged gold plays:\n– Barrick Mining recently hit a 52-week high around 50.54 dollars.\n– Wheaton Precious Metals printed a new all-time high near 145.52 dollars.\n– Kinross Gold tagged a record around 37.46 dollars, with mentions of overbought RSI in market commentary.\nCapital is clearly reaching for “gold beta,” not just the metal itself.\n• Operations backing the move:\n– Resolute Mining: Q4 production of 65,918 oz, with 2026 guidance at 250–275k oz and AISC at 2,000–2,200 dollars.\n– Aris Mining: full-year 2025 output of 256,503 oz, up 22% year-on-year and above the midpoint of guidance.\nStrong operational delivery gives investors more confidence that the current price regime can translate into real cash flow.\n\nRWA & tokenization\nIn parallel, the real-world-asset stack keeps deepening, building more rails that can intersect with gold and other hard assets.\n• On-chain scale: within the Solana ecosystem alone, RWA market cap has now tagged 1 billion dollars, excluding stablecoins.\n• Macro TVL shift: RWAs have overtaken DEXs in total value locked, with around 21.4 billion dollars now sitting in tokenized Treasuries, private credit, and commodities.\n• Legacy giants leaning in:\n– BlackRock CEO Larry Fink calls “tokenization of financial assets and AI” the two megatrends that will reshape financial services.\n– The New York Stock Exchange is building a platform for 24/7 trading and instant settlement of tokenized securities.\nThese are structural signals that the infrastructure for putting real assets, including metals, on programmable rails is moving from pitch deck to implementation.\n\nCrypto vs Gold\nIn this phase, the “digital gold” story looks weaker when you compare actual price behavior.\n• BTC / gold ratio slides: the bitcoin-to-gold ratio has dropped to around 18.5 oz per BTC, highlighting how much more strongly gold has performed as a defensive anchor in this window of uncertainty.\n• Role split:\n– Gold is reacting cleanly to geopolitical and trade risks, holding a risk premium even with a stronger dollar.\n– Bitcoin is not showing comparable defensive behavior; its crisis-hedge narrative remains contested once you look at real price action rather than marketing.\nWhat to watch\n• Trade rhetoric: any fresh twists or U-turns on the Greenland story can quickly reprice the “risk premium” baked into gold.\n• Dollar dynamics: further USD strength, backed by its growing role in payments is the main short-term headwind for gold.\n• ETC issuance: continued large-scale issuance and inflows will confirm that institutional demand is still there on any dip.\n• Miners’ price action: whether leaders like Barrick, Wheaton, and Kinross can hold near record levels will say a lot about how broad and durable the trend is.\n\nTakeaways\n• Gold: the market is shifting from a vertical spike to a tactical pause as tariff fears cool. But Goldman’s 5,400-dollar target for December 2026 and ongoing ETC issuance underline a structurally bullish backdrop. Baseline: high prices with the risk of sharp but brief pullbacks when headlines calm down. Strategy: hold core exposure; add only on clear dips and only while macro and political risk remain elevated.\n• Miners: the sector shows exceptional strength with a cluster of all-time and 52-week highs, but local overheating is likely. Focus on leaders with solid guidance and real operating momentum; be careful with names that have run hard without matching fundamentals.\n• Crypto: stance stays neutral-to-negative on the “defensive” axis. The current configuration of risks and returns still favors classic metal over coin, and the BTC/gold ratio reflects that shift.\n\nNot financial advice. Always do your own research.","gravity_id":"373110317","id":101750,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T19:20:07.542Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T20:20:29.735Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-22T19:19:23.962Z","text_content":"$SOL  Minor support for wave B sits in the $126–$127.25 range.

Hey bro! Solana's co-founder, Toly, just dropped a manifesto that hits right at the core problem. We're all tired of schemes where we, the retail traders, always end up losing. He's proposing a clear formula to change that.  The essence of his plan is simple:  1. Staking is the foundation. Long-term holders are rewarded, not speculators.  2. >20% of tokens in circulation from day one. No more 2% liquidity with billions in FDV.  3. Investors (if absolutely necessary) get a 100% unlock only after one year. No lengthy vesting schedules.  4. The team also waits.  Why is this a game-changer for us traders?  Because the current model is a trap. Funds get in early for pennies. A tiny fraction of tokens hits the public market with a sky-high valuation (FDV). We see the hype and buy in. Then, 6-12 months later, insider unlocks start, and the price crashes under a ton of selling pressure. We're just being used for exit liquidity.  Toly's model breaks this scheme. If there's a large circulating supply from day one, the price is set by the real market. If investors can only exit after a year and all at once, the team is motivated to build, not just wait for their unlock. The risk of a post-TGE crash plummets.  What happens if this gets adopted?  - Fewer \"scams\": Fewer projects created just for VC unlocks.  - Fair price discovery: Market cap will be closer to reality, not inflated FDV.  - Community power: Projects with strong staking communities will have an advantage.  This is a challenge to the entire funding industry. And Solana, as the most hype-driven L1, might just be the one to push it through.  Question: Do you think any major project will dare to launch by Toly's rules, or will they all fear the wrath of the venture funds?  $SOL  #SOL  #Solana  #Crypto  #CryptoNews  #Web3","gravity_id":"373113483","id":101871,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T20:40:29.767Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T21:10:30.885Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-22T20:33:58.353Z","text_content":"A landmark milestone for Solana: the network has locked a historic $60 BILLION in staked $SOL .

By enabling Bitcoin liquidity to move into DeFi environments through tBTC, Threshold helps transform BTC from a static store of value into productive, onchain capital, without sacrificing your custody.

With Omniston now working alongside Privy, developers can ship real token swap functionality inside TON-enabled apps without wrestling with custom wallet logic or liquidity routing. What used to take weeks can now be done in minutes — clean, composable, and production-ready.  Privy already powers wallet infrastructure across hundreds of chains. By extending that stack to TON and pairing it with Omniston’s liquidity aggregation, builders get embedded wallets plus optimized swaps out of the box. Same-chain routing, access to long-tail TON assets, and execution powered by STONfi’s aggregation layer — all handled under the hood.  The impact goes beyond developer convenience. Users can onboard, connect a wallet, and execute their first on-chain action inside the app itself, without friction or context switching. That’s how TON scales from curiosity to daily usage, especially in Telegram-native environments where speed and simplicity matter.  New community recipes now walk teams through: • Launching a TON app with Privy (Vite + React) • Adding embedded wallets and smooth onboarding • Executing TON swaps via Omniston and STONfi routing  Whether you’re already building on TON or exploring it as a new execution layer, this setup removes the usual barriers and lets you focus on product logic — not infrastructure.  📚 Start here: ➫ https://docs.privy.io/recipes/community/ton-vite-react   ➫ https://docs.privy.io/recipes/community/ton-omniston-swap   Read and explore more about STONfi here: https://linktr.ee/ston.fi   #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#  $BTC  $SOL  #TON  #Bullish","gravity_id":"373119010","id":102135,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T00:30:06.675Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T02:00:29.701Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-23T00:52:45.040Z","text_content":"Solana treasury firm DeFi Development Corp. launched a meme coin on Thursday and quickly became the subject of insider trading allegations.

That pace wasn’t a one-off moment — it defined December. Over the course of the month, users completed 732,067 swaps, averaging one transaction roughly every four seconds. No hype, just consistent on-chain activity flowing through the protocol day and night.  What makes this interesting isn’t only the raw count. That frequency reflects real usage: traders reacting to price movements, liquidity moving efficiently, and TON DeFi operating at a rhythm that feels closer to Web2 speed than traditional DeFi friction.  When swaps happen this often, it signals more than volume. It points to reliability, execution confidence, and a user base that keeps coming back because the experience works. Fast confirmation, deep liquidity, repeat behavior — these are the ingredients that turn a DEX into infrastructure.  December showed that STONfi isn’t just being tried out.

Introduction  Crypto staking in 2026 offers passive income, but success depends on choosing the right platforms for each asset and risk level. Providers differ by supported coins and models, so comparing rewards, lock-ups, security, and reliability is key to a strong staking strategy.  Which platforms are best for staking major cryptocurrencies like ETH, SOL, and ADA?  Major Layer-1 assets are widely supported. Leading exchanges like Bitget, Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and OKX offer easy staking for $ETH  , $SOL  , and ADA. For self-custody, Lido and Rocket Pool enable liquid Ethereum staking with on-chain exposure and DeFi access.  Which platforms are better suited for staking altcoins and emerging tokens?  For broader altcoin access, platforms like KuCoin, Bitget , crypto(.)com, and Bybit stand out. These exchanges support a wider range of mid-cap and newer assets, often pairing them with higher promotional APYs. However, these opportunities typically carry greater volatility and platform risk.  Which staking platforms fit different investor profiles best?  Beginners often prefer centralized platforms due to simplicity and customer support, while advanced users lean toward decentralized protocols for transparency and control.  Conclusion  The best staking platform depends on the cryptocurrency, desired flexibility, and risk tolerance. Matching assets with suitable platforms improves long-term staking outcomes.  FAQs  Is staking still viable for beginners in 2026? Yes, especially on user-friendly centralized platforms.  Do decentralized platforms eliminate risk? No, they reduce custody risk but introduce smart-contract risks.

The core implementation is finished, and we are now focused on deep integration and reorganizing the application for seamless, production ready performance. The first TEE powered services are expected to launch in February on the Sallar network as a powerful new utility layer for enterprises and individual users alike.   TEEs solve a core modern challenge: processing sensitive data safely on systems you do not fully control, especially in the cloud. They originated in the early 2000s with ARM TrustZone for mobile devices and later expanded through major industry efforts such as Intel SGX and AMD SEV. Their main purpose is confidential computing: protecting data during active processing even when the host OS or cloud provider might be untrusted.   For everyday phone users, TEE is quietly responsible for security features we rely on daily. Contactless payments are designed so payment credentials and signing operations are handled inside secure, hardware backed components, reducing exposure even if the main OS is compromised. Biometric templates are typically stored and matched inside secure environments, so apps and the broader system do not receive raw biometric data. Password manager keys, secure boot checks that help detect device tampering, and protected media playback commonly depend on TEE style isolation to keep sensitive operations separated and harder to extract.   For Sallar users, this means businesses can run confidential workflows with provable, tamper resistant execution, while individuals get significantly safer personal data handling in practical tools. In February, we expect to deliver the first live TEE utilities, and we will expand the feature set step by step afterward.

Introduction: Several cryptocurrency exchanges offer both margin trading and futures trading, providing traders with flexible ways to amplify positions. Platforms like Bitget, Binance, Bybit, OKX, Kraken, and Crypto,com vary in leverage, tools and safety. So we need to choose the best one for us to trade $ETH , $SOL  & others.   What to look for in a platform? • High leverage + deep books (no slippage on big orders) • Isolated/cross modes + position tweaks • Low fees. • Proof-of-reserves + insurance funds for peace of mind   What is the biggest risk of margin and leveraged trading in crypto? Margin and leverage amplify both gains and losses. Even small market moves can wipe out your position or lead to liquidation. Always use risk tools like stop-loss and isolated margin!  Which exchange fits your style? • Derivatives-heavy & high leverage → Bitget, Binance, Bybit • Strategy-focused traders → OKX • Risk-conscious & regulation-first → Kraken, Crypto,com  Bitget shines with its balance: high leverage, wide futures pairs, copy trading, and solid risk tools under one roof.   Conclusion: Futures/margin trading isn't a one size fits all game; it's about aligning platform perks with your risk tolerance. Bitget offers higher limits with real-time risk tools and adjustable leverage per position. So we can choose it for your trading.  FAQ: 1. What’s the main risk of margin/leverage trading? It amplifies both gains and losses. A small 1% market move can wipe out your position at high leverage.   2. How to avoid liquidation? Use low leverage (2-5x), set stop-losses, choose isolated margin, keep buffers, and monitor positions.  3. Which exchanges are best for high-leverage futures in 2026? Bitget, Binance, Bybit for 125x and liquidity; OKX for advanced tools; Kraken/Cryptocom for security.
