While SOL has seen consistent selling, it continues to draw strong interest from institutional investors.  $BTC  is currently near $89,000 and #Ethereum  around $2,950, with both showing promising signs of a rebound. However, uncertainty lingers after the Senate paused its sessions on Monday to review a cryptocurrency bill.  SOL recently dipped to $127, extending its retreat from recent peaks above $130. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 39.35, suggesting weakness and a move toward oversold territory. This cautious sentiment is reflected in the MACD, which sits at 0.30. Traders are now watching for any signals of a potential reversal that could help the price recover from this range.  Key resistance levels sit near $130 and $140. A sustained break above $150 would likely renew bullish momentum for Solana's long-term outlook, but for now, the token remains under pressure. On the downside, support is expected around $120. If selling persists, Solana could test the $110 level. ﻿#Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373169247","id":105592,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T18:20:08.216Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T19:30:32.303Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-24T18:28:45.215Z","text_content":"I think this run is starting..\n\nBad Bunny OG on Solana. 5k mc now.\n$Benito\n\nFqXRSYpSGkDQ2CGgfUNRz5rBije4R4ArBUjLKbXLrapY ","gravity_id":"373168837","id":105612,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T18:30:30.364Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T19:40:31.995Z"},{"crypto_id":"5426","crypto_name":"SOL","post_time":"2026-01-24T18:27:10.277Z","text_content":"$SOL HOLDING KEY SUPPORT AFTER THE FLUSH\n\n$SOL got flushed hard.

Price has been boxed into a narrow $127–$129 range, forming a clear triangle on the lower timeframes - the kind of structure that usually doesn’t last long.  Right now, buyers and sellers are locked in balance. Higher lows and lower highs are squeezing price toward the apex, while volatility keeps fading. That’s usually a warning sign that a larger move is loading, even if direction isn’t decided yet.  This zone matters because it’s where short-term positioning is concentrated. Stops are stacking on both sides, which means once SOL gets a clean close outside the range, follow-through can be fast. A move above $129 would flip momentum back in favor of continuation, while a loss of $127 risks opening the door to another leg lower.  Context still matters. Broader market conditions remain cautious, and SOL is already down on the week, trading near $125.6 after slipping out of the range. That keeps traders selective rather than aggressive.  Still, consolidation itself isn’t bearish. Sideways action often resets momentum and clears excess leverage. The longer $SOL  coils here, the more meaningful the eventual breakout is likely to be.
