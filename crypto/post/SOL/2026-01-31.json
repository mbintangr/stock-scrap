The clean break below the $120 support level is a major signal, driven by a confluence of institutional outflows and macro pressure.\n\n\nWe're seeing clear signs of weakness from larger players. Solana ETFs just registered $2.2M in outflows, and its associated trust is trading at a significant 12% discount to NAV. This lack of institutional demand is creating heavy selling pressure.

On the daily chart, the trend remains bearish after the sharp drop from the 148 area down to around 111–112, which is the recent low. Price is now trading near 117, but this move does not show any strong recovery yet. The overall structure is still weak, and  $SOL is trading well below its previous support levels.\n\nOn the lower timeframe, price bounced from the 114–115 area and moved up toward 119, but that bounce was rejected quickly. Since then, SOL has been moving sideways around 116–117, showing hesitation and lack of momentum. Buyers are not strong enough to push price higher, and volume does not support a bullish move.\n\nAt the moment, this looks like consolidation after a drop, not a reversal. As long as SOL stays below 119–120, the market remains weak, and any upside move should be treated as a temporary bounce. If price fails to hold above 115, another move toward the recent low around 111–112 is possible.\n\nOverall, the trend is still bearish.

If we see clear rejection and reversal signs here, this could trigger a slide first to 117.15 USDT and potentially down to 114.34 USDT. - If price breaks and closes above 123.12 USDT with strong bullish momentum, this bias flips and I would expect a move towards 125.60 USDT or even up to the most recent high of 128.34 USDT. - For now, look for confirmation of rejection in the 119.12–123.12 USDT zone, such as a bearish engulfing candle, a strong pin bar, or a clear momentum shift on lower timeframes. That’s your cue to enter short, aiming for 117.15 USDT and 114.34 USDT as your targets. - If you see price consolidating or forming a bullish structure above 123.12 USDT, do not enter short and instead wait for a breakout retest setup to go long towards higher levels.  📊 Get detailed free analysis of any coin on any timeframe you want.

While some exchanges share user data with tax authorities, others do not. Understanding this difference is essential for U.S. taxpayers.   \r \r Which exchanges do not report?\r Decentralized exchanges and foreign centralized exchanges that do not serve U.S. residents generally do not report to the IRS. They do not issue tax forms, but tax obligations still apply.   \r \r Why DEXs do not report\r DEXs operate via smart contracts without user accounts or identity checks. Platforms like Uniswap and PancakeSwap collect no personal data, though all transactions are visible on public blockchains.   \r \r Non-U.S. centralized exchanges\r Platforms such as Bitget and OSL comply with local regulations, not U.S. tax law. Users are responsible for self-reporting.   \r \r Peer-to-peer platforms\r Usually non-custodial and non-reporting, though some apply limited identity checks.\r \r Does non-reporting remove tax duties?\r No. U.S. taxpayers must report worldwide crypto income and gains. The IRS uses blockchain analytics to track activity.   \r \r How crypto is taxed\r Crypto is treated as property. Capital gains apply to sales or swaps, while income tax applies to mining, staking, and rewards.    \r \r Overall\r Non-reporting exchanges reduce data sharing, not taxes owed.

INTRODUCTION Converting Peruvian Soles (PEN) to US Dollars (USD) in 2026 depends largely on how the exchange is made. Cash withdrawals, card payments, and online transfers all apply different fees and exchange rate markups, which can noticeably reduce the final amount received, especially for larger transactions.   Why do PEN/USD rates differ by method? Banks, card issuers, ATM operators, and transfer platforms each use their own pricing models. These include FX markups, fixed service fees, foreign transaction charges, and Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC), which often increases costs when accepted.  How much can rates vary? • Online transfers and crypto platforms: ~0.5–1.5% above mid-market • Fee-free card payments: ~1–2% • Cards with FX fees: ~2–4% • ATM withdrawals: ~3–8% • Airport exchanges: 10% or more As of January 2026, the mid-market rate is about 1 PEN = 0.298 USD, though actual payouts are usually lower after fees.  Why are ATMs more expensive? ATM withdrawals combine bank FX fees, operator charges, and hidden rate markups. Accepting DCC can add an extra 3–8% to the cost.  Which option is most efficient? Fintech and crypto platforms like Wise, Revolut, and Bitget typically offer the best rates. Cards are convenient but vary by issuer, while cash and airport exchanges are the least cost-effective.  Conclusion Online transfers consistently provide the best value for PEN/USD conversions. Cards sit in the middle, while ATMs and airport desks remain the most expensive. Choosing the right method can significantly reduce long-term conversion losses.  FAQ (Quick Answers)  • Current rate: ~0.298 USD per PEN • Bank rates worse than Google? Fees + markups • Pay in PEN or USD? PEN • Cheapest transfers?

If there’s a manipulation wick below 108.15 with a strong reversal candle, I expect price to rebound toward 109.72 and potentially test 110.14, especially if momentum turns. - If price is rejected from the 109.72–110.14 range and forms a lower high, I expect another push lower, with 108.50 as the first target. - To enter, wait for confirmation: for longs, look for a convincing rejection just below 108.15; for shorts, look for reversal confirmation near the 110.14 area. Adjust your bias if price manages to close and hold above 110.14 with strong bullish candles—then, a move toward 111.75 could quickly develop. - If there is no clear rejection or reversal at these levels and price just cuts through, stay flat and wait for the next setup.   📊 Get detailed free analysis of any coin on any timeframe you want.

Take profit targets could be layered at 109.98 and 105.00. - Only consider a reversal bias (long) if price reclaims and closes above 114.29 with strong bullish volume or if you see a powerful low-forming reversal pattern below 105.00. - For confirmation, always look for clear price action — such as pin bars, engulfing candles, or lower timeframe breakdowns/rejections at resistance before entering. - This is a prime spot for a trend-following short trade off a retracement, but trade management and confirmation are key in this volatile environment.  📊 Get detailed free analysis of any coin on any timeframe you want.
