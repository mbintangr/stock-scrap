This follows recent losses as the broader crypto market declined.  Analysis of the daily chart shows some bearish indicators, but a potential falling wedge pattern is forming, which is often viewed as a signal for a bullish reversal. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator also shows a bullish divergence, suggesting the downtrend may be losing momentum.  For the bullish outlook to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above the upper boundary of the falling wedge pattern. A key resistance level to watch in that scenario is $3. The bullish view would be invalidated if the price falls below the recent support near $1.82.  A potential factor influencing price is demand for XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Recent data shows these funds have seen significant inflows, bringing their total assets under management near $1 billion. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371559710","id":305,"createdAt":"2025-12-02T19:20:03.452Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-02T19:40:04.134Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-02T19:22:51.723Z","text_content":"$XRP funny how everything pretty much went back to where it was before the dump 😂.

With indicators aligned in favor of upward movement, traders are keenly watching the next potential price targets.  Currently, XRP faces immediate resistance at 2.215. A solid close above this point could lead to a bullish surge towards 2.275. In case of a pullback, the 2.107 level is poised to act as support, where a bullish reaction might present a prime long opportunity. However, if the price rejects strongly from 2.215 and slips below 2.107, caution is advised as the bias could shift bearish.  This is only a partial view.

A significant break below 1.93 could signal a drop toward 1.82 and potentially lower to 1.70.

The move follows a broader market rebound, with Bitcoin recovering above $93K and Ether reclaiming the $3K zone.  A key catalyst behind the shift in momentum: 🧠 Growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut next week — a macro trigger that historically boosts liquidity across risk assets, including Bitcoin, XRP, and high-beta altcoins.  🟦 Market Structure: Bearish… but Softening  Despite the bounce, XRP’s 4H chart remains inefficient, trading under major EMAs: • 50-day EMA → $2.32 • 100-day EMA → $2.47 • 200-day EMA → $2.50  However, there are early signals of trend improvement: • MACD histogram flipped positive, with the blue line crossing above signal — rising upside momentum • RSI at 43, indicating fading bearish pressure • Price reclaiming the $2.20 zone, a level that needs a decisive close to unlock higher targets  🎯 Key Level: The $2.5 Psychological Zone  If $XRP   sustains its recovery and breaks cleanly above $2.20, the next upside objectives come into focus: • $2.50 - psychological + EMA cluster • $2.63 - major resistance A break and hold above these levels would confirm a stronger bullish reversal.  But if momentum fades? The market could see a return to the $1.90 support, which has held firm across previous downturns.  🧠 Bottom Line  The setup is shifting from defensive to opportunistic. XRP isn’t out of the woods - but the market is giving it room to move.  A dovish Fed next week could be the catalyst that decides whether XRP pushes into the $2.5+ zone, or stalls before resistance. #Ripple  #Altcoin Season#  #XRP","gravity_id":"371585178","id":1963,"createdAt":"2025-12-03T13:00:05.962Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-03T13:10:04.845Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-03T12:52:17.067Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $XRP","gravity_id":"371582331","id":1964,"createdAt":"2025-12-03T13:00:06.032Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-03T13:10:04.885Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-03T12:51:28.715Z","text_content":"XRP Ledger Whale Activity Santiment reports that $XRP   whale and shark wallets have declined over the last 8 weeks  yet remaining large holders have accumulated to a 7-year high of 48B XRP.","gravity_id":"371585128","id":1965,"createdAt":"2025-12-03T13:00:06.106Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-03T13:10:04.926Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-03T13:09:04.485Z","text_content":"$XRP moving above $2 with steady volume is showing how quickly sentiment shifts once it gets a clean breakout instead of its usual slow grind.
