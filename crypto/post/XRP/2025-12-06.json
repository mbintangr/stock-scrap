Bullish signals: Technical indicators (RSI, MACD) suggest XRP is short-term oversold, often preceding a corrective bounce. Potential recovery could push $XRP   toward $2.12–$2.25, if ETF inflows pick up again.

Despite bullish signals in on chain activity, the token remains locked in a narrow range, frustrating investors who anticipated a breakout.  On Chain Activity Dormancy Surge: XRP dormancy has climbed to a three-month high, indicating coins are being held longer before moving.  Spent Coins Drop: Spent coins have fallen by 91%, a sign of reduced sell pressure.  Bullish Setup: These conditions typically precede upward momentum, suggesting potential breakout readiness.  Why the Breakout Hasn’t Happened Long Term Holder Distribution: Despite reduced sell pressure, long term holders continue to offload tokens.  Bearish Tug of War: This distribution creates resistance against bullish signals, keeping XRP trapped below $2.28.  Range Bound Since Mid November: Price action has remained stuck in the same band, reflecting indecision in the market.  Outlook for Traders Short Term Bearish Bias: Continued distribution by long term holders caps upside potential.  Breakout Watch: A shift in holder behavior or renewed demand could unlock a move beyond $2.28.  Key Indicator: Monitoring dormancy and spent coin metrics will be crucial for spotting early breakout signals.  XRP’s dormancy spike and reduced sell pressure suggest bullish potential, but long-term holder distribution is keeping the token stuck below $2.28. Until this tug of war resolves, XRP’s price analysis remains range-bound and cautious, with traders watching closely for the next decisive move. #Altcoin Season#  #BNBChain#  #XRP","gravity_id":"371694649","id":8576,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T16:10:06.559Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T16:40:05.984Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-06T16:16:45.051Z","text_content":"🗞 Top #CryptoNews: Sat, Dec 6 (24H)\n\n1️⃣ Bitcoin thieves stole $1.1B using fake bird noises: Now Malaysia hunts heat signatures from the sky\n\n2️⃣ XRP sentiment has collapsed, but a “Fear Zone” signal hints that retail sellers are making a costly error\n\nhttps://cryptoslate.com/top-news/","gravity_id":"371692878","id":8586,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T16:20:03.834Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T16:50:06.909Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-06T16:22:45.055Z","text_content":"XRP holders active this weekend? 💧","gravity_id":"371694737","id":8607,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T16:30:05.492Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-06T17:10:06.336Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-06T16:34:45.054Z","text_content":"Ohh no, this is happening really?\n\n🤯\n\n$XRP accumulation from ETFs is kinda wild.\n\n15 days = $861M bought\n\nAlmost 1% of supply already.\n\nIf this keeps up, the chart won’t stay calm for long.\n\nSomething unexpected coming..
