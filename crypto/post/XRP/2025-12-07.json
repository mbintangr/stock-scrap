According to Odaily Planet Daily, the fund now holds 62,994,999.475 XRP, custodied by Coinbase. At current prices, that’s a market value of roughly $127.83 million. The ETF’s total net asset value stands at $125.63 million, with 5.7 million shares already in circulation.

Since the massive $1.9B flash crash on October 10, U.S. equities have rebounded about +8% with many names at new highs, while BTC still sits roughly −29% below its peak, clearly lagging risk assets.\n ・This Q4 is shaping up to be the “second worst Q4 in Bitcoin’s history.” Elevated volatility and repeated liquidation waves define the current unstable conditions.\n ・Small business bankruptcies in the U.S. are surging: 2,221 Subchapter V filings this year, the highest on record and +83% over the last five years. High borrowing costs, cautious consumption, and uncertainty are squeezing small firms and slowly reinforcing recession fears.\n ・The Russell 2000 is retesting its November 2021 all-time high. A breakout here could be a key signal confirming a full-scale bull market into 2026 and a potential ignition for a true altcoin season.\n ・U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs again saw net outflows this week. While there are occasional small inflows, overall flows remain weak, underlining the current “heavy market” structure.\n ・At the same time, the top 100 publicly listed companies now hold around 1,059,000 BTC in total. Combined ETF + public-company holdings have finally surpassed exchange reserves, marking a structural shift in BTC demand.\n ・Major players like France’s BPCE (3rd largest bank), Sony, and Western Union are entering BTC and stablecoin services, accelerating real-world usage and adoption.\n ・Global M2 is expanding rapidly. Together with a global shift toward monetary easing, this is strengthening the medium- to long-term narrative that excess liquidity will eventually flow into risk assets, including Bitcoin.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOn-chain & Technical Trends\n ・2,400 BTC that had been dormant for over 10 years (worth about $216M) suddenly moved, drawing attention to whale and old-holder activity.\n ・The combined BTC holdings of ETFs and listed companies have now surpassed exchange balances, showing a historic shift in the balance between “long-term accumulators” and coins sitting on sell-side order books.\n ・The Exchange Whale Ratio has climbed above 0.5, and on Binance it has reached the highest level since April 2025. Whale deposits to exchanges are typically a strong signal of increasing sell pressure.\n ・The Puell Multiple is stable around 0.8. The structural mid-cycle bottom zone appears to be forming in the 0.45–0.55 range, while extreme capitulation spikes into the 0.3 area look less likely compared with past cycles.\n ・The Taker Buy/Sell Ratio (TBSR) has remained below 1 since mid-2025, with the 30-day SMA at a low 0.97. This indicates not just short-term but structural sell dominance, during which BTC has fallen from $120K to $81K.\n ・On December 5, $3.4B in BTC options expired, pulling price strongly lower as spot converged toward the max pain level at $91,000, with a temporary dip to $89,500. Funding turned negative, confirming clear short dominance in futures.\n ・On Binance, BTC rallied over 5% on December 3 while $657M in USDT flowed out. This is the exact opposite of the usual “price up = capital inflow” pattern. Historical data show that price discovery is now being driven mainly by the derivatives market, with spot flows arriving later.\n ・Post-Fusaka upgrade, ETH’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio on Binance has recovered to a 4-month high. While spot price is still in the low $3,000s, the speed of this indicator’s rebound suggests an early phase of a potential move toward the $3,500–$4,000 range.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nSentiment\n ・Many analysts argue that the current drawdown from $126K to $80K is “not a normal correction.” Nearly every other day sees ~$500M in liquidations, and every bounce is aggressively sold into, which is deeply unsettling for market participants.\n ・Rumors are spreading that major institutions are “hunting both longs and shorts” and that a large fund may have blown up on October 10 and is now selling to plug the hole—adding a layer of distrust to the market.\n ・Meanwhile, an Arkham-identified whale has built massive long positions across ETH, XRP, and HYPE (hundreds of millions of dollars), showing that big money is actively stepping into altcoins.\n ・DAT-related stocks such as MSTR, Metaplanet, SMLR, and NAKA have suffered heavy crashes, with NAKA dropping over 98%, resembling meme-coin style collapses and fueling caution toward leverage and thematic bubbles.\n ・On the positive side, ultra-bullish statements are making a comeback: Tom Lee expects BTC to hit a new ATH by January 2026, and Chamath calls Bitcoin “Money 2.0” and “a massively important asset,” reinforcing the long-term narrative.\n ・In U.S. politics, the BITCOIN Act is moving forward, and public spats over crypto between figures like Peter Schiff and Trump’s camp are intensifying, highlighting both regulatory risk and opportunity.\n ・The AI sector is up 32% over the last 30 days with market cap above $11B. AI × Crypto names such as TAO, Warden, Autonolas, Delysium, Ritual, Wayfinder, AGIX, and FET are gaining traction, supporting risk appetite in the longer-term “next theme” trade.\n ・Overall, fear and optimism coexist: retail is prone to panic selling and forced liquidations, while professional capital quietly accumulates on dips—a classic behavior gap that is once again clearly visible.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nU.S. Legacy Markets\n ・Despite the Fed cutting rates by 150 bps since September 2024, 10Y and 30Y yields remain higher than pre-cut levels. Markets see this as a “policy error,” increasing pressure on the Fed.\n ・UBS projects the Fed may begin buying $40B/month in T-bills in early 2026, effectively restarting QE. Continued liquidity stress among regional banks also points toward renewed balance-sheet expansion.\n ・Analysts like Crypto Rover argue that QE’s return would mean lower rates, a weaker dollar, and strong inflows into risk assets—potentially recreating a 2020–2021-style mega rally environment.\n ・Coinbase’s proprietary M2 index correctly anticipated a weak November and now signals that “December is likely to see a recovery,” citing improving liquidity, a persistent AI boom, and increasing attractiveness of dollar shorts—hinting at a possible “December rally.”\n ・The Russell 2000’s retest of the 2021 highs is crucial. A breakout could historically correlate with a surge in altcoins, echoing past cycles where U.S. small caps and alts moved in tandem.\n ・Vanguard, with $10T in AUM, holds about $3.2B worth of MicroStrategy stock, giving it substantial indirect BTC exposure. Even the world’s largest asset managers are quietly accumulating Bitcoin risk.\n ・The spot XRP ETF has bought $863M worth of XRP over the last 15 days, roughly 1% of total supply, showing that ETF flows are spreading beyond BTC to other major assets.\n ・At the regulatory and policy level, comments about “putting all markets on-chain within two years” and considering additional BTC purchases with fiscally neutral tools underscore that U.S. market infrastructure and sovereign BTC strategy may be entering a new phase.\n―――――――――――――――――――\nOverall Assessment\nIn the short term, the market remains in a “high-volatility range with a downward bias,” driven by structural sell dominance (TBSR < 1), rising whale deposits to exchanges, weak ETF flows, and repeated liquidation cascades. At the same time, long-term bullish drivers are strengthening: ETF + public-company holdings now exceed exchange reserves, global banks and corporates are adopting BTC and stablecoins, and macro liquidity is on a path that likely turns favorable once QE resumes.\nToday’s XWIN TREND INDEX is 52 / 100, with a “neutral / no clear direction” bias.\nLooking one month ahead, the setup combines:\n ・Potential QE restart by the Fed\n ・Global M2 expansion\n ・A possible breakout in the Russell 2000\n ・Growing AI, DAT, and ETF-driven flows\nThese factors collectively form a medium- to long-term tailwind. However, in the near term, whale-driven derivatives action, ongoing ETF outflows, and the risk of a move into the $70K range mean downside cannot be ignored. The appropriate stance is “defensive neutrality”: keep leverage extremely low, accumulate BTC, ETH, and high-quality alts in staggered spot entries, and closely track ETF flows, TBSR, and the Russell 2000. The goal is to balance dip-buying opportunities with preparedness for additional downside and short-cover rallies.","gravity_id":"371701469","id":9120,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T22:50:02.658Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T01:30:06.639Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-06T22:53:04.139Z","text_content":"$XRPwhy and how is XRP one of few in the red today","gravity_id":"371701506","id":9134,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T23:00:04.257Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T01:40:06.118Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-06T23:04:21.119Z","text_content":"$XRP Look at things from a different perspective than you have before, because that means starting a new life.","gravity_id":"371702461","id":9142,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T23:10:05.029Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T02:00:06.136Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-06T23:00:56.028Z","text_content":"A company that carries $100 million in debt and $50 million in $BTC   is definitely not a “Bitcoin play.”  What it is is a leveraged operator with a volatile asset that sits in its books, among other, more or less volatile assets.

Bitcoin’s surge to $120K followed by sharp corrections reflected the volatility of the space, but innovation and adoption surged across the board. Now, all eyes are on $XRP  , as two major forces could make 2026 its breakout year.   *: Regulatory Clarity Fuels Confidence Ripple’s legal battles with U.S. regulators have largely settled, bringing long awaited clarity to XRP’s status.   This has opened doors for spot XRP ETFs, which are already attracting significant institutional inflows.   With clearer rules, XRP is now accessible to a broader range of investors, reducing uncertainty and boosting market confidence.   * : Institutional Adoption Accelerates The launch of the Canary XRP ETF in late 2025 pulled in $250 million in its first few days, signaling strong institutional interest.   Ripple’s expanding partnerships and real world use cases are increasing the utility of the XRP Ledger, especially in cross border payments.   Analysts predict XRP could reach $5.50 by year end 2026, driven by this adoption wave.   Market volatility and competition from stablecoins could limit upside.   Some analysts remain cautious, forecasting a potential dip to $1 if momentum stalls.   XRP’s price remains range bound in the $2, $2.50 zone as of late 2025.   With regulatory clarity and institutional momentum aligning, 2026 could be XRP’s defining year. While risks remain, the foundation is set for XRP to potentially break out of its long held range and chart a prosperous new path in the evolving crypto economy. #Altcoin Season# #Macro Insights#  #XRP","gravity_id":"371701649","id":9162,"createdAt":"2025-12-06T23:30:05.186Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T02:30:07.193Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-07T00:22:00.074Z","text_content":"🤨 Ripple CEO Garlinghouse: BTC Is Going to $180K - wait, seriously?

It definitely caught the room’s attention.  He pointed mainly to U.S. regulatory progress, especially the stalled CLARITY Act, saying clearer rules could unlock a major shift in how the entire market is valued. And coming from the head of Ripple, it also hints at what $XRP  investors expect once regulatory clarity finally arrives - with BTC likely leading the way.

Only a strong divergence or clean breakout can flip the momentum. ﻿#Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"371714989","id":10254,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T14:30:05.642Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T14:40:05.231Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-07T14:35:26.464Z","text_content":"$XRP it's look great today ....","gravity_id":"371717410","id":10277,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T14:40:05.110Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T14:40:05.110Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-07T14:49:41.984Z","text_content":"$XRP you’re not bullish enough!!","gravity_id":"371717508","id":10291,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T14:50:04.808Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T15:20:06.409Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-07T14:49:22.525Z","text_content":"$XRP wtf","gravity_id":"371720150","id":10292,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T14:50:04.895Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T15:20:06.516Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-07T14:49:11.302Z","text_content":"$XRP super sale!!","gravity_id":"371718498","id":10293,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T14:50:04.980Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T15:20:06.601Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-07T14:47:03.469Z","text_content":"$XRP  Here we go again, again. ffs.","gravity_id":"371718478","id":10294,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T14:50:05.065Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T15:10:07.124Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-07T14:44:36.337Z","text_content":"$XRP I can’t believe I avoided liquidation by 0.2 cent","gravity_id":"371717475","id":10295,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T14:50:05.148Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T15:10:07.210Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-07T14:44:07.881Z","text_content":"$XRP Crash or Not ?😔🤔","gravity_id":"371719193","id":10296,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T14:50:05.231Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T15:00:05.673Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-07T14:42:49.770Z","text_content":"$XRP it’s sad that individual coins can’t move on their own.

With XRP’s institutional adoption accelerating and major financial players like BlackRock and Vanguard backing its infrastructure, the token is poised for a breakout that’s built on utility—not hype.  Market Dynamics ETF Inflows Surge: XRP-focused ETFs have seen rising demand, signaling growing interest from institutional investors.  Ripple Prime Expansion: Ripple’s institutional-grade platform is reshaping how large entities interact with crypto assets.  Infrastructure Over Speculation: Unlike past bull runs driven by retail frenzy, XRP’s 2026 outlook is grounded in real-world use cases and financial integration.  What Garlinghouse Said At Binance Blockchain Week, Garlinghouse emphasized that regulatory clarity and institutional momentum will drive the next wave of crypto growth.  He forecasted Bitcoin reaching $180K and XRP testing new highs, fueled by structural changes in global finance.  The CEO highlighted the CLARITY Act and other regulatory reforms as key catalysts for XRP’s rise.  XRP’s 2026 Outlook Price Targets: Analysts suggest XRP could break past $5.50 if institutional flows continue.  Market Structure Shift: XRP is transitioning from a speculative asset to a financial infrastructure layer, powering cross-border payments and liquidity hubs.  Investor Confidence: Backing from legacy institutions adds credibility and long-term stability to XRP’s growth narrative.  With Ripple’s CEO declaring 2026 as crypto’s breakout year, XRP is no longer just a memecoin or speculative play it’s becoming a cornerstone of institutional crypto adoption. As infrastructure solidifies and demand surges, XRP could be on the verge of its most transformative year yet. #Altcoin Season#  #BNBChain#  #XRP","gravity_id":"371718813","id":10403,"createdAt":"2025-12-07T15:40:10.968Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-07T16:00:08.707Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-07T15:34:14.002Z","text_content":"Navigating $XRP  1D’s bearish currents near key support 🌌  \r Full journal entry inside Finora AI: http://tinyurl.com/FinoraBot   \r \r The daily chart maintains a bearish tone as price remains under significant EMAs with momentum indicators favoring sellers.
