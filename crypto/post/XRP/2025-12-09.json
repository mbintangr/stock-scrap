While $BTC  dominance remains high, XRP’s slow and steady rise is catching the eye of traders watching ETF flows.  💸 ETF inflows tell the story: last week, BTC and ETH ETFs saw outflows of $87.7M and $65.5M. But $XRP  pulled in $230.7M - over 10x more than SOL, which saw $20.3M in inflows. That’s nearly $46M per day flowing into XRP.  Even more impressively, XRP ETFs haven’t had a single day of outflows since launch. All sessions showed net inflows - a rare feat that hints at consistent demand.  Many of these ETF buys happen OTC, meaning they don’t push up market price - but they do reduce circulating supply.

Citadel, Galaxy, Pantera and others joined a deal that gave them comfort from the start.  Investors secured a rare setup: the right to sell shares back to Ripple in a few years with a fixed 10% yearly return, or 25% if Ripple initiates the buyback. They also get priority in any major event, which shows how carefully this deal was structured.  And here’s the key detail many overlook - Ripple’s valuation still leans heavily on XRP. Around 90% of its net worth comes from $XRP  holdings, even after a 26% drop in 60 days. Yet Ripple still holds over $83B in XRP, well above the deal’s valuation.  #XRP  #Ripple  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"371754999","id":13437,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T21:20:06.087Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T21:40:08.211Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-08T21:26:46.974Z","text_content":"Hot take: 90% of traders lose because they trust feelings over charts.

Bitnomial has officially launched the first-ever CFTC-regulated U.S. spot market listing for XRP, making it tradable under one federal authority across spot, futures, perps and options. A complete, fully regulated product suite. No other crypto in America has this. 🔥  📌 Why this is massive:    • XRP is now approved as trading collateral - alongside Treasuries and stablecoins.   • Regulatory ambiguity? Fading fast.   • Banks, hedge funds, and institutional desks now get green-lighted access.  This isn’t just a listing. It’s XRP graduating from “high-volume token” to U.S. financial market infrastructure - with cleaner price discovery, deeper liquidity, and real institutional pathways.  In a market starving for regulatory clarity, XRP just grabbed the spotlight and walked straight into TradFi’s front door.   ❗️The big question now: Who’s next to make the leap? #XRP  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"371757044","id":13452,"createdAt":"2025-12-08T21:30:17.845Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-08T21:50:16.329Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-08T21:32:00.101Z","text_content":"📈 XRP Eyes 16% Breakout as Whales Load Up  XRP is once again testing the $2 support - a level that’s held $XRP  strong multiple times this year. Each dip to this zone brings buyers back in, and this time is no different.  Whale activity is rising, ETF inflows remain steady, and XRP is moving in a tight range. Top analyst Ali Martinez believes this setup could trigger a 16% move to the upside.  📊 XRP just bounced from $2.00 to $2.08 with volume jumping 77.5% - while $BTC , ETH, and SOL saw both price and volume decline. That divergence hints at quiet accumulation before a potential breakout.  Martinez highlights a tightening symmetrical triangle, with XRP trading between $2.03 and $2.18.
