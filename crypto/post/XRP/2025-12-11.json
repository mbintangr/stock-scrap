Suddenly, XRP is the third-largest holding after Bitcoin and Ethereum, making up 5.17% of the entire fund. It’s one of those moments where you think: “Yep… institutions are finally paying attention.”  The timing couldn’t be better. U.S. spot XRP ETFs just crossed $1B AUM, second only to Ethereum’s pace, and Brad Garlinghouse says interest from the TradFi crowd is accelerating. Price-wise, XRP is still chilling in the mid-$2 range, but traders are eyeing a breakout above $2.22–$2.30 as the next real signal.  Meanwhile, $BTC  continues battling macro pressure - but with institutional demand rising, XRP might finally have the tailwind it’s been waiting for.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #XRP   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"371823012","id":18129,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T21:30:05.287Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T22:20:08.717Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-10T21:23:54.917Z","text_content":"$XRPj What is the real purpose.","gravity_id":"371825173","id":18137,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T21:30:07.194Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T22:10:07.674Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-10T21:23:26.725Z","text_content":"$XRP I wonder what is the real reason for creating XRP?","gravity_id":"371825171","id":18138,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T21:30:07.339Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T22:00:08.376Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-10T21:22:14.053Z","text_content":"$XRP They manipulate the market.","gravity_id":"371819993","id":18139,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T21:30:07.533Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T22:00:08.497Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-10T21:30:23.810Z","text_content":"$XRP$5 to $6 would be a fair price","gravity_id":"371822074","id":18157,"createdAt":"2025-12-10T21:40:06.445Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T22:20:08.576Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-10T21:43:45.068Z","text_content":"Is the Next 100x Crypto Finally Here?

Despite recent setbacks, momentum could shift in $XRP  ’s favor if buying pressure returns.  Market Highlights Current Resistance: $2.10 remains a key barrier.  Performance Stats (CoinGecko):  24h: +2%  7d: -5%  14d: -4%  30d: -15.3%  Since Dec 2024: -3.7%  Yearly High: XRP breached  $3 for the first time in seven years earlier in 2025.  Why It Matters Psychological Level: $3 is a critical milestone for investor sentiment.  Market Context: Broader downtrend has weighed on XRP’s momentum.  Resilience: Despite losses, XRP continues to attract strong retail and institutional interest.  Outlook Bullish Scenario: A breakout above $2.10 could open the path toward $3.  Bearish Risk: Failure to hold support may extend the correction.  Key Watchpoints: Volume inflows and ETF demand could be catalysts for recovery.   XRP is currently struggling at $2.10 resistance, but its earlier rally to $3 shows the asset’s potential. If momentum returns, XRP could reclaim the $3 mark in the near future, making this a critical level to watch for traders and investors alike. #Meme Alpha#  #BNBChain#  #XRP","gravity_id":"371836054","id":18926,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T05:50:07.890Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T06:00:10.187Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-11T06:09:57.620Z","text_content":"$XRP nice gambling token, the new casino.

Selling pressure increased, and the pair fell below the $2.10 and $2.05 resistance levels. The $2.00 support level was also broken downwards during the day. The XRP price dropped to the $1,993 level. Due to weak risk appetite across the cryptocurrency market, XRP struggled to survive in the critical support zone. How Did the Short-Term XRP Landscape Shape Up?  With the recent decline, XRP traded below $2.05 and the 100-hour simple moving average. The price remained below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the decline from the $2,177 peak to the $1,993 low. A distinct downtrend line extending around $2.05 was present on the charts. This level emerged as the first serious barrier for the bulls.  In the event of a potential rebound, the first short-term resistance formed in the $2.03-$2.04 band. Subsequently, $2.05 and the aforementioned trend line became a critical area on the hourly chart. If an hourly close occurs above $2.05, the price appears to be gaining momentum towards the 50% Fibonacci retracement zone at $2,085. Resistances and Possible Upside Scenario  In the scenario where a breakout above $2,085 occurs, $2.10 will emerge as a key resistance. After breaking above the $2.10 barrier, the $2.15 and $2.185 targets will come into play. If the bulls gain strength, the $2.22 region will act as a new short-term upper limit.","gravity_id":"371837758","id":19194,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T08:30:07.199Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T09:10:08.320Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-11T08:30:00.160Z","text_content":"$XRP  Price to $1000?

With XRP down 3.6% this year, community commentator Zach Rector recently claimed factors such as the late resolution of the SEC case, late launch of XRP ETFs and the delays with the Clarity Act stopped XRP from hitting its 2025 targets.  \r \r Market analysts like The Block Bull have maintained their bullish stance. In his latest analysis, The Block Bull shared what he believes may be XRP’s “realistic height” if a super cycle emerges, suggesting the token could reach $48.  \r \r \r Notably, the market watcher called attention to a parallel channel that has guided XRP’s price action since 2017. For context, XRP started retesting the upper trendline of this channel in mid-2017 when its price continued to hover around $0.005 to $0.008. Each time it retested the upper trendline, it found solid support until the price eventually surged to the $3.31 peak in January 2018.  \r \r \r The downturn that followed eventually pushed XRP below the upper trendline and inside the channel in late 2018. XRP remained within the parallel ascending channel, as it saw gradual price uptrend despite persistent struggles. Nonetheless, the 2022 bear market, exacerbated by the Terra and FTX implosions, led to a drop below the lower trendline of the channel.  \r \r With this, XRP lost the support at the lower end of the channel in 2022 and has continued to trade below the channel since then. However, the November 2024 surge to $2 allowed the price to start retesting the lower trendline, but XRP has faced persistent resistance at this level, failing to break into the channel.  The Block Bull believes XRP has the potential to re-enter the channel, which would lead the price to greater heights. According to the analyst, XRP’s realistic height if the crypto asset slips into a super cycle rests around the $48 mark, which sits at the edge of the channel’s upper trendline. “Parallel Channel gives you greater targets to obtain,” The Block Bull said.","gravity_id":"371843830","id":19786,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T14:30:06.884Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T15:00:08.449Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-11T14:10:00.181Z","text_content":"💰 60% of wealthy Asian investors hold crypto  Survey indicates that six in ten wealthy Asian investors have cryptocurrency holdings in their portfolios.  #Investors  #Asia  #Crypto  #Survey  #Markets  $XRP    https://crypto-economy.com/60-percent-wealthy-asian-investors-crypto/","gravity_id":"371848365","id":19787,"createdAt":"2025-12-11T14:30:07.087Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-11T15:00:08.624Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-11T13:59:40.611Z","text_content":"$XRP   price has tested patience for weeks.
