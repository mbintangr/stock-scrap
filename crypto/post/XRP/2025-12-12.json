During broader market downtrends, XRP tends to move in close alignment with BTC, mirroring its declines and maintaining a similar trajectory. This indicates that in periods of overall market weakness, XRP is still influenced by the macro-trend set by Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, when XRP experiences positive catalysts—such as favourable announcements, regulatory developments, or ecosystem wins—it demonstrates the ability to break away from BTC’s performance. The chart highlights several moments where XRP surged sharply despite Bitcoin showing only modest strength or even moving sideways. These spikes show that XRP can generate independent momentum when driven by project-specific news.\n\nIn short, XRP behaves like BTC during downturns, but outperforms and decouples during periods of positive XRP-focused news—showing clear signs of fundamental-driven rallies.\n\nGood news and more good news is all we need!","gravity_id":"371864933","id":20988,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T03:30:07.889Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T04:50:08.838Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-12T03:48:38.307Z","text_content":"$XRP   The market has been swinging in every direction lately, but that hasn’t stopped people from finding smart opportunities.
