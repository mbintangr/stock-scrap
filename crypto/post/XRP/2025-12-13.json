Now its liquidity can be used in foreign #DeFi   protocols — for farming, trading, and providing liquidity.  \r \r Key points:\r \r - Secure: Every wXRP is backed by real XRP held in accounts with the licensed -custodian (Hex Trust).\r \r - Tech-driven: Uses the OFT standard from LayerZero for smooth cross-chain transfers.\r \r - Launches with liquidity: Planned launch with a TVL >$100M.  \r \r This opens up new trading pairs, especially with Ripple's upcoming stablecoin (RLUSD), and gives XRP access to high yields in trending ecosystems.  \r \r Why is this needed? So that XRP doesn't remain isolated but becomes a competitor in the multichain world. The timing coincides with a major XRPL 3.0.0 update — the team is clearly aiming for growth.  \r \r Question for you: Do you think this could be a trigger for a new XRP rally, or has the market already priced in such developments?  #XRPLedger  #stablecoin","gravity_id":"371892063","id":23054,"createdAt":"2025-12-12T23:10:08.713Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T23:30:09.328Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-12T23:16:25.298Z","text_content":"#XRP  $XRP   I was asked to provide an update on this asset, but nothing significant has changed since the previous analysis.

That strong green candle you’re seeing shows momentum expansion, not just a wick-based move.\n\nAs long as price holds above the recent breakout zone, the structure stays bullish. Any shallow pullback into support can be healthy, but losing that level would slow things down.\n\nFor now, trend is up, momentum is positive, and patience is key.\nLet the chart confirm the next move before reacting.","gravity_id":"371898506","id":23393,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T05:20:07.231Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T06:10:09.694Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-13T05:10:09.343Z","text_content":"$XRP breakout","gravity_id":"371898490","id":23394,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T05:20:07.439Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T06:10:09.933Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-13T05:08:31.360Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $XRP","gravity_id":"371897767","id":23395,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T05:20:07.585Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T05:50:11.532Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-13T05:27:51.975Z","text_content":"You spent 3 hours on TradingView this saturday.

The outlook remains cautiously bullish if price clears these zones with conviction, while failure to hold above 1.99 could lead to further downside pressure.  \r \r The primary resistance lies near 2.05, with critical support around 1.99 acting as a pivot for directional bias. A decisive break above 2.08 accompanied by volume could confirm bullish momentum. Conversely, a drop below 1.99 may expose the price to additional declines toward 1.97. This briefing is summarized.

I Looked at the One Thing That Actually Matters  I keep seeing wild calls about $XRP  hitting $1,000, so I decided to zoom out and look at the math. At around $2, XRP already sits near a $125B market cap - even matching Bitcoin’s size would only put it closer to $30. That doesn’t kill the story, but it changes how serious investors think about upside.  What really stuck with me was Franklin Templeton’s take: XRP’s future isn’t about hype, it’s about payments. Ripple wants XRP to become the “plumbing” behind global money movement - fast, cheap, invisible to users.  But here’s the key question most people ignore 👇 Does real economic activity flow back into the token? If XRP captures value from payments at scale, upside grows. If not, price stays grounded. In the long run, adoption - not predictions - will decide where XRP lands.  #XRP  #XRPETF  #BTC Price Analysis#   #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"371905213","id":23976,"createdAt":"2025-12-13T11:40:08.922Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-13T12:20:09.159Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-13T11:30:00.379Z","text_content":"$XRP  reserves on Binance just dropped to ~2.6B XRP: The lowest level since 2024.
