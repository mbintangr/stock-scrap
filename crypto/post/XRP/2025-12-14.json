Each wXRP is minted only after the equivalent native $XRP is deposited into Hex Trust’s regulated, segregated custody and is burned on redemption, enabling users and institutions to freely move value into Solana DeFi while retaining on-chain redeemability to XRPL. LayerZero’s OFT standard powers secure cross-chain transfers (reducing reliance on risky bridges) and supports expansion to other chains (Ethereum, Optimism, HyperEVM, etc.), widening XRP’s DeFi footprint and creating deeper liquidity pairs (including potential RLUSD trading). Expect this to speed on-chain settlement, improve pricing depth for XRP liquidity in DeFi, and make institutional participation easier due to KYC/regulated custody.
