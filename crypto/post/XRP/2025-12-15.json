The firm monitors social interest across Telegram, Discord, subreddits, and X through its Sanbase analytics platform.   Spot $XRP  exchange-traded funds continued their positive flow streak with over $20.1 million recorded Friday, marking 19 consecutive days of net #inflows  according to crypto research platform SoSoValue. The ongoing influx pushed cumulative total inflows to nearly $974.5 million, with total assets under management reaching approximately $1.18 billion.   $XRP  has drifted between $1.99 and $2.17 over the last seven days, trading hands at $2.03 on Saturday. Santiment stated that bulls and bears continue to battle as the asset hangs onto $2 market value with #bullishness  showing across social media channels.   Nov. 14 remains the strongest day for $XRP  ETF inflows with over $243 million, while Nov. 18 saw the second-highest intake with $164 million since then. Giannis Andreou, founder and CEO of #crypto  miner Bitmern Mining, said in an X post at the start of the week that Wall Street has not stopped buying. He speculates this represents the kind of accumulation typically seen before a narrative shift in market positioning.   #Ripple  received approval for a national trust bank charter from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Friday, alongside stablecoin issuer Circle. BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Paxos also simultaneously received green lights to convert existing state-level trust companies into federally chartered national trust banks.

On one side, XRP-linked ETFs are recording consistent inflows, signaling growing institutional interest. On the other hand, XRP’s spot price is sliding, leaving many investors wondering: Shouldn’t ETF demand push prices higher?  The answer lies in understanding how crypto markets actually react to liquidity, sentiment, and structure, rather than just focusing on the headlines.  ETF inflows are undoubtedly a bullish long-term signal. They reflect institutional confidence, regulatory clarity, and growing adoption. However, ETF capital does not always translate into instant buying pressure in the spot market. In many cases, ETF issuers use structured settlement mechanisms, delayed spot purchases, or existing inventory. This means the price impact of inflows can lag behind the announcement by days or even weeks. As a result, ETF demand can coexist with short-term price weakness.  From a technical standpoint, XRP has struggled to break above key resistance zones decisively. Repeated rejections at these levels weaken bullish momentum and encourage sellers to step in. At the same time, a portion of XRP holders remains underwater from previous cycles. When prices decline, these participants may sell to reduce exposure, adding further pressure to the downside.  XRP’s decline highlights that the price does not always move in sync with bullish news. #Market  structure, #Macro  conditions, and trader behavior often dominate short-term trends.  For long-term investors, ETF inflows signal growing legitimacy and demand. For short-term traders, volatility remains part of the game. Understanding the difference between the two is key to navigating moments like this.","gravity_id":"371964713","id":27932,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T12:10:08.993Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T12:20:09.909Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-15T12:19:49.509Z","text_content":"$XRP Ripple is building a full end to end payments stack:\n\n\n– Treasury\n– Stablecoin payments\n– Custody\n– Liquidity\n\n\nThrough strategic acquisitions, nearly $4B has been invested to build regulated, institutional grade financial infrastructure at global scale.","gravity_id":"371961388","id":27946,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T12:20:09.047Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T12:50:10.461Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-15T12:13:45.042Z","text_content":"Analyst: XRP Must Hold This Key Level to Avoid Crashing Toward $1.20\n\n#Ripple #XRP $XRP\nhttps://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-must-hold-this-key-level-to-avoid-crashing-toward-1-20/","gravity_id":"371961339","id":27947,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T12:20:09.324Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T12:50:10.652Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-15T12:10:43.099Z","text_content":"$XRP Guys, we all know that we are going to have an alcoin season.

Historically, when the EMA ribbon flips downward and price trades below it, XRP often enters prolonged drawdowns rather than brief corrections. Past cycles have seen declines ranging from 27% to 66%, lasting several months.

While most altcoins have struggled to absorb positive news in 2025, XRP’s ability to repeatedly defend this level highlights strong holder conviction and structural demand.  The catalyst: Ripple has received conditional approval from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to launch Ripple National Trust Bank. This places Ripple under direct federal banking oversight, alongside NYDFS compliance. Structurally, this is a major shift - Ripple is no longer just a crypto payments company, but part of regulated financial infrastructure.  From a tokenomics and utility standpoint, this strengthens the long-term thesis for XRP as a compliant settlement asset, connecting fiat rails, RLUSD, and future tokenized assets. However, markets remain slow to reprice fundamentals until usage metrics, liquidity flows, and balance sheet demand become visible 📊.  Technically, XRP is locked in a 2025 consolidation range. Buyers consistently defend $2, while upside attempts fail to attract sustained momentum - a classic sign of distribution over accumulation in a risk-off environment. If sentiment deteriorates, a loss of $2 could open downside toward $1.20. Conversely, renewed risk appetite could rapidly close the gap between fundamentals and price.  For now, XRP sits at a pivotal inflection point: fundamentals are accelerating, price is waiting, and sentiment remains the deciding factor  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"371965514","id":28163,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T14:20:19.894Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T14:40:09.736Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-15T14:02:52.460Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $XRP","gravity_id":"371965485","id":28164,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T14:20:20.165Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T14:30:09.940Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-15T14:02:50.362Z","text_content":"I’m bearish on $XRP","gravity_id":"371965484","id":28165,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T14:20:20.443Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T14:30:10.214Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-15T14:02:47.196Z","text_content":"I’m bullish on $XRP","gravity_id":"371965483","id":28166,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T14:20:20.720Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T14:30:10.400Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-15T14:02:34.249Z","text_content":"🚨 Analyst Warns: You Might Be Underpricing $XRP  🚨 According to recent analysis, XRP's true potential could be far higher than many think.

Let's do the math! 👇\n\n📊 Current Status (Dec/2025):\n    • Circulating Supply: ~60.5 Billion XRP\n    • Current Price: ~$2.00\n    • Current Market Cap: ~$121 Billion\n\n💰 For XRP to hit $589: We would need to multiply the current market cap by nearly 300x. The required Market Cap would be: ~$35.6 TRILLION. 🤯\n\n🌍 The Ultimate Comparison: Today, the Total Market Cap of GOLD sits around $30 Trillion (with the ounce at +$4,300). Basically, for XRP to reach $589, it doesn't just need to pump... it needs to become more valuable than all the gold in the world.\n\n🗣 I want to hear from you:\n\nDo you think the utility of the XRP Ledger (tokenizing real-world assets) gives it enough power to eventually \"flip\" Gold?\n\nHow many years do you think it would take to get there? 10 years? 20 years? Or never? 👇 Let me know below!","gravity_id":"371967910","id":28451,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T15:50:07.589Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T15:50:07.589Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-15T15:42:53.808Z","text_content":"$XRP  has cleared out downside liquidity, and funding rates across major exchanges have now flipped negative a clear sign that shorts are piling in heavily.
