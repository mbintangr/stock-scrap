Historic Rally: Ripple’s $XRP   faced years of pressure from the SEC lawsuit filed in December 2020, limiting momentum even during the 2021 bull run. However, by late 2024, sentiment shifted dramatically. Following Donald Trump’s victory in the 47th U.S. Presidential election, expectations grew that the SEC vs. Ripple case could be resolved.  Between November 2024 and January 2025, XRP surged from $0.50 to over $3, marking a 500% rally in just three months.  Current Landscape:  XRP trades well below its January 2025 highs.  Regulatory clarity remains the key driver of institutional adoption.  Market sentiment is cautious, but improved compliance frameworks could reignite momentum.  Can It Repeat? For XRP to replicate its late 2024 rally, several factors must align:  Resolution of regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ripple.  Institutional adoption through custody and settlement services.  A supportive macro environment for risk assets.  Outlook: While another 500% surge in such a short window is ambitious, regulatory breakthroughs and institutional demand could set the stage for renewed upside in XRP. #BNBChain#  #Altcoin Season#  #XRP","gravity_id":"371978136","id":29076,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T20:30:08.987Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T21:00:09.740Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-15T20:26:26.326Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $XRP","gravity_id":"371975758","id":29077,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T20:30:09.255Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T21:00:09.937Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-15T20:25:45.143Z","text_content":"Can we get 100 likes on the three letters below?\n.\n.\n.\nXRP","gravity_id":"371976485","id":29078,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T20:30:09.530Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T21:00:10.115Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-15T20:25:45.085Z","text_content":"Holding XRP memes bags has felt like dis ","gravity_id":"371980046","id":29079,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T20:30:09.892Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T21:00:10.602Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-15T20:25:45.084Z","text_content":"When XRP went from $3.50 to $3 we was so pissed off\n\nNow we’d be happy with a pump to $2.20\n\nThis game is a mind fck 🤣","gravity_id":"371976482","id":29080,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T20:30:10.165Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T21:00:10.802Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-15T20:25:45.082Z","text_content":"Loading up on more XRP memes right here.","gravity_id":"371976481","id":29081,"createdAt":"2025-12-15T20:30:10.352Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-15T20:50:10.398Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-15T20:20:56.963Z","text_content":"$XRP Just going to sit back and wait 2-3 years as there is no real momentum in Crypto.

One major factor is a sharp rise in trading volume, with 24-hour volume climbing nearly 98% to $3.74 billion. Such spikes often signal profit-taking, especially after recent upward price movements.  Supply dynamics also influence sentiment. XRP has a circulating supply of 60.49 billion tokens out of a maximum supply of 100 billion, resulting in a higher fully diluted valuation of $187.19 billion compared to its $113.2 billion market cap. This valuation gap can contribute to cautious behavior among traders.  Despite today’s dip, XRP remains ranked by market capitalization, supported by strong liquidity and a large holder base.

Lately, it’s hard to keep up with the crypto news - BTC drops to $85K, while WBT Coin is hitting new all-time highs. But here’s where it gets interesting: $XRP  whales are disappearing, and with it, over 1.18 billion XRP sold in just 4 weeks.   📌 What happened? XRP wallets holding 1-100 million XRP have been selling off, dropping their holdings from 4.8 billion XRP to 3.62 billion XRP between November 2025 and December 2025. The market’s moving fast, and the pressure is clear as XRP failed to stay above $2. A steady decline in whale holdings is leaving the market vulnerable to further drops.   🔄 With whales stepping back, who will absorb this extra supply? The market’s uncertainty is evident, and without fresh demand, XRP could see more downside if liquidity doesn't pick up.   Spotters, which price zone do you think XRP and BTC will land in next? $85K for BTC seems like the tipping point, but what about XRP? Is it time to buy the dip, or is there more to come? Let me know your thoughts! 👇 #XRP  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372003182","id":30932,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T15:50:08.575Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T17:00:10.616Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-16T15:58:45.090Z","text_content":"How much XRP is needed to retire?🤔","gravity_id":"372005114","id":30946,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T16:00:11.725Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T17:00:10.202Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-16T16:13:45.063Z","text_content":"🗞 Top #CryptoNews: Tue, Dec 16 (24H)\n\n1️⃣ XRP price falls under $2 after one 7-year-old wallet triggers a massive $721 million sell-off\n\n2️⃣ Bitcoin ETFs are 60% underwater, creating a $100 billion distressed house of cards \n\nhttps://cryptoslate.com/top-news/","gravity_id":"372003405","id":30985,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T16:20:08.211Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T17:00:09.708Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-16T16:16:45.051Z","text_content":"What price $XRP do you want for Christmas?","gravity_id":"372005248","id":30986,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T16:20:09.035Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T17:10:11.555Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-16T16:10:00.104Z","text_content":"⚖️ Wyoming digital bank sues Fed  The Wyoming-based digital bank filed a lawsuit after the Federal Reserve denied its request for an account, escalating a regulatory dispute.  #Wyoming  #DigitalBanking  #Regulation  $XRP    https://crypto-economy.com/wyoming-digital-bank-challenges-fed-account-denial-in-court/","gravity_id":"372005186","id":30987,"createdAt":"2025-12-16T16:20:09.668Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T17:00:09.898Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-16T16:26:05.724Z","text_content":"$XRP Let's see if this is a real bull run for crypto and specially XRP.
