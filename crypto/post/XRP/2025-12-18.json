Teucrium Trading CEO Sal Gilbertie said the choice was natural - after years in commodities and derivatives, XRP stood out as a digital asset with a clear use case.  Being first mattered. In the ETF world, early launches often dominate, and the “XXRP” ticker made the product instantly recognizable for investors.  📊 The response was striking. The fund crossed $500M in assets under management in just 12 weeks. For comparison, most ETFs aim for $25M - and many never reach that level at all.  Despite recent price weakness, Gilbertie says the XRP ETF story is just beginning. Clearer U.S. regulation could unlock the next wave of demand.  In his view, $BTC  still plays the role of digital gold, while assets like XRP earn attention through real-world utility - especially in payments.

Markets are watching the Bank of Japan this week, as another rate hike could ripple through risk assets - including BTC and $XRP .  📌 Here’s why it matters. For years, Japan’s ultra-low rates powered the yen carry trade: borrow cheap yen, deploy capital into stocks, crypto, and anything with yield. When rates go up, that trade gets unwound - and risk assets feel it.  We’ve seen this movie before. In March 2024, when Japan exited negative rates, Bitcoin stayed calm at first… then dropped nearly $20K over the following weeks. Similar patterns followed the July 2024 and January 2025 hikes, with $BTC  sliding 10–30% before finding a floor.📊  So if volatility picks up, it wouldn’t be a shock. Sometimes the macro move hits crypto after the headlines - just as bears finish their coffee   This week isn’t about panic.

Key trend levels have failed to reclaim momentum, and price action continues to respect lower highs and weak demand zones. Unless a strong fundamental catalyst (macro, geopolitical, or liquidity-driven) enters the picture, the probability favors further downside in the near term.  Regarding XRP, despite my personal long-term confidence in the project, the technical setup allows for a continuation move toward the $1.00 area. This zone aligns with a major historical support and previous high-volume accumulation range. If price reaches that level, it would likely represent a more favorable risk–reward area for gradual accumulation, rather than chasing strength at higher levels.  At this stage, the market appears to be in a distribution-to-capitulation transition, where patience and capital preservation matter more than early positioning.

On the technical side, the MACD shows the blue line crossing below the red signal line, with a slightly negative histogram, reflecting increasing bearish momentum. Meanwhile, the RSI hovers around 37, indicating that the downtrend still dominates, though $XRP   has not yet reached oversold territory.  Structurally, the descending trendline from the 3.09 USD peak continues to cap recovery attempts, with a key resistance zone at 2.09 USD. A decisive daily close above this level could open the way for $XRP   to test the 50-day EMA at 2.18 USD.  Downside support is provided by the uptrend from 1.45 USD, with 1.87 USD serving as a critical level. A break below this zone could intensify selling pressure, while holding above it may allow $XRP   to retest the broader descending trendline near 2.52 USD.
