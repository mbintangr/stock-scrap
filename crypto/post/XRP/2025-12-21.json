Market Snapshot: Ripple’s native token $XRP   is gaining traction as one of the most trending cryptocurrencies, fueled by growing anticipation around crypto ETF launches. Currently trading at $1.80, XRP is attempting to break out of its low range and reclaim bullish momentum.  Key Catalysts:  XRP sits at the center of the rising ETF narrative, with multiple XRP focused ETFs expected to launch.  Investor sentiment is building around the possibility of XRP crossing the $10 mark, with some analysts projecting a move toward $12.  Market momentum remains cautious, but ETF inflows could act as a major trigger for upside.  Price Outlook:  Short-term resistance: $2.00 – $2.50  Mid-term target: $6.00 – $8.00  Long-term projection: $10 – $12, contingent on ETF approval and institutional demand  Investor Watch: XRP’s ability to capitalize on ETF hype and break above key resistance levels will determine whether it can claim the $12 target in 2026.
