This time, XRP is behaving differently, continuing to see daily inflows even as the broader market weakens. 👀  McClurg pointed to infrastructure growth rather than price momentum as the key driver. XRP-linked ETFs have already crossed $1B in assets, far above the $5M AUM many ETFs consider a strong first-year result.

On the 4H chart, $XRP  remains in a downtrend since early December, trading below the descending EMA ribbon and near the lower Bollinger Band around 1.9275–1.9355 USDT. Recent price action features a small green candle bounce from lows near 1.9275, with volume moderate and buy pressure at 69% indicating solid accumulation and defensive buying at these levels.  The structure stays bearish with lower highs intact, but Bollinger Bands are narrowing slightly — suggesting reduced volatility and potential for consolidation or an impending upside move.

Institutions are steadily adding exposure through spot $XRP  ETFs, pushing total assets past $1.2B. No hype, no volatility  just consistent accumulation.  Whales are also increasing their share again, especially wallets holding 100M–1B XRP, a sign of confidence after the recent dip.

John Squire, an XRP community figure and Uphold affiliate partner, believes that XRP may become an opportunity many investors only appreciate after it has already passed them by.  He shared this view in a recent tweet. It joins a growing chorus of XRP advocates who believe the market is underestimating.  Today, XRP continues to trade below key psychological levels. It has been hovering around the $2 mark amid weeks of subdued performance. The token remains 45% below its previous highs, even as Ripple records regulatory and institutional milestones that did not exist during XRP’s last major bull cycle.  For critics, this lack of immediate price reaction signals weak demand. For supporters like Squire, it highlights a market focusing on short-term price movement rather than the long term.  This same argument has been echoed by longtime XRP commentator Coach JV, who has repeatedly said XRP could become “the greatest missed opportunity of our lifetime” if investors fail to recognize what is changing beneath the surface.","gravity_id":"372197234","id":43606,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T15:00:10.853Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-22T15:00:10.853Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-22T15:38:10.193Z","text_content":"$XRP california wake up 🤠","gravity_id":"372198535","id":43632,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T15:40:08.382Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-22T16:20:12.325Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-22T15:31:06.448Z","text_content":"$XRP  has moved through a full cycle of distribution and downside expansion, followed by a liquidity sweep, and is now holding above a historically significant demand area.\nDownward momentum is clearly weakening, price action is compressing, and this phase typically marks early accumulation by informed participants rather than emotional selling.","gravity_id":"372200001","id":43633,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T15:40:08.613Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-22T16:10:11.633Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-22T15:29:00.067Z","text_content":"$XRP  has already completed its distribution → downtrend → liquidity grab and is now stabilizing at a key historical demand zone.
