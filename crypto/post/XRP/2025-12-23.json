The chart reflects a sequence of lower highs and lower lows, indicating sellers are still in control. The recent sharp drop followed by weak sideways consolidation suggests distribution rather than accumulation. As long as price remains below the broken support zone near 1.90, upside attempts are likely to face selling pressure, making pullbacks a potential opportunity for continuation to the downside.\n\n\nFrom a trade perspective, the short setup looks more favorable unless buyers reclaim key resistance with strong momentum. A rejection near 1.89–1.90 can offer a clean short entry, targeting the liquidity zone around 1.86 and potentially extending toward 1.83 if selling pressure accelerates. On the flip side, if price holds above 1.87 and reclaims 1.90 with acceptance, a quick long scalp toward 1.94–1.95 is possible, but it remains counter-trend and higher risk compared to shorts.\n\n\nShort Outlook: Bias remains bearish below 1.90; expect continuation toward lower support unless a strong bullish reclaim changes structure.","gravity_id":"372218737","id":45087,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T08:50:10.721Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T09:10:11.688Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-23T08:45:34.528Z","text_content":"Ripple is consolidating within a bullish pennant on the daily chart.\r The pattern suggests potential for a significant upward move.  \r A confirmed breakout could propel $XRP  towards $5.00🎯  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372218698","id":45088,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T08:50:11.099Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T09:10:12.068Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-23T08:44:36.801Z","text_content":"JUST IN: ETF clients buy $43.89 million worth of $XRP , bringing total ETF-held net assets to $1.25 billion.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372219186","id":45089,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T08:50:11.511Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T09:10:12.444Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-23T08:44:25.745Z","text_content":"[{\"sourceId\":\"694a559f15394169908cec24\",\"tldr\":\"Ripple's 2025 lawsuit resolution brings regulatory clarity, boosting XRP's adoption and solidifying its market presence.\",\"url\":\"https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-xrp/\",\"relevantWord\":\"Ripple's 2025 lawsuit resolution\",\"score\":\"8.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"694a558615394169908cebd9\",\"tldr\":\"XRP holders can now earn yield through a new on-ledger lending protocol directly on the XRPL, enhancing utility and engagement with the XRP ecosystem.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/694a403cbd7deb5d7c66cccd\",\"relevantWord\":\"XRP holders can now earn yield\",\"score\":\"8.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"694a558415394169908cebcf\",\"tldr\":\"XRP ETFs reach $1.21 billion in assets, reflecting strong institutional demand and highlighting a growing interest in regulated cryptocurrency investments.\",\"url\":\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/694a322da780693578e1f6d5\",\"relevantWord\":\"XRP ETFs reach $1.21 billion\",\"score\":\"8.0\"}]","gravity_id":"372218654","id":45090,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T08:50:11.886Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T09:00:12.863Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-23T08:44:02.651Z","text_content":"$XRP  HowTOAD,BNB","gravity_id":"372218637","id":45091,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T08:50:12.137Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T09:00:13.122Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-23T08:38:12.487Z","text_content":"🚨 JUST IN: #Ripple  CTO David Schwartz says $XRP  Ledger adoption is measured by transaction volume and liquidity, not price, as the #XRPL  has processed over four billion transactions and sees growing institutional use.","gravity_id":"372219080","id":45092,"createdAt":"2025-12-23T08:50:12.904Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T09:00:13.870Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-23T09:08:20.914Z","text_content":"🇺🇸 #ETF  FLOWS: ETH, SOL, and XRP spot ETFs saw net inflows on Dec. 22, while BTC spot ETFs saw net outflows.
