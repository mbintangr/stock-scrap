BlockBeats Note: Liquidation charts do not display the exact number or value of contracts at risk of liquidation. Instead, the bars represent the **relative importance** of each liquidation cluster compared to neighboring clusters—defined as \"intensity.\" This means the chart shows how strongly the underlying asset’s price will react when it hits a specific level. A taller \"liquidation bar\" signals a more intense response once the price reaches that threshold, driven by a liquidity frenzy.  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  $XRP","gravity_id":"372323825","id":52065,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T09:10:06.982Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:00:08.132Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:12:37.559Z","text_content":"$XRP\n\nBuy the dip !!","gravity_id":"372323934","id":52079,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T09:20:07.374Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:20:08.775Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:25:45.107Z","text_content":"$XRP is showing renewed momentum toward the $2 level, with its price closely watched as multi-year structural patterns and concentrated liquidity zones may influence short-term gains.\n\nShow more > https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/xrp-price-prediction-xrp-approaches-2-upswing-as-macro-triangle-and-liquidity-clusters-signal-short-term-rally?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=bravenewcoin&utm_content=bncnewsocialpush ","gravity_id":"372325034","id":52091,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T09:30:07.603Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:20:08.364Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:22:23.100Z","text_content":"⚡️FLARE LAUNCHES XRP YIELD PRODUCT  $FLR   has launched earn XRP, enabling FXRP holders to earn on-chain yield paid and compounded in $XRP  , without selling or complex DeFi exposure. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372324593","id":52092,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T09:30:07.772Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:20:08.568Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:37:45.079Z","text_content":"Crypto Market Shift Threatens XRP and Cardano, Says Novogratz \n-   https://coinfomania.com/crypto-market-shift-threatens-xrp-and-cardano-says-novogratz/ ","gravity_id":"372325147","id":52107,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T09:40:07.128Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:20:08.090Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:34:37.898Z","text_content":"$XRP  remains capped below falling EMAs as volatility compresses, with price boxed between $1.80 support and $1.90 resistance.  🔹 With derivatives activity cooling and bands tightening, is this compression a liquidity reset before a decisive move away from the $2.00 trend ceiling? ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#   ﻿#BNBChain#","gravity_id":"372325117","id":52108,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T09:40:07.341Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:20:08.218Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:48:36.239Z","text_content":"$XRP a friend of mine asked me the other day; XRP price is not moving up and it is stuck where it is for months now, why dont you sell?\n\n\nAnd my answer was; I would sell my own teeth and not selling any of my XRPs\n\n\nActually I’m buying more and I will keep doing it","gravity_id":"372324810","id":52120,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T09:50:07.726Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:20:07.735Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-27T09:46:20.372Z","text_content":"BREAKING:\n\nVISA SAYS CRYPTO OFFICIALLY WENT “MAINSTREAM” IN 2025.\n $XRP","gravity_id":"372324785","id":52121,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T09:50:07.934Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T10:20:07.943Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-27T10:04:25.408Z","text_content":"UPDATE: 📉 $XRP  hovers near $1 .85 as US Strategic Crypto Reserve discussions continue.

Leverage has flushed out, reducing liquidation risk and shifting the market back toward spot-driven demand.  Historically, these low-OI phases mark transitions, not tops. With XRP holding a higher low and bulls eyeing a reclaim above $2, the setup is starting to look constructive again. ﻿#Altcoin Season#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372328651","id":52345,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T12:30:07.728Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T12:50:08.954Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-27T12:35:48.393Z","text_content":"$XRP  Back Under Pressure 📉  Currently at $1.84 – Is this the bottom, or is more downside ahead? 🤔","gravity_id":"372326698","id":52360,"createdAt":"2025-12-27T12:40:07.177Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-27T13:20:08.995Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-27T12:44:04.224Z","text_content":"XRP’s heatmap highlights leverage concentrated above price, signaling hidden pressure in the derivatives market.

Instead, they accumulate discreetly, splitting large orders into smaller, strategic trades (iceberging) to avoid driving the price higher too quickly.\n\nThis approach allows them to absorb substantial selling pressure without triggering a major price move, creating the appearance of sideways price action while meaningful demand builds beneath the surface.
