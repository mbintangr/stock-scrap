Nansen senior research analyst Jake Kennis told Cointelegraph that conditions for #risk  assets generally should improve in the year's second half, though near-term outlook for altcoins remains modestly bearish pending $BTC  stabilization.   Kennis declined to provide specific price targets for 2026 but identified several potential catalysts including spot #ETF  approvals, integration with international payment systems, and expanded utilization as a bridge asset for cross-border #liquidity . These developments could shift momentum if implemented during the coming year.   Posidonia21 Capital Partners CEO Jesus Perez echoed expectations for range-bound price action near current levels in a constructive market scenario. $XRP  has declined 14.63% since Jan. 1, trading at $1.84 at publication time, and sits 17.03% lower over the past month according to CoinMarketCap data.   Price appreciation will likely depend more on sustained narrative strength and overall market sentiment rather than fundamental technological changes, Perez explained to Cointelegraph. Ongoing discussions about staking mechanisms have not resolved the structural limitation of lacking clear yield generation compared to competing assets.   U.S.-based spot #XRP  exchange-traded funds surpassed $1 billion in total assets earlier this month. CF Benchmarks CEO Sui Chung attributed the milestone to investor familiarity with the token, noting its extended market presence as a key advantage.   Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen recently suggested #Bitcoin 's current market conditions create challenging environments for altcoins attempting to establish new price peaks.

Key Catalysts Driving the Bull Case Regulatory clarity: SEC dropping its appeal against Ripple removes a major overhang.  ETF approval: Spot XRP ETFs are fueling institutional interest and mainstream adoption.  Institutional adoption: Ripple’s cross-border payment solutions continue to expand globally.   Price Predictions for 2026 Standard Chartered Bank: $8 target, leading the bullish outlook.  Analyst range: Forecasts vary between $2 and $8.60, reflecting different market scenarios.

Over 6M wallets hold 500 XRP or less, while a tiny number of wallets control millions or billions of XRP. As price climbs, the gap feels bigger.  To put it simply: 👉 1,000 XRP today ≈ $1,750 👉 Just a year ago ≈ $500  For retail, accumulation gets harder. For whales? Barely noticeable.  That said, not everyone agrees this is a supply issue. Around 16B XRP still sit on exchanges, liquidity moves fast, and order books can flip in seconds. No real “supply shock” here.  Crypto lawyer Bill Morgan cuts through the noise: XRP price action isn’t about escrow or supply myths — it’s still Bitcoin-led. BTC moves first, the market follows.

XRP can move to exchanges in seconds. Order books thicken and thin based on price incentives, not charts frozen in time. A real supply shock isn’t “steady accumulation” — it’s an urgent allocation imbalance (think: someone needing tens of billions now).  ETFs, escrows, custody structures matter — yes.

Prices pulled back nearly 48%, and XRP slipped into consolidation around the $1.90 zone, where patience has replaced hype as traders watch for a potential move back toward $3 in early 2026.  That kind of cycle makes one thing clear: futures trading is less about predicting the next move and more about staying in control through each phase.
