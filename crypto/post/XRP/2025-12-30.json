Even with ETF-driven demand absorbing hundreds of millions of XRP, there’s still ~16B XRP sitting liquid on exchanges. That tells you liquidity and execution matter more than headline “supply shock” narratives.  This is where infrastructure like Haust becomes relevant.  As markets get more elastic, users need systems that can:  • read real liquidity conditions, • route efficiently across venues, • and execute without slippage-driven surprises.  Haust’s intent-based DeFi is built for exactly this environment. Instead of reacting to narratives, it focuses on outcomes: smart routing, reliable execution, and AI-driven decision layers that adapt to real market depth.  In elastic markets, the edge comes from having infrastructure that understands how liquidity actually moves.","gravity_id":"372392463","id":56061,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T18:10:08.384Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T18:50:08.663Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-29T18:01:53.031Z","text_content":"XRP en RANGO es SEÑAL ALCISTA de SUBIDA $XRP    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE_kBewz2L4","gravity_id":"372389767","id":56062,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T18:10:08.617Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T18:50:08.909Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-29T18:01:41.907Z","text_content":"XRP en RANGO es SEÑAL ALCISTA de SUBIDA #XRP  $XRP  #RIPPLE   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE_kBewz2L4","gravity_id":"372391534","id":56063,"createdAt":"2025-12-29T18:10:08.860Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T18:50:09.055Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-29T18:01:00.785Z","text_content":"$XRP  remains constrained within a wider downtrend following an extended period of consolidation.  $XRP  is currently defending a major support zone, which could serve as a foundation for a potential relief bounce.

The key reason? Institutional access is finally opening at scale.  📊 Since 2024, $BTC   ETFs have already bought more Bitcoin than the network produced. Bitwise expects this trend to continue - with ETFs absorbing over 100% of new supply for BTC, ETH, and SOL.  🏦 Big names like Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and Vanguard are now allowing crypto ETFs for retail clients. That widens the demand funnel fast.  💡 $XRP  is worth watching too. Spot XRP ETFs have seen steady inflows, even while BTC funds faced outflows.

Luke Gromen still expects governments to rely on inflation and weaker currencies to deal with heavy debt loads. That core view has not changed. What has shifted is his near-term view on Bitcoin. In recent comments, he said Bitcoin looks fragile enough that a move toward the $40,000 area in 2026 is possible.  Gromen framed Bitcoin as a position that can be reduced when conditions deteriorate, rather than a holding that must always be kept at full size. In his view, gold and parts of the equity market are currently reflecting the debasement theme more cleanly than Bitcoin.  His caution rests on a small set of observable signals: Bitcoin falling behind gold, damage to long-term price trends, and renewed focus on quantum-computing risks. None of these negate the debasement thesis, but together they weaken Bitcoin’s short-term setup.  ﻿$BTC  $XRP  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372400722","id":56502,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T00:00:05.468Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T01:00:09.990Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-30T00:08:58.869Z","text_content":"⭐ I still evaluate $XRP   as a chart that is more suitable for a downtrend because it can be seen that XRP has repeatedly failed to break through resistance at the $1 .9 range.\r - According to the history of the chart, whenever the price of XRP is rejected, it usually experiences a strong correction to around $1 .8 or even lower.

Haseeb Qureshi, a managing partner at the crypto-focused venture firm Dragonfly, has released a comprehensive market outlook projecting that Bitcoin will finish 2026 above the $150,000 mark. In a detailed analysis published on December 29, 2025, Qureshi argues that while the asset may account for a smaller share of the total crypto market cap, its role as the industry’s central anchor will only be solidified by the end of next year. This forecast is rooted in the belief that the “four-year cycle” theory is dissolving in favor of a sustained institutional growth model driven by spot ETFs and corporate treasury adoption. Qureshi highlights that the current market structure is transitioning from retail-led speculation to a more durable phase where Bitcoin serves as a primary collateral asset for the global financial system  ﻿$BTC  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  $XRP","gravity_id":"372413020","id":57039,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T10:20:08.782Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T10:30:08.920Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-30T10:05:28.782Z","text_content":"$XRP   inflows are a function of regulatory clarity and steady accumulation into a less crowded trade, than BTC/ETH,” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph, adding that XRP’s cross-border settlement use case “offers differentiated exposure that continues to attract longer-horizon capital.”  While XRP ETF inflows eased from outsized surges earlier in December, when daily additions reached from $30 million to over $40 million, funds continued to post consistent gains into the final week of the month.

This fuels the argument that wallet distribution alone doesn’t dictate price.\nAs highlighted by Bill Morgan, XRP continues to follow Bitcoin’s lead, with BTC’s market direction remaining the dominant influence.#cryptomarket \nBottom line: Higher prices reshape access, but Bitcoin still drives the trend.\n#XRP #BTC #CryptoMarket","gravity_id":"372418804","id":57595,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T16:20:08.081Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T16:50:09.775Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-30T16:48:19.297Z","text_content":"$XRP  Market Structure Tightens as Retail Gets Priced Out  ▶️ Here's Why Demand Could Matter: https://blocknews.com/xrp-market-structure-tightens-as-retail-gets-priced-out-here-is-why-demand-could-matter/   #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#  #XRP","gravity_id":"372420137","id":57631,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T16:50:07.630Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T17:20:09.190Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-30T16:46:45.159Z","text_content":"In a significant shift for the digital asset landscape, XRP exchange reserves have collapsed to their lowest point since 2018, a move that analysts interpret as a powerful precursor to a major supply shock.\nhttps://bitcoinworld.co.in/xrp-exchange-reserves-eight-year-low/ ","gravity_id":"372420130","id":57632,"createdAt":"2025-12-30T16:50:07.879Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T17:20:09.338Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-30T16:43:07.949Z","text_content":"Lighter ($LIT) finally stepping into the spotlight\nWatching the LIT Listing Carnival on BingX feels like one of those early-cycle moments with solid narrative, real activity, and traders actually showing up.\n\n\nWhat I like?

Standard Chartered has issued one of the most bullish institutional forecasts for XRP, predicting that the token could jump to $8 by the end of 2026, representing a potential 330% upside from its current price of around $1.85.  Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank’s global head of digital asset research, bases the prediction on sustained spot ETF inflows that could potentially reach $10 billion and regulatory clarity following the conclusion of XRP’s legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forecast stands in stark contrast to XRP’s current bearish technical structure, creating a tension between long-term institutional optimism and short-term trading signals.  ETF Momentum Drives Institutional Case The bullish case is based on unprecedented institutional demand via recently launched spot XRP ETFs. According to data from SoSoValue, these products have recorded 30 consecutive trading sessions of net inflows without a single day of outflows, accumulating over $1.15 billion in assets. Total assets under management for XRP ETFs reached $1.24 billion at the end of December.  \"XRP, for now, is mostly a story of ETP and ETF inflows,\" Ryan Lee, principal analyst at Bitget, told Finance Magnates. \"Much depends on the persistence of these inflows and whether institutional interest in Ripple's payment ecosystem will translate into something more significant.\"  The launch of the ETFs coincided with a dramatic supply squeeze, as balances on exchanges fell from over 4 billion tokens in early 2025 to approximately 1.6-1.7 billion by the end of December.   Ray Youssef, CEO of crypto platform NoOnes, predicts that XRP is likely to consolidate between $2 and $2.50 in the first quarter of 2026 unless a decisive catalyst emerges. \"The market has not yet recovered from sustained volatility and geopolitical disruptions,\" Youssef noted.
