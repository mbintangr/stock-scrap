While Bitcoin moves sideways, money is rotating more selectively across the market.

At the same time, ETH funds saw outflows, and SOL inflows stayed modest. Yet $XRP  is still stuck below $2.  🤔 Why no instant price move? ETF buying doesn’t hit exchanges directly. Funds buy XRP via OTC desks and market makers first. The demand is real - it just reaches the market slowly, without flashy pumps.  ⚠️ One more thing to watch: XRP needs a monthly close above ~$2.08 to keep its bullish structure intact.

History suggests assets like BTC often move after metals finish their strongest rallies - not during them.  Looking back, gold peaked in 2011 and again in 2020. In both cases, Bitcoin stayed relatively quiet while metals surged, then rallied hard once gold topped out.  Key Insights: • Past cycles: BTC rallied after gold peaks   • Capital rotation: funds often shift from metals to higher-growth assets   • Scarcity: BTC and $XRP  have capped supply, unlike silver  💡 Takeaway: If metals cool off, history suggests BTC and XRP could be next as capital rotates back into crypto. #BTC Price Analysis#  #XRP   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372440527","id":59113,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T13:10:10.799Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T13:30:09.897Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-31T13:09:42.569Z","text_content":"$XRP  's path from a top-5 token to a real Bitcoin competitor laid out by experts  #XRP  #XRPEFT  #Macro Insights#  #Bitcoin    https://yellow.com/news/what-it-would-take-for-xrp-to-stop-being-a-top-5-token-and-start-competing-with-bitcoin","gravity_id":"372439564","id":59115,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T13:10:12.048Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T13:30:09.373Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-31T13:03:11.274Z","text_content":"🔥 BIG: Spot $XRP ETFs have now logged 30 straight days of net inflows.","gravity_id":"372439540","id":59116,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T13:10:12.339Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T13:30:09.635Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-31T13:00:00.128Z","text_content":"⚖️ Erden Timur faces legal scrutiny  Erden Timur, former vice chairman of Galatasaray, has been arrested in Turkey as part of an ongoing probe.  #ErdenTimur  #Galatasaray  #Crypto  $XRP    https://crypto-economy.com/former-galatasaray-vice-chairman-arrested-in-betting-probe/","gravity_id":"372439525","id":59117,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T13:10:12.891Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T13:20:09.822Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-31T13:13:59.784Z","text_content":"Spot  $XRP ETFs have now logged 30 straight days of net inflows\n#XRP #BingX   $BTC","gravity_id":"372441957","id":59131,"createdAt":"2025-12-31T13:20:07.704Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-31T13:40:09.734Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2025-12-31T13:18:19.043Z","text_content":"🚨 Ripple unlocks 1B  $XRP tomorrow, the first escrow release of 2026.

Price is holding above a clearly marked bullish order block, which has already acted as a demand base and prevented further downside. Market structure on the 4H timeframe is stabilizing, with higher lows forming while price respects the mid-range equilibrium.

Key Highlights Strong 2025 Performance: $XRP   breached $3 in January for the first time in seven years.  New All Time High: The token reached $3.65 in July 2025.  Catalyst: Gains were largely driven by the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit settlement.  Recent Struggles: XRP has declined in recent months amid a broader bear market.  Big Question: Can XRP’s momentum and fundamentals help it surpass Ethereum (ETH) in market cap?  Analysis Ripple’s XRP enjoyed one of its strongest years in 2025, fueled by regulatory clarity and renewed investor confidence. The settlement of the SEC lawsuit removed a major overhang, allowing XRP to surge past $3 and set a new high mid year.  However, the recent downturn highlights the challenges of sustaining growth in a bearish environment.
