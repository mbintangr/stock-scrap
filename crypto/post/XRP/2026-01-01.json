That matters, especially in a slow market.  Why did XRP stand out? Uphold kept XRP listed during regulatory uncertainty, expanded utility via Flare-related yield options, and ran XRP-focused promos. Even as Uphold added dozens of new tokens, XRP stayed liquid.  Legal clarity and the launch of an XRP ETF in November also helped confidence. Quiet year. Tough conditions. Yet XRP kept trading.

In December, the Financial Services Agency officially announced its support for the stablecoin pilot project involving the three banks.  ﻿$XRP  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372467775","id":60694,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T13:20:15.301Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T13:40:09.726Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-01T13:28:45.035Z","text_content":"XRP on exchanges hits 8 year low, but historical data exposes a brutal flaw in the popular “moon” narrative\n\nvia @pelicamatos \n\nhttps://cryptoslate.com/xrp-on-exchanges-hits-8-year-low-but-historical-data-exposes-a-brutal-flaw-in-the-popular-moon-narrative/","gravity_id":"372467853","id":60713,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T13:30:08.918Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T14:10:09.993Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-01T13:26:30.278Z","text_content":"$XRP We need whales for buy JETT 🐳 VG","gravity_id":"372466875","id":60714,"createdAt":"2026-01-01T13:30:09.189Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-01T14:10:10.161Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-01T13:37:45.408Z","text_content":"$XRP   holding well in 2026.
