Analysts say the strike adds a risk premium to oil futures, sparking short‑term volatility. Energy traders expect prices to rise modestly as supply fears ripple through the market.\n\n📈 Stocks: U.S. equities are bracing for turbulence. Energy majors (Exxon, Chevron) and defense contractors (Lockheed Martin, Raytheon) could benefit from heightened demand. Broader indices may open volatile as investors price in geopolitical uncertainty.\n\n🥇 Gold & Silver: Safe‑haven assets are rallying. Gold demand is climbing as investors hedge against instability, while silver is projected to strengthen further, with some analysts eyeing $78/oz if tensions escalate.\n\n💻 Crypto: Digital assets show mixed resilience. @Bitcoin briefly dipped below $90K as traders pulled back from risk exposure, while Ether and XRP held steadier. Analysts note that geopolitical shocks often trigger short‑term sell‑offs, but long‑term crypto adoption trends remain intact.\n\n➡️ Overall, the Venezuela strike is fuelling short‑term turbulence across commodities, equities, and crypto, but experts stress that fundamentals in oil supply, global markets, and blockchain adoption will determine the longer‑term trajectory.\n\n#BreakingNews #Trump #madurocaptured #NicolasMaduro #Venezuela #Markets #Crypto #Oil #Gold #Bitcoin #WorldNews","gravity_id":"372527075","id":64642,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T18:00:09.418Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T18:20:09.860Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-03T17:58:45.088Z","text_content":"XRP Surpasses Binance Coin in Market Value with Strong Recovery https://ift.tt/OZf6RY5","gravity_id":"372527073","id":64643,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T18:00:09.723Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T18:20:10.165Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-03T18:08:42.472Z","text_content":"The new $XRP  whales aren’t here to play.

In less than two months, XRP ETFs have already pulled in over $1B in inflows, locking up around 746M tokens and signaling steady institutional demand.  If that pace continues, ETF assets could reach $5B by mid-2026, potentially removing up to 2.6B XRP - nearly 4% of total supply - from active circulation. At the same time, exchange balances dropped 58% in 2025, a classic sign that holders are moving coins off exchanges to hold, not sell.  Despite lagging below $2 for months, $XRP  has started to stabilize above key support near $1.88. With supply tightening and ETF demand growing, analysts see room for a move toward higher resistance zones - and if institutional inflows stay strong, long-term price targets could shift meaningfully higher into 2026.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #XRP  #Macro Insights#   #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"372530707","id":64958,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T22:20:06.251Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T23:00:09.448Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-03T22:18:01.465Z","text_content":"$XRP all are irrelevant except the clarity act and actual adoptions.","gravity_id":"372530725","id":64963,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T22:20:07.816Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T23:10:10.277Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-03T22:24:47.299Z","text_content":"$XRP\n38 Trillions (US Debt) stacked as $1 bills stacked on top of each other, how high would the stack be?\nLet’s do it step-by-step.\nThickness of a US $1 bill\n≈ 0.11 mm (0.0043 inches)\nCalculation\n1 trillion bills stacked ≈ 110,000 km\n38 trillion bills stacked:\n110,000 km × 38 = 4,180,000 km\nFinal answer\n38 trillion one-dollar bills stacked would be about\n👉 4.18 million kilometres high\nTo visualise that:\n🌕 Moon distance: ~384,400 km → this stack goes ~11× past the Moon\n☀️ Distance to the Sun: ~150 million km → about 2.8% of the way to the Sun\n🛰️ Earth’s diameter: ~12,742 km → stacked height equals ~328 Earths\nThat’s an absolutely astronomical pile of paper money.","gravity_id":"372530757","id":64975,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T22:30:08.369Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T23:30:10.762Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-03T22:35:51.003Z","text_content":"$BTC   briefly fell below $90,000 on Saturday before climbing back up above the $90,000 level, where it is trading at the time of this writing.  “The US bombed a country and captured its leader, on a weekend no less, and yet Bitcoin has barely moved,” Nic Puckrin, market analyst and founder of the crypto media company Coin Bureau, said in an X post.   ﻿$XRP  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372529990","id":64983,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T22:40:06.307Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T23:30:10.467Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-03T22:39:08.619Z","text_content":"$XRP Dont Trust Fear Greed & Altcoin 🖖🏻 War Need Money 🔥 Trap…Sell Now…News TT Musk BB…Crypto time trap","gravity_id":"372533006","id":64989,"createdAt":"2026-01-03T22:40:08.551Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-03T22:40:08.551Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-03T22:40:15.300Z","text_content":"Rep.

The most important structure on this chart is the breaker block highlighted in blue. This is the zone that powered the breakout and now acts as key support. If price returns to it and forms bullish reaction, it confirms that buyers are still in control.\n\n\nThe major target remains the upper resistance area near $2.18, where previous rallies stalled and significant liquidity is resting. Markets rarely move in straight lines, so pullbacks into strength are normal rather than signs of weakness.\n\n\nA deeper rejection only becomes concerning if price loses the breaker block and closes below it, because that would signal absorption of buying pressure.

In reality, liquidity does. And right now, liquidity is behaving in a way that usually precedes sharp, uneven moves.  You can see it clearly: Bitcoin trades in a range, Ethereum hesitates, but mid-cap tokens experience sudden bursts of volume followed by fast cooldowns. That pattern usually means one thing - capital is moving fast, but committing slowly.  In these conditions, traders care less about “where to invest” and more about “where to move quickly.” That’s why faster ecosystems quietly gain relevance. TON often becomes a temporary base where traders rebalance positions, manage risk, and wait for confirmation.  STONfi fits naturally into this flow. When speed matters more than narrative, execution becomes the priority.

The analysis points to a cup and handle formation, with XRP’s price following a predictable Elliott Wave structure.\n\nKey Insights:\nWave 2 has recently completed, with the handle phase aligning with a correction. The breakout from this phase signals the beginning of Wave 3, which typically shows the strongest impulse in the Elliott Wave model.\n\nWave 3 projections place XRP at $5.59 (161.80% extension), with further targets at $7.17 and $13.45.\n\nBeyond Wave 3, Wave 5 targets suggest prices could reach between $19 and $28, with $27 being the upper end of the projection.\n\nDespite these bullish projections, the analyst cautions that a drop below $1.60 would invalidate the model, emphasizing that price action, not mere optimism, will define XRP’s next move.\n\n#DYOR #BingX  $BTC","gravity_id":"372549445","id":65965,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T15:30:06.541Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T16:20:22.170Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-04T15:23:08.722Z","text_content":"$XRP\n\nYou’re still on time. $XRP\n\n✨️ TRADE NOW: https://lbank.com/ref/5HCYP","gravity_id":"372544665","id":65974,"createdAt":"2026-01-04T15:30:09.885Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-04T16:20:22.476Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-04T15:22:32.514Z","text_content":"$XRP   did exactly what we said yesterday.
