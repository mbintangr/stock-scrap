His forecast has quickly become a talking point across the crypto community.   Current Market Snapshot   At present, XRP trades around $1.87, marking a 1.44% gain in the past 24 hours. However, the token has still fallen 14.99% year to date, while silver surged an impressive 167.70% throughout 2025.   Sentiment Remains Bearish   Market data from Santiment shows that sentiment around XRP continues to lean negative. Bearish mentions are currently 20% to 30% higher than levels observed back in November, underscoring skepticism among traders despite Kim’s ambitious forecast.   Market Implications   While the claim of #XRP   surpassing gold and silver in 2026 is eye catching, current trading trends and sentiment suggest that investor confidence remains fragile.

What matters more than the spike is where price is holding now — above $2.10 and the 100-hour MA, with a clear bullish trendline support near $2.07.  📈 Bull case: A clean break above $2.165 opens the door to $2.18 → $2.20. If bulls stay in control, extensions toward $2.25–$2.32 aren’t off the table. Momentum here looks constructive, not euphoric.  📉 Risk to watch: Failure to reclaim $2.165 could trigger a pullback toward $2.12 and $2.07. A loss of $2.07 would shift short-term structure back to neutral, with $2.02–$2.00 as the key demand zone.  Bottom line: XRP is in a decision zone. Holding above $2.10 favors continuation; losing $2.07 changes the narrative.

Pools like STON/USDT remove lock-ups entirely, appealing to users who value flexibility and steady participation. Others, such as AMORE/TON, introduce longer lock periods, signaling a preference for committed liquidity rather than fast rotations.  When multiple lock models coexist, it usually means the protocol is designing for diverse user behavior - not just one dominant strategy.  #TON  #Macro Insights#  #DeFi Strategy#  #Pools  #Bullish  $XRP","gravity_id":"372580615","id":67955,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T15:00:09.958Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T15:10:10.972Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-05T15:08:44.822Z","text_content":"🔥 Polls with narrative tokens often capture attention - but execution still matters.

After months of steady selling, $XRP   finally found its footing, just as the rest of the crypto market started to bounce back. Bitcoin’s climbing toward $90K again, Ethereum’s holding above $3K, and people are willing to take on risk. You can see that reflected in XRP now.  Sellers had their run, XRP managed to bounce from a key demand zone and pull itself back above some important support. The relentless selling we saw during the last cycle is losing steam. Now, the big question is whether this turnaround can actually stick, especially with the broader market and structural changes working in its favor.  What really jumps out, how institutional players are acting. Spot ETFs for XRP just had $43.16 million in net inflows last week. That’s a real sign that regulated funds want a piece. XRPZ led with $21.76 million, and Bitwise’s XRP fund added $17.27 million, bumping its total up to $252 million. These aren’t quick trades—they’re long-term bets.  Outflows? Pretty minimal. XRPC saw a small $1.18 million outflow, but that’s nothing compared to what’s come in before. It looks more like investors shifting between products than pulling out of XRP altogether. Right now, ETF assets total $1.37 billion, which is about 1.14% of XRP’s market cap. Cumulative inflows are at $1.18 billion. Basically, institutions are getting more involved and spreading out their bets.  XRP broke out of a months-long falling wedge. Price is hanging near $2.13, above a demand zone where sellers kept failing. As that wedge pattern played out, buyers started to take control, and you can see the momentum building. The RSI is up in the mid-60s, just strong.  If buyers can keep XRP above $2.22, the breakout pattern stays alive and the target is clear: $3.53, which is about a 65% jump from here. If things slip below $2.05, though, that setup falls apart and opens the door down to $1.80.","gravity_id":"372582688","id":68160,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T16:30:09.533Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T17:00:11.629Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-05T16:25:45.073Z","text_content":"POV: you understand the lore behind XRP memes ","gravity_id":"372582661","id":68161,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T16:30:09.852Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T16:50:11.619Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-05T16:23:03.220Z","text_content":"$XRP Overtakes $BNB in ETF Demand\nRipple (XRP) has now surpassed BNB in ETF demand — a notable shift in market dynamics and investor interest.\n#BNB     #XRP","gravity_id":"372584429","id":68162,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T16:30:10.185Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T16:50:11.949Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-05T16:22:00.770Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $XRP","gravity_id":"372584410","id":68163,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T16:30:10.524Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T16:40:10.280Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-05T16:38:52.063Z","text_content":"New year, back at it again   I’m trading XRP$XRP  and SOL in Bitget Trading Club Championship (Phase 24).
