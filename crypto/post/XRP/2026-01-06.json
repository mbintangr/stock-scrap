After a prolonged corrective phase, price has successfully defended the major demand zone around $1.85–$2.00, which has acted as a strong base in the past. The recent bullish reaction from this zone signals that sellers are losing control, while buyers are gradually stepping in with confidence. This move marks the early phase of a trend reversal, where higher lows are starting to form and downside momentum is fading.\n\n\nFrom a long trade perspective, the current structure supports a continuation toward the upside as long as price holds above the key support region. The breakout from the descending channel on the weekly timeframe adds further confirmation that momentum is building step by step. If $XRP maintains acceptance above $2.00–$2.10, the path remains open toward the previous supply zone near $3.50, which aligns with a major resistance and a logical upside target. Patience is key here, as weekly moves develop gradually, but the risk-to-reward still favors the bulls.\n\n\nShort Outlook:\nAs long as price stays above the $1.85 support, bearish setups remain weak, and any pullbacks are more likely to be corrective rather than trend-changing. A sustained break below this level would be needed to invalidate the bullish outlook.","gravity_id":"372592621","id":68880,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T22:20:09.160Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T22:40:11.140Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-05T22:15:54.489Z","text_content":"$XRP time to short in a few days","gravity_id":"372593360","id":68881,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T22:20:09.483Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T22:40:11.462Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-05T22:27:41.401Z","text_content":"$XRP come April repeat drop just like 2x before?🤭 pity they never learn with bloated retail group P&D trash like Javon Marks (GGFs)","gravity_id":"372592688","id":68898,"createdAt":"2026-01-05T22:30:08.810Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-05T22:50:11.159Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-05T22:26:28.070Z","text_content":"$XRP   is at a key decision point,either a breakout or a retracement.

The move represents the #strongest  performance since mid-November and outpaced gains across other major digital assets.   $BTC  rose to its highest level since mid-November, gaining more than 3% to $94,400 during Monday's trading session. The rally brought the asset closer to $95,000, a level analysts view as necessary to #gain  further momentum. The percentage advance was the largest in more than a month.   Crypto-related stocks posted sharp gains after experiencing sustained selling pressure in late 2025. Coinbase (COIN) received an upgrade to a Buy rating from Goldman Sachs earlier Monday and rose nearly 9%. Strategy (MSTR) and Robinhood (HOOD) gained 5% and 6%, respectively.   Smaller-cap stocks posted double-digit gains. Bakkt (BKKT) jumped 30% higher, while Figure (FIGR) added 20%. Bitcoin miner Hut 8 (HUT) climbed 15% Monday, nearly reaching $60 per share. The stock's split-adjusted 2021 record high of $76 may be within reach for longtime investors.   U.S. stocks also rose Monday, with the Dow advancing 1.4%. The #Nasdaq  and S&P 500 posted more modest gains of 0.7%. Precious metals remained volatile with an upward trend, as #silver  advanced 7% and gold 3%.   Lukman Otunuga, senior market analyst at FXTM, stated that $BTC  may be positioned for a comeback in 2026 after falling more than 6% in 2025. Falling interest rates and a thinning supply of actively traded $BTC  could create conditions for recovery, with long-term holders who are keeping coins off exchanges potentially tightening supply and supporting prices.","gravity_id":"372593912","id":69039,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T00:00:10.390Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T00:20:11.913Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-06T00:00:36.857Z","text_content":"I'm bullish on $XRP","gravity_id":"372596455","id":69050,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T00:10:08.686Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T00:30:11.864Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-06T00:15:27.772Z","text_content":"$XRP\nAi predicts XRP supply shock by 11 Jan 2026.

Quick Take Ripple’s $XRP   had a breakout year in 2025.  SEC lawsuit settlement boosted investor confidence.  XRP hit a new all time high of $3.65 in July 2025.  Several spot ETFs launched, marking a milestone for institutional adoption.  The big question: Can ETFs drive XRP to $10 in 2026?   2025 Highlights Legal clarity: Ripple settled its long running lawsuit with the US SEC, removing a major overhang.  Price surge: XRP reached $3.65, its highest level in more than seven years.  ETF debut: Multiple spot ETFs launched, opening new doors for institutional investors.   2026 Outlook ETF momentum: Continued inflows could sustain demand and push prices higher.  Institutional adoption: Regulatory clarity may attract more traditional finance players.  Price target: Analysts are debating whether XRP can realistically hit $10 within the year.   Risks to Watch Market volatility: Crypto cycles remain unpredictable.  Regulatory shifts: Global policy changes could impact ETF growth.  Competition: Other payment focused and Layer 1 tokens may challenge XRP’s dominance.  #XRP  ’s transformation in 2025  from legal battles to ETF launches has set the stage for a potentially explosive 2026.

What's next? If we look closely, spot CVD and futures CVD are at their lows—there's no significant buying at market prices, yet the price has \"taken off.\" At the same time, Open Interest (OI) is rising, which seems counterintuitive.  There are three reasons why OI could be rising: 1.  New longs are being opened with limit orders (which we are observing), and the price is rising by absorbing seller liquidity. 2.  Large futures positions are being opened in anticipation of upcoming events (and the beginning of the year is very interesting). 3.  A Short Trap (I love the word \"manipulation\").  Spot CVD can remain flat even as OI rises. But if we zoom in from the 1D to the 1H timeframe, we can see futures CVD starting to rise—leveraged positions are being opened. This leads to the conclusion that a reversal is likely soon (honestly, it's a bit foolish to jump into a market that has already moved without you).  What to expect from this move? The volume is negligible, so momentum will likely weaken, leading to consolidation above the broken zone. After that, we'll have to assess based on context, because the second scenario is manipulation, and what we see on the chart now could just be a price level deviation.  In any case, buying now isn't advisable. It's better to set limit orders: EP1: $2.2 EP2: $1.96 EP3: Below the green highlighted zones.  Potential take-profit levels could range from $2.55 to $3.

Gold tends to move first in periods where the market starts repricing trust and settlement. It absorbs uncertainty quietly, then expands once liquidity expectations stabilize. Seeing $XRP  trace a similar structural pattern with a delay suggests this is less about momentum trading and more about a shift in how some participants are thinking about payment rails and balance sheet exposure.  The ETF volume matters here because it changes behavior. When inflows are driven by products that cannot instantly exit, price discovery slows down and volatility compresses upward. That is very different from speculative leverage chasing a breakout. It creates conditions where pullbacks are absorbed rather than cascaded.  A move toward $3 becomes plausible if flows persist, because the marginal seller disappears when capital starts treating an asset as infrastructure rather than a trade.  If that sounds abstract, it should. These transitions rarely announce themselves loudly. They usually look confusing, uneven, and slightly uncomfortable at first. That is often when the most durable repricings begin.","gravity_id":"372610941","id":69908,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T12:40:09.173Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T12:40:09.173Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-06T12:39:03.239Z","text_content":"XRP Rich List in Focus as Price Holds Above $2\n\n\nAs $XRP trades above $2, attention is shifting toward supply distribution.

RLUSD Crosses the $1B Milestone  Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is gaining serious traction. Launched on December 17, 2024, it has already surpassed a $1 billion market cap in under a year. That kind of growth signals strong adoption and rising confidence in Ripple’s ecosystem.  For XRP holders, RLUSD’s expansion strengthens the network’s fundamentals and provides a more solid base for potential price appreciation.  2. Institutional Interest Is Accelerating  Institutional adoption is no longer theoretical. Abu Dhabi has opened its financial zone to licensed firms using RLUSD — a major step toward real-world integration.  More importantly, RLUSD can now be used as collateral for lending and borrowing, positioning it as a functional financial instrument. This increases the relevance of Ripple’s infrastructure and could indirectly boost demand for XRP as the network’s native liquidity asset.  3. XRP Shows Technical Resilience  Despite a difficult market over the past two months, XRP has held above its key support level. Although price briefly dipped below support twice since October 10, both moves were quickly reclaimed — a clear sign of buyer strength.  This type of structure often precedes expansion once broader market conditions improve.  The Bigger Picture  For years, XRP’s potential was clear, but its fundamentals lacked visible catalysts. The growth of RLUSD, combined with institutional traction and strong technical support, is beginning to change that narrative.  If Bitcoin regains its all-time high and momentum returns to the market, XRP could be well-positioned for a strong rally.  Bottom line: Fundamentals + adoption + structure are aligning. XRP is no longer just hype — it’s becoming a setup worth watching closely.","gravity_id":"372613413","id":70031,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T13:50:10.500Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T13:50:10.500Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-06T13:59:57.593Z","text_content":"$XRP  surged to nearly $2.40 on January 6, 2026, jumping 11% in just 24 hours. This rally is fueled by heavy institutional volumes and a tightening supply of tokens on exchanges. XRP broke through a key resistance band that had capped its gains for weeks, with traders now targeting higher levels like $2.70 and potentially $10.  The token’s momentum is further supported by record ETF inflows, with $46 million flooding into XRP on the same day, bringing total trading volume to $7. 8 billion. XRP’s breakout follows a multi-month corrective phase, drawing comparisons to gold’s price movement after a similar structure.  With the market sentiment growing more bullish, XRP’s technicals align for further growth, especially if $BTC  holds above $94,000. This rally shows promise for XRP’s future, making it an exciting time for traders.   #Crypto  #BingX  #Blockchain","gravity_id":"372615258","id":70042,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T14:02:27.188Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T14:20:10.326Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-06T14:00:11.238Z","text_content":"XRP Rich List in Focus as Price Holds Above $2\n\n\nAs $XRP trades above $2, attention is shifting toward supply distribution.

That’s strong demand showing up, not just traders chasing momentum. From a market structure perspective, XRP $XRP  has broken above a key range and is now trying to turn old resistance into support. Volume confirms the move, which is what separates real breakouts from short-lived spikes. What comes next? Two realistic paths: ➡️ Continuation toward $3  If XRP holds above the $2.20–$2.30 zone and buyers keep defending dips, the next liquidity area sits around $2.80–$3.00. A firm push through $2.50 could accelerate that move quickly. ➡️ Pullback before higher Some cooling off wouldn’t be surprising after a sharp run.

XRP’s breakout above the $2 level came with strong volume and record ETF activity, which shows growing institutional interest. This is a positive sign and confirms that demand is improving after a long consolidation phase.  Bull case: If $XRP   can hold above $2, this level should now act as strong support. With continued ETF inflows and a healthy crypto market, price could slowly push toward $2.50 and eventually test the $3 psychological level. The structure has clearly improved compared to previous months.  Risk / pullback scenario: Even with strong news, $XRP   is still near a major resistance zone. If volume weakens or the broader market turns risk-off, profit-taking could easily send price back to $2 or slightly below before the next real move higher.  My view: The trend is constructive but not overheated. As long as $2 holds, the bias stays bullish and another push higher is likely. A clean break below $2 would mean this breakout needs more time to build strength.  Summary: ➡️ Hold above $2 = higher chance to move toward $3 ⬇️ Lose $2 = likely pullback and consolidation first","gravity_id":"372621028","id":70494,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T18:00:08.043Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T18:00:08.043Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-06T17:58:29.054Z","text_content":"$XRP  the manipulation is strong in this one!","gravity_id":"372619787","id":70495,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T18:00:08.382Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T18:00:08.382Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-06T17:58:18.753Z","text_content":"$XRPas usual a pump and dump","gravity_id":"372621019","id":70496,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T18:00:08.728Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T18:00:08.728Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-06T17:58:15.816Z","text_content":"$XRP When XRP was growing nonstop for a whole week and decided to give a little pullback:😭😭😭😭😭mussoor","gravity_id":"372621018","id":70497,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T18:00:09.063Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T18:00:09.063Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-06T17:56:44.330Z","text_content":"$XRP and down to next target 1.20 🫵😱🙀🤔🤡🫵💯","gravity_id":"372619771","id":70498,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T18:00:09.440Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T18:00:09.440Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-06T17:56:07.022Z","text_content":"$XRP Remember… there are NO rules and regulations… i hope you all got your 30% and got the F out","gravity_id":"372619768","id":70499,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T18:00:09.872Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T18:00:09.872Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-06T17:54:06.652Z","text_content":"Have you tried using GetAgent for your trades yet?

If you look at the 1h candles, the rejection was pretty sharp. We’ve just sliced through the immediate support and now we're hovering around 2.28.\nThe volume on this last red drop is what has me cautious. It looks like some of the local longs are being flushed out.\nI’m looking at the 2.13 - 2.16 zone next. If we can’t hold this current level, we probably slide back there to test the previous breakout point. I'm not shorting this yet because the 7-day trend is still up 23%, but I'm definitely not chasing here either.\nWatching the order book closely. Sellers are definitely leaning on it right now.\n\n#XRP","gravity_id":"372619755","id":70502,"createdAt":"2026-01-06T18:00:10.879Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T18:00:10.879Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-06T17:52:57.232Z","text_content":"$XRP  just broke out on record ETF volume and the move looks serious.  This wasn’t a low-liquidity pump. Strong volume suggests real demand, not hype. If XRP holds above the breakout zone, a push toward $3 is on the table.  That said, sharp moves often cool off. A pullback toward $2 would be healthy and could set up a stronger continuation if buyers step in.  Key level to watch: hold above resistance or lose it.  Volatility is back.
