Steph is Crypto, a well-known market analyst, has identified what he believes is a “powerful” RSI Signal on the XRP weekly chart, anticipating an upward push.\r \r Steph revealed this in his latest commentary on XRP’s price action, as the altcoin records a sustained corrective wave following the rebound effort earlier in the year.   Specifically, after soaring 29% from $1.87 at the start of the year to $2.41 by Jan. 6, XRP faced resistance alongside the rest of the crypto market, now down 12% from that peak.  However, while the current price situation warrants caution, Steph believes XRP has the potential to push further upward, considering signals from the RSI momentum indicator. Notably, Steph confirmed that the weekly RSI has repeated a pattern that has led to impressive price upswings on three occasions since 2024.  \r \r \r For context, the RSI indicator features two lines: the primary RSI line in yellow and the RSI-based moving average (MA) in white. Specifically, data from the accompanying chart confirms that each time the RSI line moves above the MA on the weekly timeframe, what typically follows is a massive price spike.  \r \r The first time this happened in 2024 was in early July, and the XRP price responded by soaring from $0.47 to a high of $0.66 by the end of July, representing a 40% rise within four weeks. Interestingly, the pattern played out again in early November 2024, leading to XRP’s explosive 480% rise from $0.5 to $2.9 by December 2024. This coincided with the Trump-led rally at the time.  \r \r After months of choppy price movements, this pattern re-emerged in late June 2025. What followed was an XRP price surge from $2.018 to the current all-time high of $3.65 in July. This marked an 80% uptick within a month.","gravity_id":"372696373","id":75509,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T06:10:10.774Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T07:20:13.796Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-09T06:00:42.263Z","text_content":"Do you believe  $XRP could hit $5,000 one day?\n#XRP #XRPETF","gravity_id":"372696372","id":75510,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T06:10:11.035Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T07:00:11.773Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-09T06:20:04.719Z","text_content":"$XRP   Price Potential if Market Cap Matches Major Assets  🔹 Despite a challenging 2025, where XRP dropped from $3.65 to $1.84, analysts are eyeing its long-term upside if its market cap aligns with major global assets.  🔹 Price Projections Based on Market Cap:  🔹If XRP matched Bitcoin ($1.79T): ~$29.50 per token (circulating supply: 60.67B)  🔹If XRP matched silver ($4.07T): ~$67 per token (+3,184% from current $2.04)  🔹If XRP matched Apple ($4.02T): ~$66.27 per token  ⚠️ These projections are theoretical and assume full market cap alignment.

A rare two-way liquidation chain on the Binance futures side cleared leveraged positions on both the upside and downside. As a result, the spot price was stuck in the $2.07 to $2.17 range. The search for direction prevailed until a new catalyst arrived. Two-Way Liquidation Locks XRP in a Narrow Band  In the last 24 hours, XRP has fallen 2.3%, dropping from $2.17 to $2.12. On January 5th, when the price approached $2.40, approximately 4.4 million dollars worth of short positions were liquidated. The next day, the direction reversed, with a total of $5.5 million worth of long positions liquidated. A wait-and-see approach of approximately 1 million dollars also emerged on the Binance side.  The symmetrical liquidation sequence indicated indecision rather than a clear trend. Excessive leverage was removed, and tail risk decreased. However, the market punished both sides. The trading flow became technical. The short-term narrative was determined by leverage resets, not fundamental dynamics. The 2.07 Support and 2.17 Resistance levels became clearly defined on the chart.  The clearest signal came from the demand pocket between $2.07 and $2.08. At 2 PM on January 8th, volume jumped to 154.85 million XRP. This figure was 93% above the 24-hour average of 66.4 million. When the price dropped to the lower band, buyers absorbed the selling pressure, and a V-shaped reaction occurred.  This reaction carried XRP from $2.09 to $2.16 between 3 PM and 5 PM, but the rise stalled again near $2.17.

On Friday, $XRP   remained above this key support, trading around 2.13, suggesting buying interest is gradually returning.  If the 50-day EMA at 2.07 continues to hold, $XRP   could extend its recovery toward the next daily resistance around 2.35. Momentum indicators support this scenario, with both RSI and MACD showing early signs of stabilization, similar to BTC and ETH.
