This move aligns with a familiar pattern that emerged in early 2026, in which leverage, rather than long-term adoption news, drives short-term XRP price swings.  Ripple Labs’ native token started 2026 strongly, climbing approximately +35% from December 31 to $2.40 by January 6, but a broader market pullback has seen XRP struggle to maintain that momentum in the first few days of the new year.  ﻿#XRP","gravity_id":"372717040","id":77067,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T21:10:11.717Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T21:40:12.633Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-09T21:19:45.112Z","text_content":"When the Senate can't decide on crypto, just remember: $XRP, $BTC, and $ETH are still doing the cha-cha while we wait! 💃🕺  \n\nWhat a dance-off! 😂  \n\n#CryptoChaos #HODL #XRP #CryptoMeme  \n\nhttps://coinlive.me/p/ripple-seeks-clarity-senate-bill-uncertain.webm","gravity_id":"372715565","id":77080,"createdAt":"2026-01-09T21:20:10.290Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T21:50:13.138Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-09T21:17:12.544Z","text_content":"$XRP\n\n\n🚨 Institutions don’t enter crypto to speculate — they enter to build infrastructure.\n\n\nBNY launches tokenized deposits → on-chain cash for institutions.\nThis isn’t hype.

We've already got another XRP ETF int he pipeline and for 2026 analyst are already predicting over 100 crypto ETF's and the inflow is definitely helping push prices.\n\n🔥 Supply Shortage: Next thing on our list is supply shortage. In our last idea we spoke on the fact that 500 million of XRP was locked up until 2028 which took more supply away from the market. Alongside that Flare Network will be locking up 5 billion XRP by mid-2026 and ETF's have removed over 500 million XRP from the market already. As it stands current supply on exchanges is at 1.6 billion tokens representing a 7 year low.

This isn’t about Ripple becoming an e-commerce giant or Amazon suddenly accepting $XRP  as a payment method. The comparison is more strategic than literal, pointing to how Ripple has been steadily expanding its financial infrastructure through acquisitions and partnerships across payments, custody, liquidity, and settlement. In this setup, XRP plays the role of a settlement layer, not a consumer-facing product.  What makes this interesting is the long-term positioning. Ripple being listed on AWS or using cloud and AI tools doesn’t equal an Amazon–XRP partnership, but it does show a focus on institutional-grade systems. Strip away the hype, and the story becomes less about bold headlines and more about Ripple building the plumbing for global finance, with $XRP  embedded at the core rather than front and center. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"372718792","id":77267,"createdAt":"2026-01-10T00:10:10.051Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-10T01:30:11.283Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-10T00:15:52.124Z","text_content":"CNBC: XRP Is the Hottest Crypto Trade of 2026\n\n\nCNBC has labeled $XRP the “hottest crypto trade of the year,” citing its early 2026 outperformance and consistent ETF inflows.

According to recent analysis, XRP’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved back above its moving average, a signal that historically has coincided with periods of trend continuation or renewed bullish momentum. Higher-timeframe RSI shifts are often viewed as more reliable than short-term signals, as they reduce market noise and reflect broader sentiment changes.

After the strong rally, price went into a long correction phase where weak hands were slowly shaken out. That phase looks close to completion.\n\nRight now, XRP is holding above a key support zone where buyers have stepped in before. The selling pressure has clearly slowed down, and price is no longer making aggressive lower lows. This usually happens when a market is preparing for a direction change.\n\nWhat matters most here is stability. As long as XRP holds this base and continues to build above support, the downside remains limited and the recovery structure stays valid.\n\n\nIf momentum starts to pick up, the first upside move can target the $2.50–$2.70 area, which is a major reaction zone. A clean break above that opens the door toward $3.30–$3.60, and if the broader market stays supportive, XRP can aim for $4+ in the next expansion phase.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"372736213","id":78439,"createdAt":"2026-01-10T17:40:10.455Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-10T17:50:12.112Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-10T17:49:04.882Z","text_content":"$XRP I amfinally admit that I am bearish.\nEver hear of price growth?","gravity_id":"372736270","id":78452,"createdAt":"2026-01-10T17:50:10.959Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-10T17:50:10.959Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-10T17:44:42.593Z","text_content":"$XRP Y'all know nothing.","gravity_id":"372736251","id":78453,"createdAt":"2026-01-10T17:50:11.344Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-10T17:50:11.344Z"}]
