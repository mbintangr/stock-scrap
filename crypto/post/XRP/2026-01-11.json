Institutional demand for XRP-linked products, including roughly $1.3B in spot ETF inflows, highlights strong off-chain adoption and confidence in Ripple’s broader business strategy, even as the company expands its footprint in regulated financial markets.\n\nMeanwhile, activity on the  $XRP Ledger (XRPL) tells a different story. DeFi usage and total value locked remain relatively low, suggesting that capital inflows tied to XRP are not translating into meaningful on-chain engagement. This gap underscores how institutional exposure to crypto assets does not always drive immediate ecosystem growth.\n\nLooking ahead, Ripple’s challenge will be aligning its financial-market success with renewed XRPL utility. If innovation and incentives revive developer and user participation, on-chain metrics could catch up.
