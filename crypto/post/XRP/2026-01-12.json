The primary driver is a three-month high in whale activity; on January 6, the network recorded 2,802 transactions valued at $100,000 or more. While massive transfers (like Ripple’s internal 300M XRP shift) are often operational, the sheer volume of large-scale movement has introduced structural volatility, leading to a \"leverage flush\" that wiped out approximately $22 million in long positions in a single day.\n\n​Technically, $XRP is struggling with the $2.10–$2.12 resistance zone. It is currently trading below its 100-hour Simple Moving Average, signaling a short-term bearish bias. However, the downside is being cushioned by record-breaking ETF net assets, which hit $1.37 billion this month, suggesting that institutional \"buy-and-hold\" demand is absorbing the retail and whale-driven sell pressure.\n\n​The next critical watch is the $1.98–$2.03 support floor. A sustained hold here keeps the bullish $3.00+ mid-term thesis alive, while a failure to reclaim $2.12 could see a deeper correction toward the $1.80 value zone as whales continue to reposition.\n#XRP #MarketAnalysis #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372769452","id":80808,"createdAt":"2026-01-12T07:00:11.098Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T07:50:13.759Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-12T07:02:00.065Z","text_content":"$XRP  Post-Pump Cooldown Zone \n\nXRP has cooled off after a strong impulsive move and is now building a base.\nHolding this range keeps the bullish structure valid for the next leg up.\n\nEntry Zone: 2.05 – 2.09\nBullish Above: 2.03\n\nTargets:\nTP1: 2.15\nTP2: 2.25\nTP3: 2.40\n\nSL: 1.98","gravity_id":"372770496","id":80818,"createdAt":"2026-01-12T07:10:10.572Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T08:00:14.084Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-12T07:13:18.142Z","text_content":"￼ $XRP is on its on level.
