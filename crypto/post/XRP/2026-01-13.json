Resistance near $2.27 remains a major hurdle, keeping upside moves corrective for now.\n\nOn lower timeframes, price compression and declining volume hint at a volatility expansion ahead. A move above $2.15–$2.27 could spark a short-term relief rally, while a break below $2.08 risks a retest of $2.00\n#Macro Insights# #Ripple","gravity_id":"372798013","id":82796,"createdAt":"2026-01-13T04:30:12.048Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-13T05:40:14.619Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-13T04:47:49.702Z","text_content":"$XRP just lost its’ no 4 spot on CMC to BNB.

Alternatives: loss of $2.00 on expanding sell volume risks a move toward $1.95–$1.82. A volume-backed break above $2.22 would improve structure and allow a rotation toward $2.28 resistance.
