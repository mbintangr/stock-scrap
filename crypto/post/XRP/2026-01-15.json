This kind of structure often precedes expansion, but only if the breakout holds.

That behavior signals acceptance, not just a wick.  If price slips back inside the triangle, the move likely needs more time and the breakout thesis gets delayed or invalidated.  👉 Do you see this as the start of a real trend change for XRP, or another range trap?  #XRP  #Ripple  #XRPPriceAnalysis  #AltcoinSeason","gravity_id":"372853125","id":86358,"createdAt":"2026-01-14T18:10:08.316Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T18:40:10.315Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-14T18:02:11.375Z","text_content":"$ADA  Trading Around Its Major Support In Weekly TF, It Successfully Bounced From The Major Support. $ADA  Is A Direct Competitior Of $XRP  For Cross Border Payments Using Crypto.
