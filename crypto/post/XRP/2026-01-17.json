Looking at the 1-Week and 1-Day charts, here is a simple breakdown of what is happening:  📊 The Technical View Key Support: On the Daily chart, $XRP  is sitting right on the MA(30) (blue line) around $2.05. This is a major \"must-hold\" level for the bulls.  Weekly Strength: The Weekly chart shows we are still in a long-term uptrend. We are currently testing the previous resistance as new support.  Momentum: The RSI is at 49 (Neutral). This means the market is taking a breath before the next big move.  💡 Why this matters now (Jan 2026) The charts are matching the news. With XRP ETF inflows crossing $1.3 billion and Ripple’s new partnership with LMAX for the RLUSD stablecoin, the floor for $XRP   is getting stronger.  🎯 My Outlook Bullish: If we hold above $2.00 this week, the next target is the recent high of $2.41.  Bearish: If we drop below $1.95, we might see a quick dip to $1.77 to find more buyers.  What do you think? Will the $2.00 support hold, or are we going lower before the next pump?

Buyers are starting to step in as RSI stabilizes, hinting at fading downside momentum. A breakout above the channel and reclaim of the 100 MA (~$2.10) would shift momentum bullish, opening targets around $2.15 and $2.19. Until then, this remains a structure-based bounce play. ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372950157","id":91174,"createdAt":"2026-01-17T14:10:08.926Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-17T15:10:10.982Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-17T14:02:51.473Z","text_content":"$XRP about to pump \n\n\nPerfect time to invest in","gravity_id":"372950155","id":91175,"createdAt":"2026-01-17T14:10:09.215Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-17T15:00:09.938Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-17T14:01:05.817Z","text_content":"$XRP   Clear MSS to the downside, price tapped into the OB, got the reaction, and now consolidating below key levels  As long as $XRP  stays under 2.15–2.20, upside looks capped","gravity_id":"372949313","id":91176,"createdAt":"2026-01-17T14:10:09.507Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-17T14:40:11.755Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-17T14:13:45.094Z","text_content":"South Korea’s retail traders have made $XRP their top trading vehicle, outpacing Bitcoin and Ethereum on local exchanges due to speed, liquidity, and volatility.

Its key value lies in its use in real financial flows and integration with banks and payment providers. That is why XRP often reacts not only to the market but also to regulatory and infrastructure news.  Currently, XRP is trading around $2.06. Over the past 24 hours, the dynamics have been neutral, over the past 7 days — sideways after a surge at the beginning of the month, and over the past 30 days, the price is still firmly in positive territory. The 4H chart shows that after peaking in the $2.40–2.45 zone, the asset went into correction and is now forming a base. Key support is $2.00–2.02, below that is $1.90. Resistance is $2.15 and $2.30. Volumes have declined, which is typical for the accumulation phase. With the return of volumes and a breakout of $2.15, I estimate the probability of a move to $2.30–2.40 at approximately 60–65% in the medium term. XRP remains an indicator of institutional interest, which means it is an important marker for the entire market, including the DeFi segment.  Against the backdrop of such volatility, it is particularly interesting to see how traders and investors use the DEX infrastructure, and STONfi in the TON ecosystem is a good example here. STONfi is not just an exchange, but an AMM-DEX with a well-thought-out architecture: fast TON block finality, low fees, and transparent smart contract logic without custodial risks.  Technically, STONfi implements liquidity pools with fair fee distribution and on-chain position accounting. Adding liquidity is not a “black box” but a transparent mechanism: you can see your share of the pool, fees, and APR dynamics. For a market where assets such as $XRP  can remain in a range for weeks, such DeFi tools become a way to work with volatility rather than just wait.

Buy now? Wait for a dip? Chase momentum?  This is where dollar-cost averaging (DCA) quietly makes the most sense.  Instead of trying to time the market, DCA lets you buy Bitcoin on a fixed schedule daily, weekly, or monthly  regardless of price.   It’s boring, simple, and effective. And honestly, that’s why it works.  Among exchanges that support recurring Bitcoin purchases, Bitget stands out for how practical the setup feels.   You can automate BTC buys in just a few steps, choose flexible intervals, and manage everything in one place.   No need to babysit charts or remember to place orders. It’s built for consistency, not hype.  Other exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken also offer recurring buy features, each with their own strengths.   But what I’ve noticed with Bitget is how smoothly recurring buys fit into the broader trading experience  especially if you’re already active in crypto markets and want something that just runs in the background.  Why this matters now: when BTC starts moving, emotions get loud. DCA keeps you disciplined.   You keep buying, whether the market is quiet, pumping, or pulling back.  Sometimes the smartest way to ride a Bitcoin move isn’t predicting the next candle  it’s building exposure steadily and letting time do the heavy lifting. more info on this here :https://www.bitget.com/academy/best-crypto-exchanges-for-bitcoin-recurring-buy-dollar-cost-averaging  $XRP  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"372951973","id":91418,"createdAt":"2026-01-17T17:10:10.798Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-17T17:30:10.843Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-17T15:41:22.468Z","text_content":"🔴 In 2026, the  Institutional Era isn't just a trend, it is a total overhaul of capital velocity.\n\nThe smartest play for on chain wealth isn't just holding tokens; it’s the strategic pivot into synthetic equities.\n\nBy leveraging Bitget stock futures, you can instantly rotate  $XRP or  $ETH gains into global giants like NVIDIA or TSLA, bypassing the archaic 3day bank lag of legacy brokerages.\n\nThis is the end of the siloed portfolio.
