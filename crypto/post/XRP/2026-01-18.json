Recent analysis from The Motley Fool has reignited a crucial debate: Does Ripple’s corporate success guarantee value for the $XRP  token?  The Structural Reality Gap: ⚙️ Investors must distinguish between the \"Company\" and the \"Asset.\" They are not the same:  Ripple (The Private Entity): Sells software licenses (RippleNet) to banks for messaging—think of it as a faster SWIFT. This drives Equity Value for the company, but doesn't necessarily move the token.  $XRP  (The Digital Asset): Its value is driven by ODL (On-Demand Liquidity). Only when partners use XRP as a bridge currency for settlement does it create organic buy pressure.  The Logic Check: 📊 If a bank joins RippleNet only for the messaging layer but settles in Fiat or Stablecoins (like RLUSD), the \"Headline\" is huge, but the fundamental impact on $XRP  price is neutral.  Conclusion for 2026: 🐺 In a post-CLARITY Act world, we must track ODL Volume over Partner Count. Don't trade the \"Agreement\"; trade the \"Utility.\"  What’s your take? Will the banking charter flip the switch for mandatory ODL usage?
