With $BTC  dominance still near 58%, capital remains parked in Bitcoin - but history shows this phase doesn’t last forever.  Once Bitcoin finishes a major run, money typically rotates into large-cap alts. If BTC pushes toward $175K and total market cap expands to ~$5.7T, $XRP  capturing ~8% share supports a $7.7–$8.5 valuation. Add a clean breakout above $2.70 and the $3.40 ATH, and long-term structure points to the same zone.

This is one of the strongest accumulation phases since 2021.  Even more telling: 📌 Total XRP wallets just passed 7.5 million 📌 Top 10% now hold ~2,350 XRP+ 📌 Top 1% starts near 50,000 XRP  Less supply on exchanges + broader ownership = more resistance to sharp downside moves. It doesn’t remove risk, but it does change market structure.

No transfers, no downtime, no relearning a new system every time I want exposure to a different market.  What I like most is the efficiency.
