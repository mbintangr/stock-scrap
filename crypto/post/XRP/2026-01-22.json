Institutional adoption won’t be powered by talk alone. It’ll depend on infrastructure that can route value seamlessly, reduce friction, and operate across networks without breaking.

Over the past year, Binance’s XRP reserves have dropped by nearly 45%, falling from $10.16B to $5.55B. That’s not a small fluctuation, it represents a massive amount of XRP being removed from one of the largest trading venues in the market.  When coins consistently leave exchanges at this scale, it usually signals a shift in investor behavior. Rather than keeping assets readily available to trade or sell, holders are moving XRP into self-custody or long-term storage, suggesting growing conviction.  Historically, declining exchange supply tightens available liquidity. With fewer tokens sitting on order books, it often takes less demand to move price higher once momentum returns.   In simple terms: less XRP on exchanges means less immediate sell pressure. And when selling dries up while demand eventually picks back up, the market tends to reprice aggressively. #BNBChain#  #Altcoin Season#  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373083590","id":99626,"createdAt":"2026-01-21T20:20:10.297Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-21T20:30:11.857Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-21T20:26:37.262Z","text_content":"$XRP showed strong intraday volatility over the past 24 hours, with a clear bearish reversal followed by consolidation near key support.\n\n\nAfter peaking at 1.9841 USDT price dropped sharply, closing at 1.9590 in the next hour and falling further to 1.8791.

On the XRP/USDT pair, the price failed to break through the $2.40 resistance, and with the 100-day and 200-day moving averages both pointing downward, the price is now testing the $1.80 support zone.

The fifth-largest cryptocurrency is down 11.2% in the past week and nearly 20% from its monthly high, reflecting broader crypto market weakness.\n\nThe recent decline stems from global trade jitters involving the U.S. and EU, particularly the Greenland dispute, combined with delays in the U.S. CLARITY Act, a key crypto regulation. Investor confidence has weakened: U.S. XRP ETFs saw $53.3 million in net outflows, breaking a streak of inflows totaling $70 million.\n\nThe Crypto Fear and Greed Index now sits at 24, signaling extreme fear. Historically, such low readings coincide with heightened selling pressure, suggesting bearish momentum could continue in the short term.\n\n🟢 Technical Snapshot\nXRP has fallen below a multi-month descending trendline, losing both key support and a major psychological anchor at $2.00. Technical indicators favor bears: the MACD shows a bearish crossover moving toward the zero line, while the Chaikin Money Flow hints at declining institutional inflows.\nThis setup points to a potential test of December’s low at $1.77 in the coming days.\n\n🟢 Fundamental Perspective\nDespite short-term pressure, XRP’s network is growing in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure. Monthly RWA-linked value rose 27% to over $400 million, and stablecoin market capitalization on XRPL increased by 11%.\n\n\nA sustained recovery above $2.00 could indicate that strong fundamentals are starting to counter the technical downtrend.

This month, major players like BlackRock, JPMorgan, Mastercard, and Stripe headed to London to talk about what’s really changing. These discussions are happening around the London Digital Assets Forum, where the spotlight is on CARF, the UK’s new Cryptoasset Reporting Framework.  For the first time, crypto exchanges and wallet providers are required to report user activity directly to HMRC. That gives regulators clear visibility into crypto transactions and marks a big shift away from the legal “grey area” crypto has lived in for years.  Importantly, CARF doesn’t introduce new taxes. The rules stay the same: capital gains tax applies when crypto is sold or swapped, and income tax applies to things like mining and staking. What’s changed is enforcement. With reporting now automated, compliance is no longer optional  it’s expected.  That’s exactly why institutions are watching closely. Clear rules may feel uncomfortable at first, but for big money, certainty is often the green light. ﻿$XRP  #BTC Price Analysis#  #BTC Correction Incoming?#","gravity_id":"373089621","id":100146,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T03:40:07.120Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T04:40:12.853Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T03:36:45.680Z","text_content":"$XRP is it an Sleeping beauty or maybe not even a beauty at all.","gravity_id":"373090579","id":100153,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T03:40:09.903Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T04:40:12.491Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T03:33:26.667Z","text_content":"$XRP , #XRP  remains onе of the fastest, lowest‑cost settlement tokens on the XRP Ledger, built for real‑time cross‑bоrder value transfer.

After slipping to around $88,200, BTC$BTC  quickly flipped the script and pushed back above $90,000, gaining over 2% in a single day. What sparked the move? A mix of politics, policy talk, and a very direct nod to crypto from Donald Trump at the Davos World Economic Forum.   So what happened?  During his speech, Trump doubled down on his pro-crypto stance, openly backing the CLARITY Act and repeating his goal of turning the U.S. into the “crypto capital of the world.” He also eased geopolitical nerves by stating force wouldn’t be used in the Greenland situation helping risk assets breathe again.   At the time of writing, $BTC  is hovering around $90,300, after bouncing strongly from the lows. The fact that Bitcoin was mentioned directly on a global stage like Davos didn’t go unnoticed by traders.   Why the CLARITY Act matters Markets like certainty. Talk of clearer crypto regulations instantly boosted confidence, with many seeing it as a green light for bigger institutional money to step in. Trump also framed crypto as part of a broader competition with China, adding a strategic angle to the bullish narrative.  The bigger picture This move above $90K wasn’t just a random bounce. It was a sharp reaction to improving sentiment after weeks of pressure from tariff concerns and macro uncertainty. One speech, a few key words and Bitcoin caught a bid.  For now, the bulls are back in control.

As the total crypto market cap loses $200 billion following the Jan. 6 peak of $3.21 trillion, XRP has contributed $28.21 billion to this loss, with its price down by 19.5% since Jan. 6.  \r \r XRP and the broader crypto market engineered a recovery on Jan. 13, but geopolitical tensions and market uncertainty immediately capped this upside. Amid the ongoing downtrend, retail sentiments around XRP have turned sour, with social data confirming a slip into “Extreme Fear.” However, such positions typically lead to rebounds.  This is according to a recent market commentary from crypto intelligence platform Santiment, which recently assessed the impact of the ongoing market turbulence on retail sentiment. According to Santiment, social data confirms that XRP has collapsed into extreme fear for the third time this year.  \r \r Specifically, on Jan. 20, XRP’s ratio of positive sentiments against negative sentiments broke below the 1.873 level, slipping into Extreme Fear. The ratio has continued to dip since then, currently pushing toward the 1.794 mark, as retail investors show increased panic amid XRP’s position below the pivotal $2 psychological level.  However, Santiment suggested that this sour sentiment may be a “buy signal,” citing historical data. Specifically, data indicates that each time retail sentiment slips below 1.873 and enters the “Extreme Fear” region, the XRP price often recovers from its lows. However, the extent of each rebound has varied.","gravity_id":"373096900","id":100710,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T10:00:10.583Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T10:40:13.184Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T09:56:16.744Z","text_content":"Cross-ecosystem movement is becoming the default state of crypto.

Compared to BTC staying steadier, $XRP feels like it’s still finding balance.\n#XRP #Crypto #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"373098563","id":100849,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T11:12:26.226Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T11:40:12.370Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T11:10:31.815Z","text_content":"$XRP  prophets predicted that a cat would appear on earth who would save souls It looks like this cat will soon be ascended here","gravity_id":"373098555","id":100850,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T11:12:26.625Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T11:40:12.623Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T11:05:15.558Z","text_content":"Big development for the $XRP  ecosystem.

After failing to hold above $2, price rolled over and slid toward $1.95, where it’s now consolidating. The bounce hasn’t changed the structure - it still looks more like digestion than recovery.  What stands out is the drop in participation. Spot XRP ETFs just recorded their largest daily outflow since launch, with roughly $53M leaving the market. Most of that pressure came from Grayscale’s product, while inflows elsewhere were minimal. Net result: institutional appetite remains fragile.  Derivatives data tells a similar story. Open Interest has fallen to ~$3.35B, one of the lowest levels this month. That usually means traders are stepping aside, not gearing up for upside. Less leverage, less speculation - but also less fuel for a breakout.  Right now, $XRP   is trying to stabilize, up around 1.6% on the day, but confidence is still thin. If ETF outflows continue and participation keeps drying up, downside risk stays alive. Without a clear return of demand, this consolidation could easily resolve lower rather than higher.  For now, XRP isn’t crashing - but it’s not convincing either. #Ripple  #Altcoin Season#  #XRP  #XRPETF","gravity_id":"373098618","id":100887,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T11:30:12.780Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T11:50:13.233Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T11:37:00.089Z","text_content":"$XRP   déjà vu 👀 Fear is loud again — and that’s usually when things get interesting.  Social sentiment around XRP has flipped into “Extreme Fear” after a ~19% pullback from the early-January highs. According to Santiment, retail pessimism is now at levels that have historically preceded rebounds.  This isn’t magic — it’s contrarian math. When bearish commentary becomes one-sided, marginal sellers are often exhausted. Santiment’s own track record shows these signals can be early, but they frequently appear near inflection zones, not tops.  Recent examples fit the pattern: • Fear spikes showed up before Jan’s push to ~$2.4 • Greed aligned with local exhaustion • Current fear coincides with XRP stabilizing near $1.90–$1.95  ⚠️ Caveat: extreme fear can persist if trend pressure stays heavy.

Security matters most for long-term crypto holders, especially those holding assets like $XRP. Past exchange failures proved that profits mean nothing if funds aren’t protected. In 2025, traders now prioritize platforms that emphasize transparency, strong custody, and verifiable reserves.  A secure exchange typically uses cold storage, multi-factor authentication, proof-of-reserves, and regular security audits to ensure user funds remain fully backed and safe during market volatility.   Most Secure Platforms for XRP Traders   Bitget stands out with multi-signature cold wallet storage, monthly proof-of-reserves reports showing strong asset backing, and a $600M User Protection Fund. These measures give XRP holders confidence in fund safety.  Coinbase is trusted for regulatory compliance and institutional-grade custody, storing most assets in cold wallets with insured hot wallets.  Kraken focuses on transparency and security, with a clean breach history and early adoption of proof-of-reserves.  Binance and Gemini also provide strong protections through cold storage, insurance funds, and compliance frameworks, making them reliable options for $XRP   investors.   Final Takeaway   For XRP traders, security should come before fees or features. Choosing exchanges with cold storage, audits, and reserve transparency — and combining that with personal security practices like 2FA and self-custody — is the safest way to protect long-term holdings. #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"373103058","id":101148,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T13:40:09.832Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T14:00:12.573Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T13:44:56.990Z","text_content":"📈 BitGo prices IPO at $18 per share  BitGo has set its IPO price at $18 per share to raise $212.8M ahead of its anticipated debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  #BitGo  #IPO  #NYSE  #Crypto  #Markets  $XRP    https://crypto-economy.com/bitgo-prices-ipo-at-18-raising-212-8m-ahead-of-nyse-debut/","gravity_id":"373105059","id":101162,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T13:50:11.252Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T14:10:13.640Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T13:57:13.285Z","text_content":"🚨 $XRP  Price Prediction - Falling Below $2 Due to #ETF  Outflows https://icobench.com/gr/news/ptwsi-xrp-katw-apo-duo-dolaria/","gravity_id":"373105137","id":101177,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T14:00:10.257Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T14:20:12.787Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T13:54:30.079Z","text_content":"Which crypto exchanges allow seamless bank withdrawals?  Modern crypto exchanges support a variety of fiat withdrawal rails such as ACH, SEPA, SWIFT, and Faster Payments. Still, the actual ease of moving funds from crypto to a bank account depends on how withdrawals are engineered, local banking support, and platform-specific limits.  How do exchanges design fiat off-ramp systems?  Most services convert crypto to fiat and then push funds through domestic or international banking networks. Platforms with direct bank partnerships generally offer more predictable timelines and smoother settlement.  Why do withdrawal limits vary by platform?  Limits are shaped by KYC tier, compliance requirements, and risk management models. Users with full identity verification typically gain access to higher daily caps.  How do platforms differ in banking access and withdrawal caps?  Bitget provides SEPA, SWIFT, and local transfers with higher caps for verified users and broad fiat options.  Kraken supports ACH, SEPA, and SWIFT with very high ceilings suitable for large payouts.  Coinbase focuses on ACH, SEPA, and Faster Payments with moderate limits in regulated regions.  What setup is most practical for ongoing use?  Exchanges offering direct banking rails, transparent limit structures, and solid regional coverage tend to deliver the most dependable long-term experience.  Conclusion  Bitget takes the top spot thanks to higher limits, strong banking integrations, and broader fiat support. Kraken is a close second for users needing very large withdrawals. Coinbase lands third with a simpler but more restrictive fiat setup.  FAQ 1. Are withdrawal limits the same across fiat currencies? No, limits often differ by currency, region, and banking rail.  2. Do all exchanges support every fiat currency? No, each platform offers a different mix of supported currencies and rails.  $PEPE  $XRP    #Macro Insights#  #Meme Alpha#","gravity_id":"373105122","id":101178,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T14:00:10.635Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T14:20:13.172Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T13:52:23.407Z","text_content":"⚡ Crypto News Digest: Key Updates You Need to Know  $ONDO  $XRP","gravity_id":"373100404","id":101179,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T14:00:11.006Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T14:20:13.548Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T13:50:46.941Z","text_content":"📡 StarterPacks launch on X platform  StarterPacks rolled out on X to help new users instantly access leading crypto accounts.  #Crypto  #X  #Users  #Social  #Web3  $XRP    https://crypto-economy.com/starterpacks-debut-on-x-giving-new-users-instant-access-to-top-crypto-accounts/","gravity_id":"373104190","id":101180,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T14:00:11.410Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T14:10:13.400Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T14:06:58.685Z","text_content":"The market has been giving mixed vibes these days, and staking is starting to look like a solid choice.

What’s Happening?  XRP is showing highly unusual market behaviour: during the latest price dip, short liquidations hit exactly $0, while longs were wiped out for over $200K in a single hour.   👉 First of all - no, this isn't a glitch. It suggests that bears have completely backed off or exited early, leaving the market thin. When shorts disappear during a downside move, it creates asymmetric risk - meaning volatility could explode unexpectedly.  $XRP  is currently pinned between a failed recovery and an unfinished breakdown. With liquidity gaps on both sides, small moves will have an outsized impact on price.  Key Levels to Watch: 📈 $1.95: a break above this forces shorts back in and opens the path to $1.975 📉 $1.93: if this fails, expect a fast slide toward $1.905  Market sentiment is leaning toward \"Extreme Fear\" after the recent 19% drop.

Structure: The asset is effectively range-bound until the supply at $2.00 is fully absorbed.\n\nConclusion:\nVolume precedes price. The current high volume indicates a battle between absorption (bulls) and distribution (bears) is active.\n\n\n#XRP #TechnicalAnalysis #CryptoNews #MarketData","gravity_id":"373106427","id":101488,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T16:40:10.300Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T17:10:13.914Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T16:31:40.603Z","text_content":"Elon Musk said at the World Economic Forum that artificial intelligence (AI) will outpace human thought speed by the end of this year with that timeline set for no later than next year.

That move wasn’t random. Here’s the key detail most people miss.  Research from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy shows around 96% of U.S. tariffs were paid by Americans themselves, not foreign exporters.  Tariffs act like a hidden domestic tax. Imports cost more, businesses pass expenses forward, and consumers pay the bill. Foreign companies rarely lower prices they reduce supply or shift markets.  So when tariffs return, markets react fast. It’s not politics  it’s liquidity tightening. That’s why BTC dumped. ﻿$XRP","gravity_id":"373108390","id":101534,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T17:10:08.453Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T17:30:13.280Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T17:07:49.010Z","text_content":"$XRPbuy","gravity_id":"373107417","id":101539,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T17:10:10.777Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T17:30:12.899Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T17:04:45.117Z","text_content":"UPDATE: XRP Selling Pressure Continues as Market Sentiment Turns Bearish\n\nXRP is drawing selling pressure with price down over recent trading amid broader market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty.

Developers using Privy can now integrate token swaps into TON applications in minutes by leveraging Omniston, the liquidity aggregation protocol developed by STONfi.  Privy provides wallet infrastructure that allows apps to interact with hundreds of blockchains. With official TON support now live, developers can combine embedded wallets with Omniston-powered swaps — without building custom wallet logic or swap infrastructure from scratch.  Why this matters:  🔹For developers: faster time-to-market for TON apps with built-in wallets and ready-to-use swaps  🔹For users: smoother onboarding and instant access to DeFi features directly inside applications.  🔹For the TON ecosystem: scalable infrastructure that lowers the barrier to onboarding new users and applications.  Omniston acts as the execution layer behind the scenes, routing swaps through STONfi’s aggregation logic while allowing any interface — web apps, wallets, or mini apps — to remain simple and lightweight.  This integration highlights how STONfi is evolving beyond a DEX into core infrastructure that helps TON applications scale faster and deliver better user experiences  #TON  #TON ecosystem, here to discover the latest projects#  #DeFi  #Crypto#   $XRP","gravity_id":"373106639","id":101558,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T17:20:09.734Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T17:30:12.523Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T17:28:45.245Z","text_content":"wen XRP moon is the only question on everyone’s mind.","gravity_id":"373107544","id":101573,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T17:30:10.502Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T17:50:10.802Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T17:23:24.436Z","text_content":"$XRP A challenging period awaits us, but I'm confident that rockets will launch in February and March, provided Trump allows it, of course 😁😁","gravity_id":"373107504","id":101574,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T17:30:10.884Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T17:50:12.048Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T17:20:42.684Z","text_content":"Binance Lists Ripple’s RLUSD and Expands $XRP  Pairs  Here Is Why It Matters for XRP: https://blocknews.com/binance-lists-ripples-rlusd-and-expands-xrp-pairs-here-is-why-it-matters-for-stablecoins/   #Macro Insights#  #BNBChain#  #XRP","gravity_id":"373107486","id":101575,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T17:30:11.264Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T17:50:12.429Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T17:20:21.824Z","text_content":"$XRP sobe zorraa","gravity_id":"373108475","id":101576,"createdAt":"2026-01-22T17:30:11.652Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T17:50:12.814Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-22T17:19:40.936Z","text_content":"Ripple $XRP  is experiencing short-term weakness and consolidation/pullback after a failed push toward $2, amid broader crypto market dynamics.

Bitget total IMU airdrop is 20M, while KuCoin is 9M  ﻿2. Bitget airdrop earning duration is 6 days, while Kucoin is 8 days. This means lesser duration equals more airdrops to be earned.   ﻿Remember that ImmuneFi is supported by Framework ventures, the same baker behind $PUMP e and XPL.
