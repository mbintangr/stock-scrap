Over the past 24 hours, trading volume climbed roughly 10% to $3.27 billion, even as price hovered near $1.90. On the surface, the dip looks modest (-0.73% daily), but zooming out tells a tougher story: XRP is down over 11% on the week after a seven day slide that briefly tagged $1.85. Activity is rising, yet confidence is fragile.\nZoom out further and the broader market context matters. Total crypto liquidations hit $861.9 million in the last 24 hours, with a heavy skew toward longs at $753 million. That’s not just noise it’s leverage getting flushed as optimism meets reality.\nGlassnode highlights $2 as a critical psychological and technical barrier. Recent retests of this level triggered an estimated $500 million to $1.2 billion in realized losses, as long-term holders used rallies as exit liquidity. Meanwhile, short-term holders (week to month) are largely still in profit, but the 6–12 month cohort remains underwater.

The price structure over the last 24 hours shows lower highs and lower lows, signaling temporary bearish pressure — but without any signs of panic selling.\n📉 Technical Structure:\nThe decline is gradual and well-structured, which in my view suggests market hesitation rather than weakness. This kind of price behavior often appears when smart money is observing key levels before committing.\n📊 Key Support Zones:\n• 0.00002130 BTC – Immediate reaction zone\n• 0.00002100 BTC – Critical level to maintain structure\n• 0.00002070 BTC – Potential accumulation area if tested\n📈 Upside Recovery Levels:\n• 0.00002170 BTC – First technical rebound\n• 0.00002210 BTC – Trend evaluation zone\n• 0.00002280 BTC – Bullish confirmation area\n💬 My Personal Take:\nPersonally, I don’t see this move as a breakdown. As long as XRP holds above the main support range, I consider this phase more of a reset than a reversal. Chasing price here doesn’t make sense to me — patience around support levels is where the real edge usually is.\n🔎 Outlook:\nXRP remains in a neutral-to-bearish short-term phase, but the structure still allows for a technical rebound if buyers step in at support. Confirmation, not prediction, is the key.\n\n#XRP  #CMC #CryptoAnalysis #Altcoin Season# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373122071","id":102334,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T04:50:10.543Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T06:10:13.017Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-23T05:04:58.216Z","text_content":"$XRP The future for XRP is indeed very bright!

According to the XRP wallet distribution metric, exactly 45% of wallets hold between 1 and 100 XRP worth $1.90 to $190. Additionally, those holding 100 to 1,000 XRP represent 22% of the total wallets. This confirms that the XRP market still has room for growth despite being nearly 13 years old.  Japanese XRP community member Sekairoboyashi recently shared this data, aligning with suggestions that the XRP market is still early.  Notably, despite being nearly 13 years old, XRP holders believe the crypto asset is still in an early growth phase. Since its launch, XRP has delivered an all-time gain exceeding 32,000%, yet several market commentators argue that its current adoption level leaves room for expansion.   They believe investors entering the market today may still be setting themselves up relatively early, especially when they compare XRP’s user metrics with those of older and more established cryptocurrencies.  XRP currently boasts 7.53 million wallets. In contrast, Bitcoin alone has approximately 56.8 million wallets holding between 0 and 1 BTC. This difference shows how much smaller XRP’s holder base remains, even after more than a decade of existence.   Of the 7.53 million wallets, the report from Sekairoboyashi reveals that a substantial portion of XRP wallets hold relatively small amounts of the asset.   Specifically, around 45% of all XRP wallets contain between 1 and 100 XRP, making this the largest single group of holders on the network. Meanwhile, about 22% of wallets are estimated to hold between 100 and 1,000 XRP, while another 17% fall within the 1,000 to 10,000 XRP range.   As the balances increase, the number of wallets continues to decline. Notably, about 10% of XRP wallets reportedly hold between 10,000 and 100,000 XRP. Moving up, roughly 4% of wallets control between 100,000 and 1 million XRP. At the top, wallets holding more than 1 million XRP account for less than 2% of the total.","gravity_id":"373135953","id":103355,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T15:10:10.670Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-23T15:30:12.555Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-23T15:04:43.007Z","text_content":"Banks Embrace $GRT  for Blockchain  Seeing banks toy with $GRT  for data is fine, but it is merely the plumbing.

Analysts point to profit taking after last year’s highs, combined with broader market weakness and regulatory uncertainty. The lack of fresh institutional inflows has also weighed on sentiment, pushing XRP lower despite its extensive ecosystem.  2 Catalysts That Could Trigger a Reversal Regulatory Clarity: A favorable outcome in ongoing U.S. crypto legislation could boost investor confidence and unlock new capital for XRP.  Institutional Adoption: Renewed interest from banks and payment providers leveraging Ripple’s technology could reignite demand and drive a rebound.
