About XRP Price Prediction:\nRight now, predicting XRP’s price is quite challenging due to the volatility of the crypto market. Currently, XRP is around $1.92, and some analysts suggest it could reach approximately $2.6153 by 2026 and somewhere between $6.23 to $8.53 by 2030. However, these predictions depend on several factors, including legal resolutions and blockchain adoption. Hence, investors are advised to remain cautious.\n\n\n2. On High Price Predictions (like $1000 or $5000):\nAt present, such high price points are mostly speculative and not considered practical based on current market conditions and trends. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and many factors influence prices. Therefore, most analysts view these predictions as long-term and theoretical rather than immediately feasible, and investors should be cautious.","gravity_id":"373145579","id":104145,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T23:20:10.526Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T00:30:13.183Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-23T23:21:03.185Z","text_content":"$XRP Its funny how xrp is such an obvious choice if you do a little research and yet those that own it are part of an elite group!!","gravity_id":"373145617","id":104152,"createdAt":"2026-01-23T23:30:10.867Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T00:40:13.840Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-23T23:37:20.563Z","text_content":"$BTC  Price came to a standstill after the initial Yearly open sweep.

While $BTC  stays relatively stable, XRP is now sitting right on a zone that could decide whether bulls stay in control - or lose it.  According to Gareth Soloway, the key support sits between $1.77 and $1.61. As long as that range holds, bulls still have a case. But a clean break below it could open the door to much deeper losses, with little structure underneath. On the upside, $2.20 is the first major resistance that needs to break before confidence really returns.  Soloway’s takeaway is simple: bias doesn’t matter here - levels do.

Dilip Rao, who previously held a senior role at Ripple, emphasized that the cryptocurrency's core purpose centers on enabling fast, low-cost cross-border payments and infrastructure for banks and financial institutions, not catering to short-term retail traders chasing price volatility.\n\nIn recent commentary, Rao highlighted how XRP's architecture prioritizes utility in global financial systems over retail market dynamics. He pointed out that while retail investors often view XRP through the lens of price speculation, the token's true value lies in its ability to facilitate efficient, scalable transactions for enterprises and payment providers. This focus on institutional adoption aligns with Ripple's long-standing strategy to integrate XRP into traditional finance, particularly for on-demand liquidity solutions that help bridge currencies without relying on pre-funded accounts.\n\nThe statement comes amid ongoing discussions in the crypto space about XRP's role post-regulatory clarity, with Ripple continuing to expand partnerships and push for broader institutional integration.\n\nRao's remarks serve as a reminder that XRP's design philosophy has always leaned toward enterprise-grade applications, positioning it as a bridge asset in the evolving digital economy rather than a primary vehicle for individual speculation.\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373153590","id":104494,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T07:10:11.538Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T08:10:14.511Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-24T07:22:45.100Z","text_content":"$XRP is approaching a pivotal technical zone near $1.90, where years of consolidation, renewed buying pressure, and emerging candlestick signals could signal the start of a meaningful #momentum shift.\n\nAt the time of writing, the XRP price is currently #trading around $1.92–$1.93, positioning it just above a demand zone that has been tested multiple times in recent weeks\n\nSee our full analysis here > https://t.co/wI9wzxlxIl","gravity_id":"373154375","id":104517,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T07:30:10.667Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T08:20:13.413Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-24T07:42:10.952Z","text_content":"$XRP my portfolio jan 26","gravity_id":"373153905","id":104534,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T07:50:11.075Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T08:00:12.463Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-24T07:38:42.611Z","text_content":"🇺🇸 ETF FLOWS (Jan 23 | ET):\nSpot #BTC and #ETH ETFs extended net outflows, while #SOL and $XRP saw net inflows.\n\n\n• $BTC: −$104M (5th straight outflow day)\n• $ETH: −$41.74M (4th straight outflow day)\n• $SOL: +$1.87M\n•$XRP : +$3.43M\n\n\nRotation persists.","gravity_id":"373154522","id":104535,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T07:50:11.475Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T08:30:13.766Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-24T07:56:43.557Z","text_content":"🗿 Tracking Portfolio Performance on STONfi  🩵 DeFi isn’t just about earning - it’s about understanding what you earn.

The RSI is holding below the 50 level and slightly recovering from oversold conditions, signaling weak momentum and consolidation rather than a clear reversal.  📈 Holding above 1.90 USDT could allow a modest rebound toward 1.98–2.05 USDT, where EMA resistance is expected.  📉 A breakdown below 1.88 USDT would increase downside risk toward the 1.80–1.83 USDT support zone.  📊 BingX Chart: XRP/USDT (4H)  #XRP  #Macro Insights#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"373155282","id":104612,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T08:30:10.832Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T08:50:13.043Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-24T08:36:45.265Z","text_content":"$XRP   Secures Top-Tier Allocation in Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest New ETF Filing.  Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest has filed an S-1 application with the U.S. SEC for the ARK CoinDesk 20 Crypto ETF, highlighting XRP among the fund’s most significant holdings.   The filing, submitted yesterday, underscores growing institutional confidence in diversified crypto exposure, particularly beyond Bitcoin to assets like XRP.   The proposed ETF, filed on January 23, 2026, tracks the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) Index. Notably, XRP carries a significant 19.88% weighting, making it one of the fund’s top components. The token only ranks behind Ethereum and Bitcoin, which are assigned weights of 20.69% and 32.4% in the full index, respectively.   \r \r \r Other major cryptocurrencies in the fund include Solana, Cardano, Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, Stellar, Litecoin, and Avalanche, with respective weightings of 12.88%, 2.29%, 2.25%, 1.61%, 1.20%, 1.10%, and 0.99%.   \r \r \r Meanwhile, Ark Invest will sponsor the fund, and CSC Delaware Trust will act as trustee. Notably, the fund’s shares will list and trade on NYSE Arca, Inc. The fund currently shows a nominal seed value of $100, with an expected launch capital of about $437,000.   XRP’s near-20% allocation places it firmly in the institutional spotlight. Inclusion at this scale suggests growing acceptance of XRP as a liquid, investable asset suitable for regulated products.

A prominent wealth expert argues that XRP’s value goes far beyond price speculation, warning that those betting against the asset are likely to regret it.   Although XRP plays a clear role in cross-border settlements, critics have often downplayed this utility and dismissed the token as just another speculative play. In response, XRP proponents continue to push back, stressing that its distinct design and real-world use case set it apart.  Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group (DAG), recently reinforced this view in a post on X. In his commentary, Claver emphasized that XRP was deliberately engineered with a specific purpose beyond price speculation.   He noted that while much of the crypto market has chased scarcity narratives in hopes of becoming digital gold alongside Bitcoin, XRP has taken a different path, focusing instead on solving tangible real-world problems.   Moreover, Claver pointed to historical market trends, arguing that utility ultimately outperforms hype over the long term. From this perspective, dismissing XRP as just another token overlooks the intentional choices that underpin its architecture.   Consequently, he cautioned that those who underestimate XRP’s uniqueness may regret it, particularly if they miss the point where function and purpose begin to outweigh speculation.  Notably, several members of the XRP community rallied behind Jake Claver’s commentary. One user argued that utility ultimately prevails in the market, stressing that assets with real-world applications tend to outperform speculation-driven tokens over the long term.   Similarly, another commenter maintained that utility has always been the defining factor in crypto. Despite acknowledging that mass adoption has yet to materialize fully, they emphasized that progress continues steadily.","gravity_id":"373160008","id":104783,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T10:10:11.890Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T10:50:13.992Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-24T10:19:53.757Z","text_content":"$XRPBase Building for Next Push\n\nEntry Zone: 1.900 – 1.925\nTP1: 1.98\nTP2: 2.10\nTP3: 2.28\nSL: 1.86\n#BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373157481","id":104814,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T10:30:11.057Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T11:10:13.732Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-24T10:39:27.163Z","text_content":"Which Crypto Exchanges Support Copy Trading?

However, staking isn’t one-size-fits-all. The real differences go beyond headline APYs and come down to custody, lock-up terms, withdrawal flexibility, and risk exposure. Knowing how these factors work helps you pick a platform that aligns with your goals. What to Look For Don’t focus only on rewards. Check whether staking is custodial, which assets are supported, how withdrawals work, and how flexible the options are. Each platform handles validators and reward distribution differently, so the best choice depends on whether you prioritize simplicity, liquidity, or control. Platform Structure Most staking platforms use centralized or hybrid models. Centralized exchanges offer easy, managed staking with optional lock-ups. Hybrid setups combine exchange staking with on-chain or DeFi access. These structures affect ease of use, security, and potential returns. Rewards, Lock-Ups, and Risks Flexible staking usually offers lower yields but faster access to funds. Locked staking pays more but limits liquidity. Centralized platforms involve counterparty risk, while on-chain staking adds smart-contract risk. Lock-up length and reward frequency also impact efficiency.  Conclusion In 2026, smart staking is about structure, not just APY. Bitget, Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken each serve different investor needs. By weighing custody, flexibility, and risk, you can make more sustainable staking choices.  FAQ Is staking still beginner-friendly?  What’s the main risk in centralized staking?  Do rewards change? ﻿source: https://www.bitget.com/academy/top-10-best-crypto-staking-platforms","gravity_id":"373158223","id":104850,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T10:50:11.481Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T11:20:13.620Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-24T10:55:49.954Z","text_content":"While everyone debates which chart will move first, structure is quietly forming.\r \r $XRP  has been compressing for months, building a base that usually precedes expansion.

The Privy and Omniston integration moves TON in that direction by making swaps and wallet interactions feel like native app features rather than external steps.   \r \r With Omniston handling TON liquidity aggregation under the hood, Privy-enabled apps can execute swaps using optimal routing without exposing complexity to either developers or users. This abstraction is critical for mainstream onboarding, especially in Telegram-native environments where expectations are closer to Web2 simplicity.\r \r For developers, the impact is practical. Instead of stitching together wallet SDKs, swap contracts, and routing logic, they can rely on ready-made recipes that demonstrate real execution flows using Vite and React. That speeds up iteration and reduces integration risk.    \r \r From an ecosystem perspective, this matters because it scales beyond a single app. Infrastructure that can be reused across many applications compounds its value. Each new Privy-powered app becomes another entry point into $TON  DeFi without forcing users through traditional friction points.    \r \r Positively framed, this integration shows $TON  evolving from a network of tools into a network of experiences, where infrastructure fades into the background and usability takes the lead.    \r \r Read more here: https://docs.privy.io/recipes/community/ton-omniston-swap     #TON  #Notcoin  #Altcoin Season#  $TON  $XRP","gravity_id":"373160273","id":104867,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T11:00:10.585Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T11:40:13.802Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-24T11:08:21.519Z","text_content":"LATEST: ⚡ Shark Tank investor Kevin O'Leary argues that the underlying electricity powering #Bitcoin  mining can be more valuable than the $BTC  itself, as owning the power gives you the option to either mine or lease it out.  ﻿#Altcoin Season#  $XRP  #Meme Alpha#","gravity_id":"373161355","id":104899,"createdAt":"2026-01-24T11:20:10.056Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-24T12:10:13.166Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-24T11:16:06.950Z","text_content":"$XRP  president: half of Fortune 500 companies will use crypto  By the end of 2026, around half of the Fortune 500 companies—the 500 largest companies in the United States,will be actively using crypto or the underlying blockchain technology.
