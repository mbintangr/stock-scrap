Analysts noted a breakout on Friday, as a 4-hour candle closed above a recent downward trendline. This move suggests two possibilities: it could be the start of a genuine upward shift, leading XRP to test higher price levels, or a temporary \"fakeout\" that traps buyers before another decline.\n\nThe focus is on a falling wedge pattern, which often precedes significant rallies. While a retest of the pattern's strong support near $1.80 was expected, the recent breakout hints the downtrend may already be ending. If confirmed, this pattern could propel XRP back toward $2.40—matching its peak from early 2026.\n\nHowever, the path upward faces several hurdles. Initial resistance sits around $1.97, followed by the key psychological barrier at $2.00.

If we see manipulation and a sharp recovery below 1.8873, that could be your signal for a reversal long towards 1.9100 and 1.9242. - If price approaches 1.9242 and gets rejected with strong bearish formations, expect a move back down to 1.9100 and 1.8873. - For a bullish outlook, we would need a decisive break and close above 1.9242, targeting 1.9656 next. - Trade example: If price dips below 1.8873, watch lower timeframes for a quick reclaim with bullish candles or a strong engulfing. Enter long on the confirmation, target 1.9100 and 1.9242. Stop-loss at the swing low. - Bias changes to bullish only if price holds above 1.9242 with strong volume and momentum, aiming for the 1.9656 level.  📝 This is not investment advice, just an educational report based on the current structure.
