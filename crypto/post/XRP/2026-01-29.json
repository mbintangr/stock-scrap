When winter hits and energy supplies get tight, prices especially natural gas tend to jump, and that pressure spreads across the market. That’s usually when things shift from “wait and see” to “act quickly and be smart.”  When that happens, money often moves out of slower, passive investments and into safer options. Energy, metals, and especially gold start to look more attractive when things feel uncertain. At the same time, riskier assets tend to cool off, since stability matters more than chasing big wins.  I’ve personally been focusing more on commodities and metals, trading through Bitget TradFi. Gold hitting a new all-time high has worked out well for me, and with the Bitget TradFi $XAUt  trading competition running right now, it makes the setup even more interesting.  At the end of the day, it’s all about paying attention. Markets move in cycles, and spotting a shift early isn’t just about making money it’s also about protecting what you’ve already built. ﻿$XRP  #BTC Price Analysis#  #CMC Quest: Earn Rewards#","gravity_id":"373285821","id":107457,"createdAt":"2026-01-28T18:10:09.600Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-28T18:20:09.850Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-28T18:14:08.977Z","text_content":"Coins with identical pumps across 3 different exchanges simultaneously = coordinated buying.

According to popular crypto analyst Coach JV, this divergence is only temporary. He believes the cryptocurrencies could soon experience a price explosion similar to that of precious metals.  Analysts attribute the rally in gold and silver mainly to geopolitical tensions, ongoing purchases by central banks, and rising industrial demand—especially for silver.  Paper markets suppress prices Coach JV argues that more is going on beneath the surface. In his view, both silver and crypto have been artificially suppressed for years by paper markets such as futures and derivatives, which mask the true underlying demand for these assets.  “What’s happening to silver will happen to Bitcoin and XRP,” he says. “Paper markets suppress price… until reality hits.”  He does not give a specific timeline and avoids making precise predictions. But his warning is clear: if this suppression disappears, prices will not rise gradually, they could surge sharply in a very short period of time.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Altcoin Season#","gravity_id":"373302021","id":108445,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T07:10:07.036Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T08:00:10.911Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T07:06:45.638Z","text_content":"🚀 XRP “Millionaire” Wallets Rise Despite Modest Price Dip: Santiment    XRP “millionaire” wallets are rising again despite a modest price dip, signaling renewed long-term confidence among large holders. #crypto  $XRP","gravity_id":"373302035","id":108461,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T07:20:09.214Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T08:00:10.604Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T07:31:00.073Z","text_content":"$XRP  Long Setup (1H)\n\nEntry: 1.90 – 1.92\nBullish above: 1.89\nSL: 1.84\n\nTP1: 1.95\nTP2: 2.02\nTP3: 2.10","gravity_id":"373302218","id":108482,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T07:40:09.058Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T08:10:14.405Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T07:49:45.061Z","text_content":"🚨BREAKING: 🇺🇸 $XRP spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of $9.16M on January 28.

However, at press time, Grok has not responded to 21Shares’ inquiry about XRP’s price in 2026.  Interestingly, in the comment section of 21Shares’ post, Grok has been responding to other questions about price predictions for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. \r \r For instance, in response to X user TheGhostShade, Grok said Bitcoin could reach $250,000 this year, citing Tom Lee’s outlook, while also noting a bearish scenario of $75,000.  Meanwhile, for Ethereum, Grok cited CoinCodex’s $3,900 outlook and Changelly’s $6,100 target for 2026. It also referenced the aggressive $62,000 price prediction for Ethereum popularized by Tom Lee.  \r \r Yet, despite repeated questions about XRP’s price, Grok has not responded to any of them under 21Shares’ post as of press time.  \r \r XRP supporters have taken note of this and expressed frustration, questioning why Grok is addressing ETH and BTC price predictions while ignoring XRP.  \r \r “I find it strange Grok repeatedly replies to price predictions for both BTC and ETH but won’t answer the XRP price questions,” remarked X user SharkPixl Retouching. She went on to ask whether there is something preventing Grok from commenting on XRP’s future.","gravity_id":"373302780","id":108585,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T08:40:08.629Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T09:00:10.979Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T08:47:33.534Z","text_content":"Hang Seng launches physical gold ETF with tokenization option 31 minutes ago Hang Seng plans to offer tokenized gold fund units recorded on public blockchains, though the product remains subject to regulatory approval and will not trade on secondary markets.  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#   ﻿$BTC  $XRP","gravity_id":"373304046","id":108591,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T08:50:05.522Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T09:10:11.608Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T08:44:26.023Z","text_content":"[{\"sourceId\":\"697b1d057038f569e6c2cc24\",\"tldr\":\"Ripple enhances institutional finance with its Ripple Treasury platform, leveraging blockchain for swift cross-border transactions.\",\"url\":\"https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-rolls-out-treasury-platform-integrating-traditional-and-digital-assets/\",\"relevantWord\":\"Ripple Treasury platform\",\"score\":\"8.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"697b1cf87038f569e6c2cbf7\",\"tldr\":\"FXRP's launch on Hyperliquid advances XRP's DeFi integration with Ripple Treasury optimizing corporate finance through blockchain.\",\"url\":\"https://news.bitcoin.com/flare-positions-fxrp-as-xrps-asset-of-choice-on-hyperliquid\",\"relevantWord\":\"XRP's DeFi integration\",\"score\":\"8.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"697b1d017038f569e6c2cc19\",\"tldr\":\"A class action against Ripple was dismissed by the Ninth Circuit, ruling XRP claims were time-barred under securities law.\",\"url\":\"https://u.today/shiba-inu-burn-rate-slumps-99-will-price-recovery-stall\",\"relevantWord\":\"class action against Ripple\",\"score\":\"8.0\"},{\"sourceId\":\"697b1d017038f569e6c2cc1d\",\"tldr\":\"Ripple integrates XRP into global treasury systems for seamless cross-border payments and enhanced financial liquidity.\",\"url\":\"https://news.bitcoin.com/fidelity-moves-deeper-into-crypto-with-proprietary-stablecoin\",\"relevantWord\":\"XRP into global treasury systems\",\"score\":\"8.0\"}]","gravity_id":"373305257","id":108595,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T08:50:08.801Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T09:00:10.786Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T08:54:21.412Z","text_content":"$XRP is trading around ~$1.85–$1.90 USD right now, showing modest moves without a major breakout.\n\n\nMorgan Stanley has taken a significant step into the digital asset space by appointing a Head of Digital Asset Strategy.\n\n\nThis move signals a deeper commitment from traditional finance to crypto, blockchain, and digital infrastructure.\n\n\nAreas that were once considered niche are now becoming central to long-term investment and product development.\n\n\n#MorganStanley #BingX","gravity_id":"373304162","id":108619,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T09:00:09.554Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T09:20:11.562Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T08:52:12.596Z","text_content":"XRP Millionaire Wallets Turn Positive for the First Time Since September - A Quiet Accumulation Signal  While the broader crypto market remains range-bound, $XRP  is flashing a subtle but important on-chain signal. For the first time since September, the number of XRP wallets holding ≥1M tokens is increasing - a shift that often precedes volatility rather than follows it.  This change matters not for its size, but for its direction. Large holders appear to be repositioning before price reacts - classic pre-expansion behavior rather than momentum chasing.  $XRP  remains locked in consolidation, capped below the $2.00 area, with muted volumes and no confirmed higher highs. That divergence is notable: historically, large wallets tend to accumulate during low-volatility phases, with price lagging until broader demand kicks in.  Technically, a demand zone is absorbing sell pressure near support, while supply above the range keeps price constrained below $2. Momentum indicators (MACD) are approaching a potential bullish crossover, but confirmation is missing.  The return of XRP millionaire wallets signals a medium-term accumulation thesis, not a confirmed trend reversal. Until price and volume validate the on-chain shift, this remains a developing setup - one businesses, investors, and innovators should monitor closely rather than front-run.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Bitcoin Price Prediction: What is Bitcoins next move?#","gravity_id":"373305461","id":108620,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T09:00:09.863Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T09:20:11.882Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T08:50:51.675Z","text_content":"$BTC  According to reports, Russia plans to implement comprehensive crypto regulations by July 2027. ﻿$XRP  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373305451","id":108621,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T09:00:10.172Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T09:10:11.270Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T09:07:53.690Z","text_content":"$XRP  — DESCENDING CHANNEL CONTINUES TO PRESS PRICE  Ripple remains trapped within a well-defined descending channel after failing to reclaim prior structural highs.

XRP is showing a subtle but important on-chain shift as large holders quietly return.   While price action remains relatively muted, wallet data suggests confidence among long-term investors may be rebuilding.  According to Santiment, the number of XRP wallets holding at least 1 million tokens has started to rise again for the first time since September.  Santiment data shows that XRP “millionaire” wallets declined steadily between early October and the end of December, with roughly 784 large holders exiting during that period.  However, that trend has now changed.  Since January 1, a net of 42 new wallets holding 1 million XRP or more have been added back to the ledger. This marks the first sustained increase in four months and suggests that high-balance investors are slowly returning.  Historically, changes in large wallet counts are closely watched because they often reflect long-term positioning rather than short-term trading.  Despite this accumulation trend, XRP’s price performance has been modest. Santiment notes that XRP is down around 4% since the start of 2026, indicating that the renewed growth in large wallets is not driven by price hype.  This divergence between price and on-chain accumulation is often interpreted as a sign of quiet confidence. Instead of chasing momentum, larger holders appear to be positioning during consolidation.","gravity_id":"373311037","id":109149,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T13:30:10.149Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T13:40:12.339Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T13:20:16.802Z","text_content":"$XRP /USDT — BULLISH  Price has reacted strongly from the key support at 1.8660, showing clear buying interest.

According to the latest reports from Santiment, the number of \"Millionaire\" wallets (addresses holding at least 1 million $XRP ) has just hit a four-month high.  The Whale Divergence Since January 1, 2026, a net total of 42 new millionaire addresses have returned to the ledger.

This accumulation is happening while the price of $XRP  remains suppressed, down approximately 4% since the start of the year.

I would focus on shorting after a weak rally up into resistance/supply around 1.8654-1.8741, provided you see bearish confirmation (like a pin bar, lower timeframe reversal, or clear rejection). - Entry: After a bearish confirmation in the 1.8654-1.8741 area. - Take profit targets: 1.8111, 1.8000, and 1.7700. - Place your stop-loss just above the swing high that forms during the pullback/rejection. - If price unexpectedly breaks above 1.8900 and holds, especially above 1.9156, I would reconsider the bearish bias and look for possible reversal setups. - Watch for signs of manipulation or liquidity sweep around the most recent swing lows (1.8111 and lower)—a sharp move below 1.8111 followed by a strong reversal could offer a countertrend trade, but only with clear bullish confirmation.  📝 This is not investment advice, only an educational report!

The Invisible Wall: A heavy supply cluster of 1.86 billion XRP sits between $1.96 and $1.98. This acts as a \"break-even\" sell zone for millions of holders, capping every rally. 2. Volume Gap: XRP recently reclaimed the 20-EMA ($1.94), but failed to hold. Unlike the early January surge (+28%), current attempts lack the 330% surge in exchange outflows needed to absorb the wall. 3. Whale Activity: Mid-tier whales (10M–100M XRP) added 160M tokens this week, but it’s not yet enough to overwhelm the nearly 2 billion tokens waiting to be sold at $1.98.  🛡️ Critical Levels: A 12-hour close above $1.99 triggers a run to $2.19. Falling below $1.80 invalidates the recovery and risks a drop to $1.46.  Can whales and ETF buyers absorb the 1.86B sell wall before the $1.80 floor snaps?

Normally, I'm all-in on crypto, mainly BTC and $XRP  but lately, their momentum felt flat. I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try something new, which led me to the TradFi Gold Trading Competition on Bitget.  In the past, I used to focus too heavily on one market, assuming crypto was enough. But markets move in cycles, and opportunities arise where you least expect. TradFi assets like $XAUt  offer stability and clearer reactions to macro trends, inflation, rates, global uncertainty. So I added it as a balance, not a replacement. The result has been eye-opening, showing me how much diversification helps.  Bitget UEX upgrade made it even better, trading gold while watching crypto, all in one place. I’m still bullish on crypto long-term, but now I’m more strategic, using TradFi to stay active during quieter crypto phases. This wasn't about leaving crypto behind; it was about evolving as a trader. And so far, it’s been completely worth it. ﻿#Macro Insights#  #Gold","gravity_id":"373317794","id":109798,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T17:50:08.995Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T17:50:08.995Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T17:42:32.552Z","text_content":"$XRP just flushed into a key demand zone near $1.80 on the 1H. \n\nSharp downside move, rising volume, and long lower wicks signal sell-side exhaustion. \n\nIf this level holds, a technical rebound toward the prior range is likely. \n\nDips like this favor patient buyers over panic sellers.","gravity_id":"373315957","id":109800,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T17:50:09.528Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T17:50:09.528Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T17:40:14.980Z","text_content":"$XRP  globalists punishing us because of trump fuck the wef","gravity_id":"373318099","id":109801,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T17:50:09.843Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T17:50:09.843Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T17:38:20.566Z","text_content":"$BTC  SEC Chair Paul Atkins says it’s the right time to allow crypto in the $12.5 trillion 401(k) retirement market. ﻿$XRP  #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373318094","id":109802,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T17:50:10.161Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T17:50:10.161Z"}]
