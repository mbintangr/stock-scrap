Instead of prioritizing DeFi composability or experimentation, it focused on efficiency, settlement speed, and alignment with institutional payment flows. This design choice has made XRP less reactive to short-term trends, but more resilient to long-term structural shifts in the market.  As crypto ecosystems expand, holders of assets like $XRP  increasingly think beyond simple holding. Capital today is managed dynamically, even when the underlying thesis remains conservative.

As crypto infrastructure evolves, assets like $XRP  and protocols like STONfi highlight a broader pattern - long-term value is often preserved by focus, while long-term participation is enabled by adaptability.  #XRP  #Blockchain  #Crypto  #MarketStructure  #Web3","gravity_id":"373321379","id":110018,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T19:30:10.470Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T19:40:10.980Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T19:22:04.512Z","text_content":"BREAKING: $XRP WINS AGAIN.\n\n\nLAWSUIT AGAINST RIPPLE DROPPED","gravity_id":"373319551","id":110019,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T19:30:10.801Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T19:40:11.300Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T19:21:32.240Z","text_content":"📈 XRPL hits major ecosystem milestone  XRPL surpasses $1B as Ethereum continues to dominate across core blockchain metrics.  #XRPL  #Ethereum  #DeFi  #Crypto  $XRP    https://crypto-economy.com/xrpl-breaks-1b-barrier-but-ethereum-still-towers-above/","gravity_id":"373318704","id":110020,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T19:30:11.001Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T19:40:11.646Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T19:17:33.447Z","text_content":"🇺🇸 ETF FLOWS: ETH, SOL and XRP spot ETFs saw net inflows on Jan. 28, while BTC spot ETFs saw net outflows.  $BTC  : - $19.64M ETH: $28.1M SOL: $6.69M $XRP  : $6.95M","gravity_id":"373319516","id":110021,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T19:30:11.549Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T19:30:11.549Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T19:28:45.047Z","text_content":"Investing in $ETH and $XRP right now? 😂 Just think of it as a really expensive game of “will they, won’t they!” \n\nReady for a plot twist? 🌀  \n\n👉 https://theccpress.com/zkp-reframes-the-best-crypto-to-buy-narrative-with-500x-potential-as-xrp-and-eth-weigh-breakout-risks  \n\n#CryptoHumor #InvestSmart #ZKP #CryptoMeme #MarketWatch ","gravity_id":"373318745","id":110030,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T19:40:03.806Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T19:40:10.438Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T19:39:36.945Z","text_content":"XRP price hasn’t been exciting lately, but the on-chain data tells a different story.

If not, XRP likely stays range-bound a bit longer.  #XRP  #Ripple   #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373324208","id":110281,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T21:50:06.179Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T22:30:10.591Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T21:45:27.731Z","text_content":"$XRP buy the dip they say 🙄😂","gravity_id":"373323236","id":110289,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T21:50:09.019Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T22:30:10.911Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T22:17:35.542Z","text_content":"$XRP   10/10 lows we bounce...","gravity_id":"373325166","id":110320,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T22:20:09.404Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T23:00:11.693Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T22:06:31.430Z","text_content":"$XRP Y'all be careful trying to buy here, this Asian open may not be friendly 🥶","gravity_id":"373325112","id":110321,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T22:20:09.727Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T22:50:10.935Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T22:01:03.367Z","text_content":"LATEST: 📉 $BTC  fell below $85,000 on Thursday to hit its lowest level in over a month as gold reversed its surge above $5,600, dropping nearly 10% in minutes and triggering broad selloffs across crypto and tech stocks.  ﻿#BTC Price Analysis#  $XRP  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373324254","id":110322,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T22:20:10.044Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T22:50:11.147Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T22:28:49.612Z","text_content":"$XRP  1.

For years, I watched gold climb and hesitated, thinking “it’s already too high.” That hesitation cost me earlier opportunities.  This time was different. With momentum building and uncertainty rising, I chose to trade gold instead of fighting the trend. Bitget TradFi made that decision easier. It opened the door for crypto traders like me to trade gold, forex, stocks, $SOL  , $XRP  , and more from one platform, using one USDT balance no app juggling, no extra friction.  I jumped into gold when it was already above $4,000/oz through Bitget TradFi. The ride hasn’t been smooth, but it’s been disciplined. Instead of shorting highs or FOMO-buying tops, I focused on managing risk and trading momentum.  That mindset is also why I joined the Bitget TradFi Gold Trading Competition (Phase 2). When markets are moving and the tools are right, the goal isn’t prediction it’s participation with control.  Lesson learned: don’t fear strong trends. Respect them, manage risk, and trade smart.  join the bitget tradfi gold competition here: https://www.bitget.com/launchhub/trading-club/232979","gravity_id":"373330077","id":110345,"createdAt":"2026-01-29T22:40:09.896Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-29T23:30:12.129Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-29T22:39:01.365Z","text_content":"XRP Millionaire Wallets Grow in 2026  The XRP cryptocurrency is struggling to find its footing as its price momentum continues to slow.

Introduction Crypto OTC trading desks serve institutions and high net worth traders who need to execute large crypto like $BTC  or $XRP  transactions without affecting public market prices. In 2026, OTC platforms remain essential for privacy, liquidity, and efficient settlement. Common desks include Bitget, Coinbase Prime, Binance, Kraken, Bybit, OKX, and crypto(.)com.  What is a crypto OTC trading platform? OTC platforms enable large trades to be executed privately rather than through public order books, reducing slippage, avoiding market signaling, and allowing fixed pricing. They are widely used by hedge funds, corporations, and professional traders.  Why do institutions use OTC desks? Institutions use OTC desks to avoid price impact, access negotiated pricing, settle faster, and trade with broader fiat support than standard exchange interfaces.  Which OTC platforms are most used in 2026? • Bitget: Global access, multi fiat, manual and RFQ • Coinbase Prime: U.S. regulated institutions • Binance: Global liquidity via RFQ • Kraken: Compliance focused with strong fiat support • Bybit and OKX: Crypto native automated RFQ • crypto(.)com: Corporate and VIP services  What does Bitget offer as an OTC desk? Bitget provides zero fee OTC execution, same day settlement, broad fiat support, and access to many digital assets, making it suitable for treasury operations and large conversions.  Which OTC desk is best? The best choice depends on regulation, fiat needs, and execution style. Bitget stands out for combining global access, zero fees, and flexible settlement.  Frequently Asked Questions OTC minimums vary by platform. OTC trades reduce market impact but rely on platform security. Most desks support major fiat currencies. OTC trades are private but may still be recorded on chain. https://www.bitget.com/academy/best-crypto-otc-desks-institutional-trading-platforms-reviewed","gravity_id":"373331137","id":110540,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T01:50:08.577Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T03:00:13.373Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-30T01:59:41.655Z","text_content":"$XRPTo the mo...🥴","gravity_id":"373331293","id":110557,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T02:00:09.792Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T02:20:09.897Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-30T02:06:17.649Z","text_content":"$XRP Bring it down some more, let's suck BTC dry!

Start Trading the Math.  The hardest lesson in crypto? You don’t need to predict the price of $BTC  to make money.

According to him, the company consistently places XRPL at the center of every exchange engagement. However, he noted that technical readiness explains why Ethereum integrations go live first. Judges confirmed that exchanges are already working toward XRPL support.  While Ripple deployed RLUSD on the XRPL and Ethereum, some believe the firm is prioritizing Ethereum.  \r RLUSD currently has a circulating market cap of $1.450 billion across both Ethereum and the XRP Ledger.  \r More than $1.112 billion worth of RLUSD circulates on Ethereum, while roughly $337 million sits on XRPL.  \r Binance recently launched RLUSD support on Ethereum, with XRPL integration planned for a later date.  \r Ripple’s Luke Judges says every exchange onboarding RLUSD will either support XRPL at launch or has formally committed to integrating it.  \r According to him, faster Ethereum rollouts come due to existing infrastructure, not a lack of focus on XRPL","gravity_id":"373333950","id":110947,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T06:10:10.992Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T06:40:10.573Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-30T06:02:17.501Z","text_content":"$XRP\nHolding long and strong....WILL NOT SELL!!!!!","gravity_id":"373334107","id":110948,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T06:10:11.318Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T06:40:10.775Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-30T06:01:26.050Z","text_content":"$XRP ...New Fed Chair...announcement today Friday Jan30...???

Many investors are exploring passive income and savings options in crypto to grow their assets over time with minimal daily involvement.\nUnderstanding Crypto Passive Income\nCrypto passive income allows users to earn rewards by staking, lending, or supporting blockchain networks. Instead of actively buying and selling, users earn returns simply by holding or allocating their crypto assets wisely.\n\nCrypto as a Savings Option\nCrypto savings involve holding digital assets on platforms that offer interest or rewards. While these options can provide higher returns than traditional savings accounts, they also come with market volatility and platform risks.\n\nRisks to Keep in Mind\nMarket fluctuations can affect asset value\nPlatforms are not government-insured\nHigher returns often involve higher risk\nBeing informed is essential before participating.\n\nCONCLUSION \nCrypto passive income and savings present modern financial opportunities, but they require awareness, research, and caution. A balanced approach and long-term mindset are key to navigating this evolving space.\n\nFAQ\nIs crypto passive income risk-free?\nNo, all crypto investments involve some level of risk.\nCan beginners explore crypto savings?\nYes, with proper research and basic understanding.\n\nSource; https://www.bitget.com/academy/top-crypto-savings-accounts-for-earning-interest-with-high-apy\n $BTC  $XRP #BTC Price Analysis#","gravity_id":"373335216","id":111012,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T06:50:10.830Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T07:10:10.214Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-30T06:41:30.373Z","text_content":"🇺🇸 ETF FLOWS (Jan 29 | ET): Broad net outflows across major spot crypto ETFs.\n\n\n• $BTC: −$817.87M\n• $ETH: −$155.61M\n• $SOL: −$2.22M\n• $XRP : -$92.92M\n\n\nRisk-off positioning accelerates.","gravity_id":"373334389","id":111013,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T06:50:11.174Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T07:00:09.854Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-30T06:41:18.304Z","text_content":"XRP Price Slips: Why the Altcoin is Stuck Below $2 👀  🟠 $XRP   struggles to break past $2 as selling pressure and market rotation keep the altcoin under control.

I tried xStocks on STONfi out of curiosity — and the experience was surprisingly simple. No brokers, no waiting for market hours, no complicated setup. Just a wallet, a swap, and you’re holding a tokenized version of a real-world asset on TON.  What stood out to me:  everything stays self-custodial — assets remain in your wallet  swaps work 24/7, not tied to TradFi schedules  execution feels fast and straightforward, especially with TON’s low fees  This feels less like a “feature demo” and more like a glimpse of where DeFi is heading — when real-world assets quietly become part of on-chain portfolios without friction.  Not saying this replaces traditional markets. But as an option inside DeFi, xStocks on STONfi actually make sense.

Vet further described XRPL as neutral, borderless, and censorship-resistant, emphasizing that it is not controlled by any single country, institution, or ideology.  In effect, the ledger continues to function as a global settlement layer that remains accessible and resilient to external pressures. Based on these attributes, he characterized XRPL as next-generation financial infrastructure.  Notably, Vet shared a short clip showing the ledger closing blocks with transactions within seconds. For context, a block closure on XRPL means that independent validators have reached consensus on transaction order and outcomes, finalizing a new, immutable network state.  Unlike Bitcoin, which mines blocks, XRPL closes a new block in seconds, creating a continuous, high-speed record of network activity.","gravity_id":"373339372","id":111212,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T08:40:09.535Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T08:50:11.253Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-30T08:30:00.151Z","text_content":"$XRP , XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger.

Former Ripple CTO David Schwartz said anyone who truly believed XRP had that kind of upside would actively buy the token at current levels and would refuse to sell it below $10. According to Schwartz, the fact that many investors continue to sell XRP under that price shows that most individuals do not believe in the XRP to $100 claims.  He made these remarks during a discussion on X. Specifically, a Ripple supporter urged Schwartz to directly tell XRP holders that prices between $50 and $100 would never happen. The individual argued that extreme price expectations had caused many investors to lose money after putting too much faith in unrealistic targets.  In response, the Ripple CTO emeritus said he does not feel comfortable stating that XRP could never reach those levels, even though he personally believes such scenarios are unlikely. He explained that his own experience in crypto taught him to remain cautious about dismissing price outcomes.  \r \r Schwartz called attention to the past, when he believed XRP would never reach $0.25, admitting that he began selling his holdings at around $0.10 because prices already seemed unreasonable. He also pointed to Bitcoin’s early days, reminding participants that many people once viewed a $100 Bitcoin as an impossible goal.  However, Schwartz suggested that if many rational investors believed XRP had even a 10% chance of reaching $100 within a few years, they would not sell significant amounts at current prices. Instead, those investors would quickly buy up available supply below $10.  \r \r Schwartz explained that buyers with that level of conviction would value XRP much more highly than current sellers. As a result, XRP priced far below $10 would disappear from the market. Since this has not happened, he concluded that very few people truly believe XRP has a meaningful chance of hitting $100 within that timeframe.","gravity_id":"373345028","id":111405,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T10:10:09.460Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T10:30:11.919Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-30T10:03:53.538Z","text_content":"MACRO SHOCK NUKES $XRP BELOW $1.8250\n\n\nThe $1.8250 support level is gone.\n\n\nA market wide selloff triggered a liquidation cascade, flushing $XRP down to $1.76.

Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg says 2026 is unlikely to deliver a new all-time high for XRP - not because the story is broken, but because the cycle isn’t ready.  McClurg believes the four-year cycle is still intact, with Bitcoin’s influence keeping most assets moving together. He expects BTC to face more downside first, possibly falling up to 30% from recent levels, with a bottom forming later this year. That kind of move, he says, would likely weigh on the entire market.  Still, $XRP  isn’t being written off. McClurg sees it as one of the few assets tied to real financial infrastructure - tokenization, stablecoins, and institutional rails.

David Schwartz brings some cold math 🧠📉  Ex-Ripple CTO David “JoelKatz” Schwartz pushed back on viral $50–$100 XRP calls — not with hype, but with market logic.  His point is simple: price is already a vote. If rational capital truly believed there was even a 10% chance XRP hits $100 in a few years, supply below $10 would dry up fast. It hasn’t. That gap matters.  Schwartz isn’t saying $100 is impossible — crypto has surprised everyone before (including him). But he argues that markets are mostly rational, and big bull runs usually come from unpredictable external shifts, not widely advertised certainties.  He also revisited XRPL economics: 🔹 Lower XRP price can actually make payments less efficient (more units needed) 🔹 Scaling isn’t just about TPS — pushing it higher shifts costs to node operators 🔹 Better goal: increase value per transaction, not spam volume  📌 Takeaway: narratives are loud, capital is honest.

The agenda is heavy on regulated finance, not hype.  What’s on the table:  Regulated XRP products (ETFs / ETPs)  Wrapped XRP & cross-chain expansion  XRPL programmability, privacy & compliance upgrades  Native lending and DeFi tooling  XRP’s role in tokenized finance & capital markets  Brad Garlinghouse, Monica Long, David Schwartz - all confirmed. There’s even a dedicated session on XRP ↔ Solana interoperability, which signals broader multi-chain ambitions rather than ecosystem isolation.  Context matters: XRP is already being discussed by regulators, banks, and institutions.

Ripple CTO Emeritus David Schwartz has clarified his long-standing view that XRP cannot remain “dirt cheap.”  He explained that a lower XRP price can actually make the asset more expensive to use for payments and exchanges.  The clarification came after an X user revisited Schwartz’s 2017 remarks, asking what he meant when he previously suggested that XRP “can’t be dirt cheap.”  In response, Schwartz said the idea is often misunderstood, stressing that a low XRP price increases the cost of using the network rather than reducing it.  According to Schwartz, when XRP is priced lower, users need a much larger number of tokens to move value across the network. This increases friction for payments and exchanges, especially at scale.  \r \r In contrast, a higher XRP price allows the same value to be transferred using fewer tokens, making transactions more efficient. Specifically, it requires roughly 1 million XRP to move $1 million in value if XRP is at $1. However, if XRP were at $100 per coin, it would require only 10,000 tokens to move the same $1 million.  \r \r In other words, price and utility are closely related. For large payments, using millions of XRP units can create market impact, while higher prices reduce the number of tokens required for settlement.  The question followed a recent exchange in which a community member urged Schwartz to publicly dismiss XRP price targets of $50 to $100.  \r \r Schwartz declined to make definitive price statements, noting that he has been wrong before when estimating how high crypto assets could go.  \r \r He referenced past moments in crypto history when price levels once considered impossible were eventually reached, including Bitcoin’s early milestones and XRP’s own rise during previous market cycles.","gravity_id":"373350267","id":111860,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T13:40:08.907Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T14:10:10.717Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-30T13:37:53.159Z","text_content":"⚖️ Clarity Act advances in Senate  The Senate Agriculture Committee approved the Clarity Act by a 12-11 vote.  #ClarityAct  #Senate  #Crypto  #Regulation  $XRP    https://crypto-economy.com/senate-ag-committee-advances-clarity-act-after-12-11-vote/","gravity_id":"373344910","id":111861,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T13:40:09.247Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T14:10:11.045Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-30T13:37:43.943Z","text_content":"MACRO SHOCK NUKES $XRP BELOW $1.8250\n\n\nThe $1.8250 support level is gone.\n\n\nA market wide selloff triggered a liquidation cascade, flushing $XRP down to $1.76.

The speed and strength of this move point to emotional selling rather than a slow, controlled downtrend. After reaching this zone, XRP showed a clear reaction with buyers stepping in, long lower wicks forming, and selling pressure beginning to slow. This highlights 1.68–1.72 as an important demand area where buyers are willing to defend price.\n\nFollowing this reaction, XRP bounced back toward the 1.76–1.78 zone and is now trying to stabilize. This move higher should be seen as a relief bounce, not a confirmed trend reversal. On the higher timeframe, XRP is still trading below major resistance, so the broader structure remains bearish despite the short-term recovery.\n\nThe 1.76–1.80 area is the key zone to watch on the upside. This region acted as support before the breakdown and is now likely to act as resistance. As long as XRP stays below this zone, sellers remain in control and downside pressure can continue. A clean break above 1.80 could open a move toward 1.85–1.88, but that area should be treated as a reaction zone, not a signal of trend change.\n\nOn the downside, a loss of 1.70–1.68 with strong volume would invalidate the bounce idea and could push price toward 1.62–1.60, where the next reaction may occur.\n\nIf you are already in shorts from higher levels, this bounce does not invalidate the bearish bias, but risk should be managed carefully near support. Avoid adding shorts near the lows. If you are holding longs from the demand zone, staying patient is reasonable while price holds above 1.68, but taking partial profit near resistance is wise.\n\nMarket sentiment remains cautious, favoring consolidation and level-based trading rather than chasing moves.","gravity_id":"373351186","id":111940,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T14:20:10.652Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T15:00:10.263Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-30T14:13:43.010Z","text_content":"$XRP  from this price 5$ and 10$ will be very easy for the next bullrun","gravity_id":"373352189","id":111941,"createdAt":"2026-01-30T14:20:10.863Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-30T15:00:10.598Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-30T14:10:29.862Z","text_content":"We get it… you’re not the only one.
