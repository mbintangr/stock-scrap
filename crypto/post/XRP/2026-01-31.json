This is usually the difference between:  - DAOs that exist for optics  - and DAOs that can sustain themselves long-term  The most important governance upgrades rarely look exciting at first. But over time, they define whether a protocol can grow without constant external input.

An XRP community member argues that long-term success will depend on measurable, everyday utility rather than narratives about a global reset.   Recently, some pundits have claimed that a global financial reset is underway, suggesting XRP could benefit due to its utility in cross-border settlements.  However, prominent community figure WrathofKahneman dismisses the “global reset” narrative as a marketing phrase, while highlighting an important factor that could attract institutional clients.   While dismissing the global reset narrative, WrathofKahneman said the only factor that truly matters for XRP is growing daily usefulness. His view reflects a broader community stance that sees the global reset narrative as a distraction from the fundamentals that shape XRP’s value proposition.   \r \r According to this perspective, XRP does not require a sudden systemic shift to succeed. Rather, its relevance will grow organically as real-world adoption expands. As transaction volumes, integrations, and practical applications increase, measurable data will ultimately validate its importance.   \r \r \r According to WrathofKahneman, the numbers that companies cannot ignore refer specifically to sustained growth in daily XRP transaction volume and liquidity. Therefore, he says he anticipates a point at which XRP scales sufficiently to make it economically impractical for firms to ignore its use.   \r \r Although XRP has not yet reached the expected scale, it continues to process billions of dollars in daily transactions. Despite the recent market downturn, XRP records about $3.87 billion in daily volume, which remains well below Bitcoin’s $52.79 billion and Ethereum’s $32.09 billion.   \r \r Nonetheless, community members believe this figure could rise sharply as adoption expands, eventually making XRP too significant to overlook.","gravity_id":"373376510","id":113605,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T09:40:09.215Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T10:10:12.258Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-31T09:35:21.889Z","text_content":"$XRP The elite still needs your cash … keep buying the dips 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣","gravity_id":"373377194","id":113606,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T09:40:09.407Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T10:10:12.608Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-31T09:32:59.848Z","text_content":"$XRP We will see XRP fall to $1 or possibly even $0.60. \nAfter this major correction, we should see increases to $4 to $6. \nTherefore, it is a good time to buy when XRP is trading below $1.","gravity_id":"373377178","id":113607,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T09:40:09.618Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T10:00:11.443Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-31T09:41:40.516Z","text_content":"Top Business Executive Says $XRP   Shackles Are Finally Off.  Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says the regulatory shackles that once limited XRP’s real-world adoption have finally been lifted, potentially opening the door to broader investor exposure.   He shared this view while explaining why Bitwise launched its spot XRP ETF, noting that the token’s investment case now centers more on future optionality than past utility.   For years, regulatory pressure effectively stalled XRP’s growth. Now that these constraints have eased, Bitwise believes investors deserve a simpler, regulated way to gain exposure as the asset enters a new phase.    In a recent interview with 51 Insights, Hougan explained that Bitwise’s decision to launch an XRP ETF reflects both market demand and a shift in the asset’s outlook.   He described XRP as a “Lindy asset,” emphasizing its resilience through prolonged uncertainty and its strong community support. Consequently, XRP’s longevity has sustained investor interest in accessing the token through a regulated vehicle.   Hougan stressed that XRP’s limited real-world adoption stemmed less from technological shortcomings and more from legal uncertainty. The SEC lawsuit, he noted, discouraged institutions and developers from building within the ecosystem. As a result, meaningful partnerships remained unlikely under such pressure.   Now that the lawsuit has been resolved, Hougan believes XRP can compete on equal footing with other blockchain networks. While this shift does not guarantee success for Ripple or XRP, he emphasized that it removes the primary barrier that once constrained growth. Therefore, he argues the asset has become relevant again for investors evaluating new opportunities.","gravity_id":"373377255","id":113625,"createdAt":"2026-01-31T09:50:09.597Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-31T10:20:12.077Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-01-31T09:39:54.190Z","text_content":"Breaking: President Trump officially nominates Kevin Warsh as Fed Chair, stirring markets.  $XRP spikes 7% amid speculation on policy shifts traders on #BingX navigating this volatility with keen interest.

A newly-activated XRP whale address recently accumulated over $206 million worth of XRP within an hour.  \r \r While the wallet amassed the tokens across two transactions worth 60 million XRP each (about $103 million), an interesting twist involved the use of a central address to route the assets through four different transactions within an hour.  \r \r Notably, the accumulation spree follows the latest XRP price collapse, with the asset dropping to a new yearly low below the $1.8 level. Amid a 10% decline since Jan. 29, XRP now changes hands at $1.72, representing its lowest price over the past nine months (excluding the Oct. 10 crash). At this point, it remains unclear if the recent transactions represent part of a “buy-the-dip” campaign or a mere fund shuffle.  On-chain data confirms that the transactions that set things in motion last night involved three unknown addresses, including rGM…Q9j, the XRP whale in question. Specifically, wallet address rJu…YXE received 60 million XRP worth $103 million at the time from the source rpx…ZY1 yesterday at 21:42 UTC.   \r \r A few minutes after this transaction, rJu…YXE routed the 60 million XRP tokens to the whale address rGM…Q9j at 21:56 UTC. Nearly an hour later, rJu…YXE received another batch of 60 million tokens from the source rpx…ZY1. It again transferred these tokens to rGM…Q9j at 22:49 UTC.  \r \r Overall, rGM…Q9j gulped 120 million XRP tokens worth $206 million at the time in less than an hour. Currently, the XRP whale address holds 185 million XRP tokens.

His analysis focuses on XRP’s historical cycle behavior, where major rallies followed specific Fibonacci extension levels after a first impulse move and correction phase.  In past cycles, $XRP   second surge reached major Fibonacci targets, but the 2021 move was cut short, likely due to external pressures. Now, XRP is again in a macro correction zone and testing an important monthly EMA support level that has historically acted as a launch point for continuation moves.  If this structure holds, projected Fibonacci extensions point to potential upside targets around the mid-single digits and possibly higher in an extended run.
