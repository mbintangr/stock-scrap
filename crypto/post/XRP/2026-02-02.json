Price is now testing this level after a sustained decline.  🔸 The RSI is currently below the 30 level, indicating oversold conditions. This may support the possibility of a short-term technical bounce, although the broader trend remains weak.  🔸 A confirmed daily close below this support could lead to further downside toward deeper demand zones around 1.30 – 1.20.  🔸 On the upside, the 1.95 – $2.05 area stands as the first key resistance, followed by a stronger supply zone between $2.35 – $2.45.

Gold exploded higher, then snapped back, while crypto barely moved. The contrast is what caught everyone’s eye - especially when $BTC  and XRP were put side by side with metals.  Here’s the headline math: gold’s market value jumped by roughly $2.2T in a single session. That’s almost 20× the entire market cap of $XRP  , which sits near ~$103B. Even Bitcoin, valued around $1.7T, was eclipsed by gold’s one-day gain.  But this is where scale matters. Gold is massive. A relatively small percentage move in such a huge market turns into trillions on paper. That doesn’t mean trillions of new money suddenly rushed in - it’s just how big markets behave.  Crypto works differently. Smaller pools of capital can move prices much faster - up or down. That’s why silver’s sharp reversal and crypto’s quiet reaction tell the same story: headline numbers look dramatic, but they don’t equal destiny.

The real value has already been agreed upon by central banks behind closed doors—a fixed rate of $1,000+ per token needed to handle global derivatives liquidity.” 🤫🏦\r \r The rumor alleges that a \"Shadow Buyback\" is being prepared, where institutions will sweep the supply before the public ISO 20022 \"switch\" is fully flipped.\r \r Is this the ultimate \"Diamond Hands\" test or just dangerous hopium? 🛑📉\r \r #XRP   #Ripple   #CryptoNews   #XRPCommunity   #Altcoins","gravity_id":"373430211","id":118041,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T05:50:09.735Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T07:00:17.274Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T05:40:43.081Z","text_content":"$XRP 50cents incoming","gravity_id":"373430203","id":118042,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T05:50:10.010Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T07:00:17.651Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T05:54:42.371Z","text_content":"$XRP buying at 1$ 🥰","gravity_id":"373429966","id":118060,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T06:00:10.290Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T07:00:16.635Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T06:04:52.737Z","text_content":"$XRP  will be 1$??","gravity_id":"373431034","id":118073,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T06:10:08.937Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T07:00:16.030Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T06:02:56.004Z","text_content":"New Era Beckons for $FARTCOIN   I see people celebrating that a new era beckons for $FARTCOIN , but I refuse to get distracted by ephemeral meme hype.

No clear bottom in sight yet, but history shows these shakes often precede epic comebacks - question is, who's positioned to weather the storm?  Market Wipeout Breakdown - Total losses hit $700B, erasing gains from recent pumps. - Broader economic jitters amplifying the crypto downturn. - Liquidations spiking across exchanges, fueling the cascade.  Potential Triggers - Regulatory whispers and macro headwinds piling on pressure. - Whale sells adding to the downward momentum. - Sentiment shift from greed to fear in record time.

The trigger was fear around interest rates. News tied to a new U.S. Fed leadership appointment pushed expectations toward “higher for longer” policy. When rates stay high, risk assets struggle - and crypto is now moving almost in lockstep with U.S. equities.  Then leverage made it worse. As prices fell, forced liquidations kicked in. Nearly $5B in leveraged positions were wiped out over three days, turning a macro pullback into a fast cascade. ETH weakness - amplified by reports of large unrealized institutional losses - dragged altcoins down with it.  Here’s how hard it hit:  ▪ Bitcoin: −13% (~$265B erased) ▪ Ethereum: −25% (~$91B erased) ▪ $XRP  : −22% (~$24B erased) ▪ Solana: −23% (~$16B erased)  Sentiment reflects the damage. Fear & Greed sits at 18 (Extreme Fear), and many indicators now show oversold conditions. What happens next depends on one thing: can BTC hold ~$77K? If it does, relief is possible. If not, volatility likely isn’t done yet.  #BTC Price Analysis#  #ETH   #XRP  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373431231","id":118112,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T06:40:09.810Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T07:00:14.837Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T06:36:00.072Z","text_content":"$ZEC   reached the short target at $270 and is seeing a relief bounce, as expected. The move back above the 61.8% retracement near $310 was an important short-term development, likely preventing a deeper continuation toward $200. However, unless price can reclaim $330, the broader structure still favors another test of the $270 area.  The daily 200 SMA remains a key level to monitor. Sustained trading below it increases the probability of a gradual move toward the $200 region.

Ripple CTO Emeritus David Schwartz addressed renewed claims linking Jeffrey Epstein to early crypto projects like Ripple, XRP, and Stellar.  His comments followed the resurfacing of a 2014 email involving Blockstream co-founder Austin Hill, which has recently circulated on X after the release of Epstein-related documents by the U.S. Department of Justice.  Reacting to the discussion, Schwartz said he would not be surprised if the controversy was “just the tip of a giant iceberg”. He argued the bigger problem is the mindset behind such claims.  He stressed that framing parts of crypto as enemies only deepens divisions in an industry where projects are interconnected, ultimately hurting everyone regardless of which network they support. “This kind of attitude hurts everyone in the space,” Schwartz noted.  The controversy centers on a July 2014 email sent by Austin Hill to Joichi Ito, Jeffrey Epstein, and Reid Hoffman. In the message, Hill argued that Ripple and Jed McCaleb’s Stellar were “bad for the ecosystem”.  He stressed that investors backing rival chains were “backing two horses in the same race”. He suggested cutting or removing such investors, saying the overlap was hurting Blockstream and its broader vision.  Screenshots of the email have since spread widely on X. Some users are taking Epstein’s inclusion as proof of early financial influence over Ripple, XRP, or Stellar.  In a separate response, Schwartz directly addressed the speculation, stating that he is unaware of any links between Epstein and XRP, Ripple, or Stellar. He said there is no evidence that anyone at Stellar or Ripple ever met Epstein or worked with individuals closely tied to him.  Schwartz added that while Epstein had indirect connections to figures linked to Bitcoin, this is common among ultra-wealthy individuals and does not suggest control over, or involvement in, specific crypto projects.","gravity_id":"373434299","id":118233,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T10:00:12.392Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T10:10:15.466Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T09:41:56.373Z","text_content":"If exchange reserves drop 10% in a month while price is flat, someone is accumulating aggressively without moving price.

After a strong start to January, $XRP  was rejected near $1.65, triggering a sharp unwind. Since then, broader market weakness has done the rest: over $500B erased from total crypto market cap in days, risk-off everywhere.  What made XRP’s move worse was ETF pressure. Last week saw a record $92.9M outflow from XRP ETFs - the worst single-day and weekly print so far. That matters. It removed a key layer of passive demand just as liquidity thinned.  Technically, the market is now focused on $1.60. Lose it cleanly, and downside opens toward $1.38, then $1.02. On the flip side, any recovery needs to reclaim $1.86 before bulls can argue structure again.  One thing is clear: $XRP  isn’t trading in isolation. Until BTC stabilizes and dominance cools off, rebounds here remain tactical, not trend-changing.

Dr. Russell McGregor has urged Ripple to demand the release of government records relating to Epstein–linked influence on early crypto policy targeting XRP.    The release of the Epstein files has reignited controversy within the crypto community, particularly around XRP. A viral email sparked debate over whether the disgraced financier may have influenced early crypto regulations that negatively affected Ripple, XRP, or Stellar.   This speculation gained momentum after emails surfaced showing Blockstream co-founder Austin Hill urging Jeffrey Epstein and Joichi Ito to withdraw or limit funding for Jed McCaleb–linked projects, notably Ripple and Stellar.   In a July 2014 email titled “Stellar isn’t so stellar,” Hill labeled both companies harmful to the industry. He also argued that backing them would damage crypto’s image, and proposed discussing ways to “deal” with the issue. Consequently, the correspondence revived debate over ideological rifts in early crypto circles.   Reacting, McGregor, a widely followed crypto pundit, suggested that the emails raise broader questions about behind-the-scenes Epstein influence during crypto’s formative years.   Accordingly, he called on Ripple to press the SEC, DOJ, and Congress to disclose whether Epstein-linked individuals or networks shaped early crypto policy, enforcement priorities, or regulatory narratives targeting Ripple, XRP, or Stellar.   He also pointed to former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s prior academic involvement in blockchain education at MIT as an area warranting scrutiny. McGregor suggests that undisclosed influence may have affected policy decisions that later affected Ripple’s regulatory treatment.","gravity_id":"373435219","id":118325,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T10:30:11.614Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T10:40:12.484Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T10:21:10.599Z","text_content":"$XRP the smoke will clear soon dont close your eyes and try to jump out the speeding car, open your eyes and slowly brake and hop on the moon rocket.","gravity_id":"373439090","id":118326,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T10:30:11.884Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T10:40:12.723Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T10:37:10.586Z","text_content":"Bitcoin drops to $78,000 as Strategy-fueled rally runs out of buyers, traders say $BTC   sank to its lowest levels since April as profit-taking by early holders collided with thinning liquidity and a sharp drop-off in fresh capital.  ﻿$XRP  #BTC Price Analysis#  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373434601","id":118330,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T10:40:07.511Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T10:50:12.270Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T10:33:34.617Z","text_content":"#Ripple  has obtained full Electronic Money Institution approval from Luxembourg's Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, enabling expansion of blockchain payment services across the European Union.\r $XRP \r Read More:  https://www.cryptonewslive.org/article/ripple-secures-full-eu-electronic-money-license-from-luxembourg-cssf-after-uk-fca-approval","gravity_id":"373434589","id":118337,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T10:40:10.228Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T10:40:10.228Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T10:45:15.741Z","text_content":"Euclid Protocol Completes $3.5M Seed Round and Seed Round Extension Financing.

Until then, I'd mostly forget about it as price is so far away now so it's not as relevant currently.  ﻿#Altcoin Season#  $XRP  #Macro Insights#","gravity_id":"373438400","id":118462,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T11:40:09.474Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T11:40:13.112Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T11:39:26.693Z","text_content":"🇱🇺 JUST IN: Ripple has been granted a full EU Electronic Money Institution license in Luxembourg. $XRP","gravity_id":"373438417","id":118464,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T11:40:10.536Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T12:10:11.777Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T11:38:05.002Z","text_content":"Early in January, major geopolitical news broke over a weekend ,moves that could have shaken markets ,but traditional exchanges were closed, leaving traders unable to react in real time. By the time U.S. futures reopened, BTC already moved, and weakness in gold and silver was spilling into broader assets.\n\n\nThe same gap shows up with macro shifts. The Federal Reserve rarely changes leadership, but when it does, markets begin repricing immediately. A new Chair brings a different perspective and tone, and expectations alone can move prices. After President Trump named Kevin Warsh as Fed Chair pick last week, investors adjusted across assets, including crypto like $XRP .\n\n\nPlatforms with 24/7 trading, like Bitget, let traders respond as news breaks rather than waiting for markets to open. The Stock Futures Championship is one way to put strategies to the test, showing how timing and quick decisions can make a difference in real time.\n#Macro Insights# #Meme Alpha#","gravity_id":"373439426","id":118465,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T11:40:10.968Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T12:00:13.225Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T11:37:45.103Z","text_content":"Here’s How High #Ripple’s $XRP Price Can Go This Week\n\nhttps://captainaltcoin.com/heres-how-high-ripples-xrp-price-can-go-this-week/","gravity_id":"373435554","id":118466,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T11:40:12.125Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T11:50:13.187Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T11:37:06.475Z","text_content":"$XRP lets go 🚀","gravity_id":"373434879","id":118467,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T11:40:12.339Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T11:40:12.339Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T11:36:52.735Z","text_content":"$XRP #Ripple. 💰\n\n#XRP price is approaching the Buy block between the levels of $1.40 and $1.47.

XRPL developer Bird highlighted XRP’s fourth consecutive monthly negative close in a post on X. He noted that XRP has not printed five red monthly candles in a row since 2017. Over the past eight years, similar conditions have consistently led to a green monthly close.  Based on past data, Bird said the probability of XRP closing a fifth straight red month sits at roughly 30%, implying a 70% chance that February breaks the streak and finishes higher.  Previous cycles show that prolonged monthly weakness in XRP often signals seller exhaustion. Historically, after three or four consecutive months of losses, the following month often turns green.  For instance, in 2022, XRP closed April, May, and June with losses ranging from 21% to 28.4%, then posted 14.6% gains in July. Later that year, it recorded losses from October to December and posted 20% gains in January 2023.  In 2018, XRP posted losses of 26.9%, 23.8%, 6.77%, and 23% from May to August. By September, it surged 73%. The trend repeated later that year, with losses from October to January, followed by a 1.13% gain in February 2019.  The monthly chart highlights how extended red streaks have often aligned with accumulation phases preceding a relief rally.  While historical probabilities lean bullish, broader market conditions remain a key factor. Bitcoin’s direction, overall crypto sentiment, and liquidity trends could influence whether XRP follows its historical pattern or deviates from it.  Moreover, in 2015 and 2014, XRP recorded streaks of five and six consecutive monthly losses, respectively, before gains of 43.8% and 37.3%. This suggests that while there is optimism for a rebound in February, XRP’s price could still close the month in red.  Still, the rarity of the current setup has drawn attention from traders who view February as a pivotal month for XRP’s medium-term direction.","gravity_id":"373436601","id":118842,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T14:00:13.135Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T14:00:13.135Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T14:10:36.265Z","text_content":"$XRP\n\n\nWe've officially entered the final stretch of the Expanded Flat.\n\n\n$1.14-1.60 is basically the zone (waves are tentative and will be updated).\n\n\nThis is the the most emotional phase of the pattern, where Wave C breaks market structure, just like how Wave B did at the top.\n\n\nFOLLOW FOR MORE UPDATES🔥\n#Altcoin Season# #Meme Alpha#","gravity_id":"373437395","id":118867,"createdAt":"2026-02-02T14:12:22.408Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-02T14:20:09.435Z"},{"crypto_id":"52","crypto_name":"XRP","post_time":"2026-02-02T14:09:54.379Z","text_content":"🌌 AI Analysis for $XRP  #XRPUSDT  | 1h finorabot.com \r \r - As it currently looks, I expect a short-term reaction at the resistance zone around 1.6805 USDT.
